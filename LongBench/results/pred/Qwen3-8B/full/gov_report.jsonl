{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about multiyear procurement (MYP) and block buy contracting (BBC) for Congress. Let me start by understanding the key points from the report.\n\nFirst, the report explains that MYP and BBC are special contracting mechanisms used by the Department of Defense (DOD) to potentially reduce procurement costs. They compare these to the standard annual contracting approach. The main issues Congress might consider are whether to use these more, less, or the same as now, whether to create a permanent statute for BBC like there is for MYP, and if the Coast Guard should use them.\n\nThe report differentiates between funding approaches (like traditional full funding, incremental funding) and contracting mechanisms (MYP, BBC, annual). It mentions that MYP involves a single contract for 2-5 years, which can lead to savings through contractor optimizations and economic order quantity (EOQ) purchases. However, actual savings are hard to measure due to cost growth and lack of historical data.\n\nBBC is similar to MYP but without a permanent statute, and it's used less frequently. The Navy has used BBC for some ship programs, but there's no requirement for stable design or cancellation penalties. The report also notes that the Coast Guard hasn't used MYP or BBC yet but could benefit from them, especially for major programs like the Offshore Patrol Cutter.\n\nPotential issues for Congress include the balance between cost savings and reduced flexibility, the need for a permanent statute for BBC, and the Coast Guard's potential use. The report also highlights that while MYP has been used in the past, its share of the DOD budget has decreased, and there's debate on whether to increase its use.\n\nI need to condense all this into a concise one-page summary. I should start with an introduction about MYP and BBC, their purpose, and the main issues for Congress. Then explain how they work, their potential savings, challenges, and the current usage. Mention the Coast Guard's potential role and the debate on increasing or decreasing their use. Also, note the lack of a permanent statute for BBC and the implications of that. Finally, conclude with the key considerations for Congress.\n\nI need to make sure the summary is clear, covers all main points without getting too detailed, and stays within one page. Let me structure it with headings if possible, but since it's a summary, maybe just paragraphs. Avoid jargon where possible, but some terms like MYP and BBC are necessary. Check", "answers": ["Multiyear procurement (MYP) and block buy contracting (BBC) are special contracting mechanisms that Congress permits the Department of Defense (DOD) to use for a limited number of defense acquisition programs. Compared to the standard or default approach of annual contracting, MYP and BBC have the potential for reducing weapon procurement costs by a few or several percent. Under annual contracting, DOD uses one or more contracts for each year's worth of procurement of a given kind of item. Under MYP, DOD instead uses a single contract for two to five years' worth of procurement of a given kind of item without having to exercise a contract option for each year after the first year. DOD needs congressional approval for each use of MYP. There is a permanent statute governing MYP contracting—10 U.S.C. 2306b. Under this statute, a program must meet several criteria to qualify for MYP. Compared with estimated costs under annual contracting, estimated savings for programs being proposed for MYP have ranged from less than 5% to more than 15%, depending on the particulars of the program in question, with many estimates falling in the range of 5% to 10%. In practice, actual savings from using MYP rather than annual contracting can be difficult to observe or verify because of cost growth during the execution of the contract due to changes in the program independent of the use of MYP rather than annual contracting. BBC is similar to MYP in that it permits DOD to use a single contract for more than one year's worth of procurement of a given kind of item without having to exercise a contract option for each year after the first year. BBC is also similar to MYP in that DOD needs congressional approval for each use of BBC. BBC differs from MYP in the following ways: There is no permanent statute governing the use of BBC. There is no requirement that BBC be approved in both a DOD appropriations act and an act other than a DOD appropriations act. Programs being considered for BBC do not need to meet any legal criteria to qualify for BBC, because there is no permanent statute governing the use of BBC that establishes such criteria. A BBC contract can cover more than five years of planned procurements. Economic order quantity (EOQ) authority—the authority to bring forward selected key components of the items to be procured under the contract and purchase the components in batch form during the first year or two of the contract—does not come automatically as part of BBC authority because there is no permanent statute governing the use of BBC that includes EOQ authority as an automatic feature. BBC contracts are less likely to include cancellation penalties. Potential issues for Congress concerning MYP and BBC include whether to use MYP and BBC in the future more frequently, less frequently, or about as frequently as they are currently used; whether to create a permanent statute to govern the use of BBC, analogous to the permanent statute that governs the use of MYP; and whether the Coast Guard should begin making use of MYP and BBC."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8537}

In fiscal year 2016, the total operating and support (O&S) costs for these aircraft amounted to approximately $20 billion, with the Air Force accounting for $13 billion and the Navy for $7 billion. The report notes that aircraft availability for most of the 12 aircraft did not meet their goals, with 9 out of 12 failing to meet availability targets in 2016. Key challenges include aging aircraft, which require extensive repairs and modifications, and maintenance and supply issues that contribute to aircraft being unavailable for missions. The report also highlights the importance of sustainment strategies, such as Life-cycle Sustainment Plans, which are required by DOD policy but not consistently updated for all aircraft, particularly legacy systems. The Air Force has updated its guidance to require sustainment strategies for legacy systems, while the Navy lacks clear guidance on this requirement. The report recommends that the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Navy clarify the requirements for documenting and updating sustainment strategies for legacy systems. Additionally, the report emphasizes the need for improved metrics and data collection to better manage sustainment and ensure the affordability and readiness of these aircraft. The findings underscore the importance of proactive maintenance, supply chain management, and strategic planning to address the challenges faced by these aging aircraft fleets.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report.

The Air Force and Navy are operating many of their fixed-wing aircraft well beyond their original designed service lives and therefore are confronted with sustainment challenges. House Report 114-537 included a provision for GAO to evaluate the sustainment of major weapon systems. This report, among other things, (1) examines the trends in availability and O&S costs for selected Air Force and Navy fixed-wing aircraft since fiscal year 2011, including whether they met availability goals, and (2) assesses the extent that the departments documented sustainment strategies, reviewed sustainment metrics, and implemented plans to improve aircraft availability. GAO selected a nongeneralizable sample of 12 fixed-wing aircraft by considering a variety of factors, such as the type, age, and manufacturer of the aircraft, among other factors, and analyzed condition and availability data, O&S costs, and sustainment challenges from fiscal year 2011 through March 2017 for each aircraft in a “Sustainment Quick Look.” GAO also analyzed policies, strategies, and plans, and interviewed Navy and Air Force officials in program offices, squadrons, and maintenance depots. Between fiscal years 2011 and 2016, the Air Force and Navy generally did not meet aircraft availability goals, and operating and support (O&S) cost trends for GAO's selected fixed-wing aircraft varied. Specifically, GAO found that availability declined for 6 of 12 aircraft—3 from each service—between fiscal years 2011 and 2016; availability fell short of goals for 9 of 12 aircraft in fiscal year 2016; and O&S costs increased for 5 of the aircraft, and maintenance costs—the largest share—increased for 8 of 12 aircraft. GAO found, and officials agreed, that these aircraft face similar challenges. a Obsolescence means a part is unavailable due to its lack of usefulness or it is no longer current or available for production. b Diminishing manufacturing sources is a loss or impending loss of manufacturers or suppliers. The Air Force and Navy have documented sustainment strategies for some aircraft, regularly reviewed sustainment metrics, and implemented improvement plans. The Air Force has documented sustainment strategies for all aircraft GAO reviewed; however, the Navy has not documented or updated its sustainment strategies for four aircraft. Specifically, the Navy does not have a documented sustainment strategy for the C-2A, and has not updated the strategies for the E2C, EA-18G, and F/A-18A-D since before 2012. The Navy is in the process of documenting its strategies, but Department of Defense (DOD) policy is unclear on whether a sustainment strategy is required and has to be updated every 5 years for weapon systems that are in the operations and support phase of their life cycle (i.e., legacy systems). Also, Navy guidance does not specify a requirement for legacy systems, although Air Force guidance does. Clarifying the requirements to document sustainment strategies for legacy systems, and documenting those strategies, would add additional visibility over the availability and O&S costs of DOD aircraft and any associated sustainment risks. This is a public version of a sensitive report issued in April 2018. Information on aircraft availability and other related information was deemed to be sensitive and has been omitted from this report.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are responsible for enforcing laws and treaties to combat this illegal activity. Despite their efforts, the agencies have not prioritized the use of financial rewards as a tool to gather information on wildlife trafficking. From fiscal years 2007 through 2017, FWS reported paying 25 rewards totaling $184,500, while NOAA reported paying 2 rewards totaling $21,000. However, the agencies could not confirm that these figures represented all rewards paid during this period. \n\nThe report outlines the policies and procedures FWS and NOAA have in place for financial rewards, noting that NOAA's policy includes specific factors for determining reward amounts, such as the risk taken by the informant and the significance of the information provided. In contrast, FWS's policy lacks such guidance, leading to inconsistencies in reward amounts. Both agencies have limited public communication about the availability of rewards, which may deter potential informants from coming forward. \n\nStakeholders suggest that FWS and NOAA should enhance their reward policies by specifying factors for determining reward amounts and improving public communication about reward programs. Additionally, the agencies should review the effectiveness of their reward use and consider potential improvements, such as targeted reward offers for high-priority species or criminal networks. The report concludes with recommendations for both agencies to improve their reward tracking, policy development, and public outreach to enhance their efforts in combating wildlife trafficking.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report.

It mentions the estimated value of the illegal trade, the agencies' roles, and their use of financial rewards. \n\nFirst, I should highlight the key statistics: the estimated value of wildlife trafficking, the agencies involved, and their financial reward programs. The report states that the trade is between $7B to $23B annually. FWS and NOAA are the main agencies enforcing laws against this. They have some reward systems, but the report points out that they haven't prioritized using rewards effectively.\n\nNext, the report details the number of rewards paid by each agency.

FWS and NOAA enforce laws prohibiting wildlife trafficking that authorize the agencies to pay financial rewards for information about such illegal activities. GAO was asked to review FWS's and NOAA's use of financial rewards to combat wildlife trafficking. This report examines (1) laws that authorize FWS and NOAA to pay rewards for information on wildlife trafficking and the extent to which the agencies paid such rewards from fiscal years 2007 through 2017, (2) the agencies' reward policies, (3) information available to the public on rewards, and (4) the extent to which the agencies reviewed the effectiveness of their use of rewards. GAO reviewed laws, examined FWS and NOAA policies and public communications on rewards, analyzed agency reward data for fiscal years 2007 through 2017 and assessed their reliability, interviewed FWS and NOAA officials, and compared agency policies and public communications on rewards to federal internal control standards. Multiple laws—such as the Endangered Species Act and Lacey Act—authorize the Departments of the Interior's U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to pay rewards for information on wildlife trafficking. FWS and NOAA reported paying few rewards from fiscal years 2007 through 2017. Specifically, the agencies collectively reported paying 27 rewards, totaling $205,500. Agency officials said that the information was complete to the best of their knowledge but could not sufficiently assure that this information represented all of their reward payments. FWS and NOAA have reward policies that outline the general process for preparing reward proposals, but FWS's policy does not specify factors for its agents to consider when developing proposed reward amounts. Some FWS agents GAO interviewed said that in developing proposals, they did not know whether their proposed reward amounts were enough, too little, or too much. By augmenting its policy to specify factors for agents to consider, FWS can better ensure that its agents have the necessary quality information to prepare proposed reward amounts, consistent with federal internal control standards. FWS and NOAA communicate little information to the public on rewards. For example, most agency websites did not indicate that providing information on wildlife trafficking could qualify for a reward. This is inconsistent with federal standards that call for management to communicate quality information so that external parties can help achieve agency objectives. FWS and NOAA officials said they have not communicated general reward information because of workload concerns, but they said it may be reasonable to provide more information in some instances. By developing plans to communicate more reward information to the public, the agencies can improve their chances of obtaining information on wildlife trafficking that they otherwise might not receive. FWS and NOAA have not reviewed the effectiveness of their use of rewards. The agencies have not done so because using rewards has generally not been a priority. FWS and NOAA officials agreed that such a review would be worthwhile but provided no plans for doing so. By reviewing the effectiveness of their use of rewards, FWS and NOAA can identify opportunities to improve the usefulness of rewards as a tool for combating wildlife trafficking. GAO is making seven recommendations, including that FWS and NOAA track reward information, FWS augment its reward policy to specify factors for agents to consider when developing proposed reward amounts, FWS and NOAA develop plans to communicate more reward information to the public, and FWS and NOAA review the effectiveness of their reward use.

These flows enable international trade, communication", "answers": ["\"Cross-border data flows\" refers to the movement or transfer of information between computer servers across national borders. Such data flows enable people to transmit information for online communication, track global supply chains, share research, provide cross-border services, and support technological innovation. Ensuring open cross-border data flows has been an objective of Congress in recent trade agreements and in broader U.S. international trade policy. The free flow of personal data, however, has raised security and privacy concerns. U.S. trade policy has traditionally sought to balance the need for cross-border data flows, which often include personal data, with online privacy and security. Some stakeholders, including some Members of Congress, believe that U.S. policy should better protect personal data privacy and security, and have introduced legislation to set a national policy. Other policymakers and analysts are concerned about increasing foreign barriers to U.S. digital trade, including data flows. Recent incidents of private information being shared or exposed have heightened public awareness of the risks posed to personal data stored online. Consumers' personal online data is valued by organizations for a variety of reasons, such as analyzing marketing information and easing the efficiency of transactions. Concerns are likely to grow as the amount of online data organizations collect and the level of global data flows expand. As Congress assesses policy options, it may further explore the link between cross-border data flows, online privacy, and trade policy; the trade implications of a comprehensive data privacy policy; and the U.S. role in establishing best practices and binding trade rules that seek to balance public policy priorities. There is no globally accepted standard or definition of data privacy in the online world, and there are no comprehensive binding multilateral rules specifically about cross-border data flows and privacy. Several international organizations, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), G-20, and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, have sought to develop best practice guidelines or principles related to privacy and cross-border data flows, although none are legally binding. U.S. and other recent trade agreements are establishing new enforceable trade rules and disciplines. Countries vary in their data policies and laws; some focus on limiting access to online information by restricting the flow of data beyond a country's borders, aiming to protect domestic interests (e.g., constituents' privacy). However, these policies can also act as protectionist measures. The EU and China, two top U.S. trading partners, have established prescriptive rules on cross-border data flows and personal data from different perspectives. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is driven by privacy concerns; China is focused on security. Their policies affect U.S. firms seeking to do business in those regions, as well as in other markets that emulate the EU and Chinese approaches. Unlike the EU or China, the United States does not broadly restrict cross-border data flows and has traditionally regulated privacy at a sectoral level to cover data, such as health records. U.S. trade policy has sought to balance the goals of consumer privacy, security, and open commerce. The proposed United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) represents the Trump Administration's first attempt to include negotiated trade rules and disciplines on privacy, cross-border data flows, and security in a trade agreement. While the United States and other countries work to define their respective national privacy strategies, many stakeholders seek a more global approach that would allow interoperability between differing national regimes to facilitate and remove discriminatory trade barriers to cross-border data flows; this could offer an opportunity for the United States to lead the global conversation. Although Congress has examined issues surrounding online privacy and has considered multiple bills, there is not yet consensus on a comprehensive U.S. online data privacy policy.

{"pred": " The report outlines the federal government's multifaceted approach to supporting airport infrastructure development in the United States. It details three primary funding mechanisms: the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), which provides federal grants for planning and capital projects; the Passenger Facility Charge (PFC), a local fee on passengers that can fund a broader range of projects; and tax-exempt bonds issued by state and local governments. The report traces the evolution of federal involvement in airport development, starting with World War II and continuing through various legislative acts, including the 1946 Federal Airport Act and the 1982 Airport and Airway Improvement Act, which established the current AIP. It highlights the role of the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, which is funded by aviation-related taxes and serves as a primary source of funding for FAA activities and airport grants. The report also discusses the distribution of AIP funds through formula grants and discretionary funds, with varying federal shares based on airport type and size. It addresses the challenges and debates surrounding AIP funding, including the balance between supporting small airports and major hubs, the impact of PFCs on funding, and the role of private ownership and bond financing. The report concludes with an analysis of the estimated capital needs for the national airport system and the implications for future AIP reauthorization and funding decisions.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this detailed report on federal airport infrastructure support. Let me start by understanding the key points. The report explains three main funding sources: AIP grants, PFCs, and tax-exempt bonds. It also covers the historical development of federal involvement, starting from WWII, and the legislative acts that shaped the current system. There's a lot about how funds are distributed through formulas and discretionary grants, the role of the trust fund, and debates around funding priorities. \n\nFirst, I should structure the summary to cover the main funding mechanisms, their purposes, and how they've evolved.

Avoid too much detail on specific acts or formulas unless they're critical. Highlight the key points: the", "answers": ["There are five major sources of airport capital development funding: the federal Airport Improvement Program (AIP); local passenger facility charges (PFCs) imposed pursuant to federal law; tax-exempt bonds; state and local grants; and airport operating revenue from tenant lease and other revenue-generating activities such as landing fees. Federal involvement is most consequential in AIP, PFCs, and tax-exempt financing. The AIP has been providing federal grants for airport development and planning since the passage of the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 (P.L. 97-248). AIP funding is usually spent on projects that support aircraft operations such as runways, taxiways, aprons, noise abatement, land purchase, and safety or emergency equipment. The funds obligated for AIP are drawn from the airport and airway trust fund, which is supported by a variety of user fees and fuel taxes. Different airports use different combinations of these sources depending on the individual airport's financial situation and the type of project being considered. Although smaller airports' individual grants are of much smaller dollar amounts than the grants going to large and medium hub airports, the smaller airports are much more dependent on AIP to meet their capital needs. This is particularly the case for noncommercial airports, which received over 25% of AIP grants distributed in FY2018. Larger airports are much more likely to issue tax-exempt bonds or finance capital projects with the proceeds of PFCs. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-254) provided annual AIP funding of $3.35 billion from the airport and airway trust fund for five years from FY2019 to FY2023. The act left the basic structure of AIP unchanged, but authorized supplemental annual funding of over $1 billion from the general fund to the AIP discretionary funds, starting with $1.02 billion in FY2019, and required at least 50% of the additional discretionary funds to be available to nonhub and small hub airports. The act included a provision permitting eligible projects at small airports (including those in the State Block Grant Program) to receive a 95% federal share of project costs (otherwise capped at 90%), if such projects are determined to be successive phases of a multiphase construction project that received a grant in FY2011. The 2018 reauthorization expanded the number of states that could participate in the State Block Grant Program from 10 to 20 and also expanded the existing airport privatization pilot program (now renamed the Airport Investment Partnership Program) to include more than 10 airports. The law included a provision that forbids states or local governments from levying or collecting taxes on a business at an airport that \"is not generally imposed on sales or services by that State, political subdivision, or authority unless wholly utilized for airport or aeronautical purposes.\" The airport improvement issues Congress generally faces in the context of FAA reauthorization include the following: Should airport development funding be increased or decreased? Should the $4.50 ceiling on PFCs be eliminated, raised, or kept as it is? Could AIP be restructured to address congestion at the busiest U.S. airports, or should a large share of AIP resources continue to go to noncommercial airports that lack other sources of funding? Should Congress set tighter limits on the purposes for which AIP and PFC funds may be spent?

MILCON funds are generally available for 5 years, after which unobligated balances are returned to the Treasury. The report highlights that while DOD has high obligation and expenditure rates for MILCON funds, cost estimates for projects often lack reliability due to shortcomings in the Unified Facilities Criteria, which is the primary guidance for cost estimation. The GAO’s Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide outlines 12 best practices for reliable cost estimates, but the Unified Facilities Criteria does not fully incorporate these steps. This leads to discrepancies between initial cost estimates and final contract awards, resulting in savings or shortfalls. The report provides examples of projects where cost estimates were significantly overestimated, necessitating reprogramming of funds. It recommends that DOD fully integrate the 12 steps from the GAO guide into the Unified Facilities Criteria to improve the reliability of cost estimates, ensuring better decision-making for appropriations and project oversight.

The Unified Facilities Criteria, which is the main guidance for cost estimation, doesn't fully include the 12 best practices from the GAO's Cost Estimating Guide. This leads to discrepancies between initial estimates and actual costs, causing either savings or overruns. Examples are given where projects had significant cost increases, leading to reprogramming of funds.\n\nThe GAO recommends that DOD integrate all 12 steps from the Cost Guide into the", "answers": ["Between fiscal years 2005 and 2016, Congress annually appropriated between $2.5 to $9.6 billion in MILCON funding for the active component of the U.S. military to use for projects worldwide. Reliable project construction cost estimates are of great importance, since those estimates drive these appropriations. House Report 114-537 accompanying a proposed bill authorizing national defense activities for fiscal year 2017 included a provision for GAO to report on DOD's MILCON cost estimating. This report examines the extent to which (1) the active component obligated and expended the MILCON appropriations received during fiscal years 2005-2016, (2) the active component reprogrammed MILCON appropriations during fiscal years 2010 through 2016, and (3) DOD's MILCON cost estimates are reliable for selected projects and DOD's guidance for developing estimates fully incorporates the steps needed for developing reliable estimates. GAO analyzed the active components' MILCON execution data and reviewed DOD's guidance for cost estimating and compared it with the best practices identified in GAO's Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide . During fiscal years 2005 through 2016, Congress appropriated about $66 billion in military construction funds (MILCON) to the active duty Army, Navy, and Air Force (referred to as the active component) for projects. As of September 30, 2016, the active component had obligated all but about $5.1 billion and expended all but about $11 billion of those funds. Of the $5.1 billion remaining unobligated, about $4.6 billion was still available to be obligated because MILCON appropriations are generally available for new obligations for 5 years. According to Department of Defense (DOD) officials, available but unobligated amounts no longer needed may be either taken back by Congress or reprogrammed to other MILCON projects that the active component identifies as needing additional funding. During fiscal years 2010 through 2016, the active component reprogrammed about $1.6 billion in MILCON appropriations to fund emergency projects, projects that were authorized but did not receive specific appropriations, and projects needing additional funding. Of this amount, the Army reprogrammed about $789 million; the Navy, about $535 million; and the Air Force, about $295 million. DOD's guidance does not fully incorporate the steps needed for developing reliable estimates and the estimates for three projects that GAO reviewed were not reliable. Specifically, two of the three high-value projects GAO examined experienced a more than 30-percent increase from the initial cost estimates submitted to Congress. GAO determined that DOD cost estimators did not follow all the best practices associated with the four characteristics—comprehensive, well-documented, accurate, and credible—of a reliable estimate for these projects. GAO's Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide identifies 12 steps that, if used, are more likely to result in reliable and valid cost estimates. However, as shown below, DOD's construction guidance—the Unified Facilities Criteria—does not include all of these steps. Until DOD incorporates these steps, DOD and congressional decision-makers may not have reliable estimates to inform their decisions regarding appropriations and the oversight of projects. GAO recommends that DOD ensure that its cost estimating guidance fully incorporate the steps needed for developing reliable cost estimates.

The FSA (Federal Student Aid) is responsible for ensuring schools meet these standards. They have to do things like communication, personnel, policies, and financial oversight. \n\nThen there's a part about compliance audits. Schools have to submit annual compliance audits, and the OIG (Office of Inspector General) checks the quality of these audits. The OIG selects samples each year and found that a significant number of audits had quality issues. For example, in 2016, they found 264 deficiencies in 41 audits. The main issues were reporting, student eligibility, and administrative capability. \n\nThe report also talks about the certification process. Schools can be provisionally certified, which is for new schools or those not fully compliant. Provisional schools have more oversight. The FSA uses different recertification statuses—full or provisional—and the rates vary by school type. For-profit schools have higher denial rates compared to public and nonprofit. \n\nThere's a section on how FSA and OIG are addressing audit quality. They've done training for auditors, improved guidance, and are working on updating audit guides. The OIG revised the audit guide for for-profit schools in 2016, which might help improve audit quality. \n\nI need to condense all this into a one-page summary. Let me structure it: start with the main requirements for schools, then the certification process, the role of compliance audits and OIG's role, the issues found in audits, and the steps taken to improve audit quality. Also mention the outcomes of certification and the collaboration between FSA and OIG. \n\nWait, the user wants a one-page summary, so I need to be concise. Let me make sure I don't miss key points like the denial rates, the differences between school types, and the impact of audit quality on recertification decisions. Also, the part where FSA uses program reviews and compliance audits, and how sometimes the findings differ. \n\nI should mention the OIG's findings about audit quality, the training initiatives,", "answers": ["Education provided over $122 billion in grants, loans and work study funds to help students pay for college at about 6,000 schools in fiscal year 2017. Education is responsible for certifying that these schools are eligible for and capable of properly administering federal student aid funds. Schools are required to submit an annual compliance audit that provides information on schools' administrative capability, which Education considers in its school certification decisions. GAO was asked to review Education's process for certifying schools to receive federal student aid. This report examines (1) how Education certifies schools to administer federal student aid and how frequently schools are approved and denied certification; and (2) the role of compliance audits in the certification process and what, if any, steps Education has taken to address the quality of the audit information. GAO analyzed data on school certification outcomes for calendar years 2006-2017 (when GAO determined data were most reliable); reviewed data and reports summarizing Education's reviews of compliance audit quality for fiscal years 2006-2017; reviewed a non-generalizable sample of 21 school certification decisions from fiscal years 2015 and 2016, selected for a mix of decisions, school characteristics, and geographic regions; examined relevant federal laws, regulations, policy manuals and guidance; and interviewed Education officials. The Department of Education (Education) is responsible for evaluating a variety of information to determine whether a postsecondary school should be certified to administer federal student aid programs, and agency data show that it approves most schools that apply. Education procedures instruct regional office staff to review school policies, financial statements, and compliance audits prepared by independent auditors, among other things. Education can certify schools to participate in federal student aid programs for up to 6 years, or it can provisionally certify them for less time if it determines that increased oversight is needed—for example, when a school applies for certification for the first time or when it has met some but not all requirements to be fully certified. In calendar years 2006 through 2017, Education fully or provisionally approved most schools applying for initial or recertification to receive federal student aid (see figure). Note: Schools applying for certification for the first time and approved are placed in provisional certification. In deciding whether to certify schools, Education particularly relies on compliance audits for direct information about how well schools are administering federal student aid, and Education's offices of Federal Student Aid and Inspector General have taken steps to address audit quality. The Inspector General annually selects a sample of compliance audits for quality reviews based on risk factors, such as auditors previously cited for errors. In fiscal years 2006 through 2017, 59 percent of the 739 selected audits received failing scores. Audits that fail must be corrected; if not, the school generally must repay federal student aid covered by the audit. Because higher risk audits are selected for review, Inspector General officials said they cannot assess the overall prevalence of quality problems in compliance audits. These two Education offices have taken steps to improve audit quality. For example, the Inspector General offered additional training to auditors on its revised 2016 audit guide and provided guidance to schools on hiring an auditor, while Federal Student Aid created a working group to strengthen its procedures for addressing poor quality compliance audits. Education's efforts to address audit quality could help ensure that these audits provide reliable information for school certification decisions.

{"pred": " The report highlights the persistent cybersecurity challenges faced by federal agencies, emphasizing the need for improved implementation of federal cybersecurity strategies and the effective use of intrusion detection and prevention capabilities. According to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 2018 annual FISMA report, federal agencies reported 35,277 information security incidents in fiscal year 2017, involving threats such as web-based attacks, phishing, and equipment theft. These incidents underscore the vulnerability of federal systems and the potential risks to national security, economic stability, and personal privacy. Notable examples include the 2018 indictment of Iranian hackers for stealing data from U.S. universities and companies, and the 2015 breach of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) affecting millions of federal employees. The federal cybersecurity framework, based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, outlines five core functions—Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover—to manage cybersecurity risks. However, the report finds that many agencies have not effectively implemented these strategies, with 17 of 23 civilian CFO Act agencies reporting significant information security deficiencies. Despite initiatives like the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program and the Network Security Deployment (NSD) division's NCPS system, challenges remain, including incomplete implementation, limited detection capabilities, and insufficient training for agencies. The Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015 mandates that DHS and OMB enhance intrusion detection and prevention capabilities, but the report notes that OMB has not fully met its reporting obligations to Congress, and DHS's NCPS system still has limitations in detecting certain threats. The report also highlights the need for better coordination between agencies and the federal government to address cybersecurity risks, improve training and guidance, and ensure compliance with cybersecurity standards. Recommendations include strengthening OMB's oversight, improving the implementation of the NIST framework, and enhancing the effectiveness of intrusion detection systems. Overall, the report underscores the critical importance of a coordinated, comprehensive approach to federal cybersecurity to mitigate risks and protect sensitive information.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report. Let me start by reading through the report again to get the main points. The report talks about cybersecurity incidents affecting federal agencies, the number of incidents reported, examples like the Iranian hacking and OPM breach, the federal strategies like FISMA and the NIST framework, and the challenges in implementation. There's also mention of programs like NCPS and CDM, their limitations, and recommendations for improvement", "answers": ["Federal agencies are dependent on information systems to carry out operations. The risks to these systems are increasing as security threats evolve and become more sophisticated. To reduce the risk of a successful cyberattack, agencies can deploy intrusion detection and prevention capabilities on their networks and systems. GAO first designated federal information security as a government-wide high-risk area in 1997. In 2015, GAO expanded this area to include protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information. Most recently, in September 2018, GAO updated the area to identify 10 critical actions that the federal government and other entities need to take to address major cybersecurity challenges. The federal approach and strategy for securing information systems is grounded in the provisions of the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 and Executive Order 13800. The act requires agencies to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide program to secure their information systems. The Executive Order, issued in May 2017, directs agencies to use the National Institute of Standards and Technology's cybersecurity framework to manage cybersecurity risks. The Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015 contained a provision for GAO to report on the effectiveness of the government's approach and strategy for securing its systems. GAO determined (1) the reported effectiveness of agencies' implementation of the government's approach and strategy; (2) the extent to which DHS and OMB have taken steps to facilitate the use of intrusion detection and prevention capabilities to secure federal systems; and (3) the extent to which agencies reported implementing capabilities to detect and prevent intrusions. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed OMB reports related to agencies' information security practices including OMB's annual report to Congress for fiscal year 2017. GAO also analyzed and summarized agency-reported security performance metrics and IG-reported information for the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies. In addition, GAO evaluated plans, reports, and other documents related to DHS intrusion detection and prevention programs, and interviewed OMB, DHS, and agency officials. The 23 civilian agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO Act) have often not effectively implemented the federal government's approach and strategy for securing information systems (see figure below). Until agencies more effectively implement the government's approach and strategy, federal systems will remain at risk. To illustrate: As required by Office of Management and Budget (OMB), inspectors general (IGs) evaluated the maturity of their agencies' information security programs using performance measures associated with the five core security functions—identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. The IGs at 17 of the 23 agencies reported that their agencies' programs were not effectively implemented. IGs also evaluated information security controls as part of the annual audit of their agencies' financial statements, identifying material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal controls for financial reporting at 17 of the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies. Chief information officers (CIOs) for 17 of the 23 agencies reported not meeting all elements of the government's cybersecurity cross-agency priority goal. The goal was intended to improve cybersecurity performance through, among other things, maintaining ongoing awareness of information security, vulnerabilities, and threats; and implementing technologies and processes that reduce malware risk. Executive Order 13800 directed OMB, in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), to assess and report on the sufficiency and appropriateness of federal agencies' processes for managing cybersecurity risks. Using performance measures for each of the five core security functions, OMB determined that 13 of the 23 agencies were managing overall enterprise risks, while the other 10 agencies were at risk. In assessing agency risk by core security function, OMB identified a few agencies to be at high risk (see figure at the top of next page). DHS and OMB facilitated the use of intrusion detection and prevention capabilities to secure federal agency systems, but further efforts remain. For example, in response to prior GAO recommendations, DHS had improved the capabilities of the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS), which is intended to detect and prevent malicious traffic from entering agencies' computer networks. However, the system still had limitations, such as not having the capability to scan encrypted traffic. The department was also in the process of enhancing the capabilities of federal agencies to automate network monitoring for malicious activity through its Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program. However, the program was running behind schedule and officials at most agencies indicated the need for additional training and guidance. Further, the Federal CIO issued a mandated report assessing agencies' intrusion detection and prevention capabilities, but the report did not address required information, such as the capability of NCPS to detect advanced persistent threats, and a cost/benefit comparison of capabilities to commercial technologies and tools. Selected agencies had not consistently implemented capabilities to detect and prevent intrusions into their computer networks. Specifically, the agencies told GAO that they had not fully implemented required actions for protecting email, cloud services, host-based systems, and network traffic from malicious activity. For example, 21 of 23 agencies had not, as of September 2018, sufficiently enhanced email protection through implementation of DHS' directive on enhanced email security. In addition, less than half of the agencies that use cloud services reported monitoring these services. Further, most of the selected 23 agencies had not fully implemented the tools and services available through the first two phases of DHS's CDM program. Until agencies more thoroughly implement capabilities to detect and prevent intrusions, federal systems and the information they process will be vulnerable to malicious threats. GAO is making two recommendations to DHS, to among other things, coordinate with agencies to identify additional needs for training and guidance. GAO is also making seven recommendations to OMB to, among other things, direct the Federal CIO to update the mandated report with required information, such as detecting advanced persistent threats. DHS concurred with GAO's recommendations. OMB did not indicate whether it concurred with the recommendations or not."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12551}

According to the Department of State, this assistance to the Palestinians promotes U.S. economic and political foreign policy interests by supporting Middle East peace negotiations and financing economic stabilization programs. USAID is primarily responsible for administering ESF assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. Appropriations acts for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 included provisions for GAO to review the treatment, handling, and uses of funds provided through the ESF for assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. This report examines (1) the status of ESF assistance and projects provided to the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016, including project assistance and payments to PA creditors, and (2) the extent to which USAID conducted required vetting of PA creditors to ensure that this assistance would not support entities or individuals associated with terrorism and assessed PA ministries' capacity to use ESF assistance as intended. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations and USAID financial data, policies, procedures, and documents. GAO also interviewed USAID and State Department officials. As of March 2018, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) had allocated about $545 million of funding appropriated to the Economic Support Fund (ESF) for assistance in the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016. USAID obligated about $544 million (over 99 percent) and expended about $351 million (over 64 percent) of the total allocations. Project assistance accounted for approximately $399 million of the obligated funds, while payments to Palestinian Authority (PA) creditors accounted for $145 million (see figure). USAID's obligations for project assistance in the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 supported three development objectives—Economic Growth and Infrastructure ($239 million), Investing in the Next Generation ($107 million), and Governance and Civic Engagement (about $25 million). In fiscal years 2015 and 2016, USAID made payments directly to PA creditors—two Israeli fuel companies, to cover debts for petroleum purchases, and a local Palestinian bank, to pay off a line of credit used for PA medical referrals to six hospitals in the East Jerusalem Hospital network. USAID vetted PA creditors to ensure that the program assistance would not provide support to entities or individuals associated with terrorism and also conducted external assessments and financial audits of PA ministries of Health and Finance and Planning. USAID documentation showed that, as required, officials checked the vetting status of each PA creditor within 12 months before USAID signed its debt relief grant agreements with the PA. In addition, although USAID determined that it was not legally required to assess the PA Ministry of Health's medical referral services and the Ministry of Finance and Planning's petroleum procurement system, the agency commissioned external assessments of both ministries. These assessments found some weaknesses in both ministries' systems; however, USAID mission officials stated that these weaknesses did not affect USAID debt relief payments to the PA creditors. Nevertheless, USAID took additional steps to mitigate the identified weaknesses. For example, a USAID contractor worked with the Ministry of Health to update, revise, and approve guidelines for medical referrals. In addition, USAID commissioned financial audits of the debt relief grant agreements between USAID and the PA for direct payments to PA creditors in fiscal year 2015 and 2016.

{"pred": " The report discusses the U.S. government's efforts to improve small business access to capital, particularly through the Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF), established as part of the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010. Small businesses have historically played a key role in job creation, especially during economic recoveries, but faced significant challenges during the 2007-2009 recession, accounting for nearly 60% of net job losses. In response, Congress passed several laws to enhance small business lending, including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, which created the SBLF. The SBLF aimed to increase lending to small businesses by providing up to $30 billion in capital investments to eligible financial institutions, with incentives tied to increases in small business lending. The program was designed to encourage community banks and other lenders to provide more credit to small businesses, which are critical for job growth. However, the SBLF faced criticism for its potential to increase the federal deficit, lack of oversight, and concerns that it might not effectively stimulate lending. Despite these concerns, the program was implemented, with participating institutions reporting increased small business lending. However, audits raised questions about the validity of these reported gains, suggesting that some increases occurred before SBLF funding and were not directly attributable to the program. The report also highlights ongoing debates about the best approach to support small businesses, with some advocating for additional federal resources and others favoring tax cuts and regulatory reforms to promote economic growth. The SBLF's long-term impact remains a subject of discussion, with mixed assessments of its effectiveness in boosting small business lending and job creation.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report. Let me start by reading through the summary provided and then the original report to make sure I capture all the key points. \n\nThe summary mentions the government's efforts to improve small business access to capital, especially through the SBLF.

The SBLF's purpose, structure, and criticisms are outlined, along with the mixed results and ongoing debates.\n\nNow, I need to condense this into a concise one-page summary. Let me structure it with an introduction, key points about the SBL", "answers": ["Congressional interest in small business access to capital has increased in recent years because of concerns that small businesses might be prevented from accessing sufficient capital to enable them to start, continue, or expand operations and create jobs. Some have argued that the federal government should provide additional resources to assist small businesses. Others worry about the long-term adverse economic effects of spending programs that increase the federal deficit. They advocate business tax reduction, reform of financial credit market regulation, and federal fiscal restraint as the best means to assist small businesses and create jobs. Several laws were enacted during the 111th Congress to enhance small business access to capital. For example, P.L. 111-5, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), provided the Small Business Administration (SBA) an additional $730 million, including funding to temporarily subsidize SBA fees and increase the 7(a) loan guaranty program's maximum loan guaranty percentage to 90%. P.L. 111-240, the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a $30 billion Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF), in which $4.0 billion was issued, to encourage community banks with less than $10 billion in assets to increase their lending to small businesses. It also authorized a $1.5 billion State Small Business Credit Initiative to provide funding to participating states with small business capital access programs, numerous changes to the SBA's loan guaranty and contracting programs, funding to continue the SBA's fee subsidies and the 7(a) program's 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage through December 31, 2010, and about $12 billion in tax relief for small businesses. P.L. 111-322, the Continuing Appropriations and Surface Transportation Extensions Act, 2011, authorized the SBA to continue its fee subsidies and the 7(a) program's 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage through March 4, 2011, or until available funding was exhausted, which occurred on January 3, 2011. This report focuses on the SBLF. It opens with a discussion of the supply and demand for small business loans. The SBLF's advocates claimed the SBLF was needed to enhance the supply of small business loans. The report then examines other arguments presented both for and against the program. Advocates argued that the SBLF would increase lending to small businesses and, in turn, create jobs. Opponents contended that the SBLF could lose money, lacked sufficient oversight provisions, did not require lenders to increase their lending to small businesses, could serve as a vehicle for Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients to effectively refinance their TARP loans on more favorable terms with little or no resulting benefit for small businesses, and could encourage a failing lender to make even riskier loans to avoid higher dividend payments. The report concludes with an examination of the program's implementation and a discussion of bills introduced to amend the SBLF. For example, during the 112th Congress, S. 681, the Greater Accountability in the Lending Fund Act of 2011, would have limited the program's authority to 15 years from enactment and prohibited TARP recipients from participating in the program. H.R. 2807, the Small Business Leg-Up Act of 2011, would have transferred any unobligated and repaid funds from the SBLF to the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund \"to increase the availability of credit for small businesses.\" H.R. 3147, the Small Business Lending Extension Act, would have extended the Department of the Treasury's investment authority from one year to two years.

This goal reflects a strategic shift toward addressing renewed great power competition with China and Russia, emphasizing the need for a more distributed naval architecture with a mix of large and small surface combatants, as well as unmanned systems. The FY2020 budget requests funding for 12 new ships, including one Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carrier, three Virginia-class submarines, three DDG-51 destroyers, one FFG(X) frigate, and others. The report highlights the Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan, which aims to reach 355 ships by FY2034, but notes potential affordability challenges, particularly due to the high costs of programs like the Columbia-class submarine. Congressional oversight is critical, as decisions on funding and modifying the shipbuilding plan will impact Navy capabilities, the industrial base, and long-term strategic goals. The report also addresses the Navy's shift toward Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO), which leverages new technologies and networking to enhance operational flexibility. Affordability concerns, including potential cost overruns and the need for stable funding, are emphasized, with the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projecting higher costs than the Navy's estimates.

The 355-ship force-level goal is the result of a Force Structure Assessment (FSA) conducted by the Navy in 2016. The Navy states that a new FSA is now underway as the successor to the 2016 FSA. This new FSA, Navy officials state, is to be completed by the end of 2019. Navy officials have suggested in their public remarks that this new FSA could change the 355-ship figure, the planned mix of ships, or both. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests funding for the procurement of 12 new ships, including one Gerald R.

If the FY2020 30-year shipbuilding plan is implemented, the Navy projects that it will achieve a total of 355 ships by FY2034. This is about 20 years sooner than projected under the Navy's FY2019 30-year shipbuilding plan—an acceleration primarily due to a decision announced by the Navy in April 2018, after the FY2019 plan was submitted, to increase the service lives of all DDG-51 destroyers to 45 years. Although the Navy projects that the fleet will reach a total of 355 ships in FY2034, the Navy in that year and subsequent years will not match the composition called for in the FY2016 FSA. One issue for Congress is whether the new FSA that the Navy is conducting will change the 355-ship force-level objective established by the 2016 FSA and, if so, in what ways.

{"pred": " The report discusses the Small Business Administration's (SBA) 7(a) loan program, which guarantees loans to small businesses, and evaluates how the SBA monitors lenders' compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement. The 7(a) program is designed to assist small businesses that cannot obtain conventional credit at reasonable terms. Lenders, including banks and non-bank entities, are responsible for determining if a borrower meets the credit elsewhere requirement, which ensures that the borrower cannot obtain credit from other sources. The SBA relies on lenders with delegated authority to make these determinations, and the agency conducts on-site and off-site reviews to ensure compliance. However, the report highlights that there is a high rate of noncompliance with the credit elsewhere documentation requirement, and SBA does not consistently document its assessments of lenders' policies and practices. This lack of documentation limits SBA's ability to effectively monitor compliance and ensure that the program serves its intended population. The report also finds that SBA does not routinely collect or analyze information on the criteria lenders use for credit elsewhere justifications, which hinders its ability to identify patterns in lender practices. The report recommends that SBA require reviewers to document their assessments of lenders' policies, collect information on lenders' use of credit elsewhere criteria, and analyze this data to identify at-risk lenders. The report also discusses disparities in credit access among small businesses based on characteristics such as gender, minority status, and business age, and notes that certain groups, such as new businesses and women-owned businesses, are more likely to receive 7(a) loans. The findings suggest that the SBA needs to improve its oversight and data collection to ensure the program effectively supports small businesses in need.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this detailed report about the SBA's 7(a) loan program. Let me start by understanding the main points. The report is about how the SBA ensures that lenders comply with the credit elsewhere requirement, which is crucial for the 7(a) program. The SBA guarantees loans to small businesses that can't get conventional credit. Lenders, especially those with delegated authority, have to check if the borrower can't get credit elsewhere. \n\nThe report mentions that SBA has issues with lenders not properly documenting their compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement.

This report discusses, among other things, (1) how SBA monitors lenders' compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement, (2) the extent to which SBA evaluates trends in lender credit elsewhere practices, and (3) lenders' views on the credit elsewhere criteria for 7(a) loans. GAO analyzed SBA data on 7(a) loans approved for fiscal years 2007–2016, the latest available, and reviewed literature on small business lending; reviewed standard operating procedures, other guidance, and findings from SBA reviews performed in fiscal year 2016; and interviewed lender associations and a nonrepresentative sample of 7(a) lenders selected that concentrated on larger lenders. For its 7(a) loan program, the Small Business Administration (SBA) has largely delegated authority to lenders to make 7(a) loan determinations for those borrowers who cannot obtain conventional credit at reasonable terms elsewhere. To monitor lender compliance with the “credit elsewhere” requirement SBA primarily uses on-site reviews conducted by third-party contractors with SBA participation and oversight, and other reviews. According to SBA guidance, lenders making 7(a) loans must take steps to ensure and document that borrowers meet the program's credit elsewhere requirement. However, GAO noted a number of concerns with SBA's monitoring efforts. Specifically, GAO found the following: Over 40 percent (17 of 40) of the on-site lender reviews performed in fiscal year 2016 identified lender noncompliance with the requirement. On-site reviewers identified several factors, such as weakness in lenders' internal control processes that were the cause for lender noncompliance. Most on-site reviewers did not document their assessment of lenders' policies or procedures, because SBA does not require them to do so. As a result SBA does not have information that could help explain the high noncompliance rate. Federal internal control standards state that management should design control activities, including appropriate documentation, and use quality information to achieve the entity's objectives. Without better information on lenders' procedures for complying with the documentation requirement, SBA may be limited in its ability to promote compliance with requirements designed to help ensure that the 7(a) program reaches its target population. SBA does not routinely collect or analyze information on the criteria used by lenders for credit elsewhere justifications. SBA recently began collecting some information on lenders' use of the criteria, but this information is limited, and SBA does not analyze the information that it does collect to better understand lenders' practices. Federal internal control standards state that management should use quality information to achieve the entity's objectives. Without more robust information and analysis, SBA may be limited in its ability to understand how lenders are using the credit elsewhere criteria and identify patterns of use by certain lenders that place them at a higher risk of not reaching borrowers who cannot obtain credit from other sources at reasonable terms. In general, representatives from 8 of 11 lenders that GAO interviewed stated that SBA's credit elsewhere criteria are adequate for determining small business eligibility for the 7(a) program. These criteria help them target their lending to small businesses that would otherwise have difficulty obtaining conventional credit because they are often new businesses or have a shortage of collateral. However, they also said that other factors—such as lender policies and economic conditions—can affect their decisions to offer 7(a) loans. In January 2018, SBA issued revised guidance for the 7(a) program and has provided training on this new guidance to lenders and trade associations. Lenders told GAO they are still in the process of understanding the new requirements. GAO recommends that SBA (1) require its on-site reviewers to document their assessment of lenders' policies and procedures related to the credit elsewhere documentation requirement, (2) collect information on lenders' use of credit elsewhere criteria, and (3) analyze that information to identify trends. SBA generally agreed with the recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8215}
{"pred": " The report discusses the implementation and effectiveness of the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) and its modernization, the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA), in improving federal performance management. Initially enacted in 1993, GPRA aimed to shift federal agencies' focus from processes to results by requiring the development of long-term and annual goals, along with performance measurement and reporting. While GPRA laid a foundation for results-oriented management, the report highlights that the use of performance information by managers has not significantly improved over time, with some agencies showing declines. GPRAMA, enacted in 2010, aimed to enhance the use of performance data through quarterly reviews and prioritizing goals. Despite these efforts, the report notes that the use of performance information remains limited, with only a small subset of managers reporting its effective use. The President’s Management Agenda (PMA) and related cross-agency priority (CAP) goals, such as leveraging data as a strategic asset, aim to address these issues. However, the report finds that while some agencies have made progress, overall use of performance information has not improved significantly, and challenges persist in integrating data-driven decision-making across all levels of the federal government. The report recommends that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Performance Improvement Council (PIC) identify and share proven practices to enhance the use of performance information and address barriers to its implementation. The findings underscore the need for continued efforts to improve the use of performance data in federal decision-making processes.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report. Let me start by understanding the main points. The report is about the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) and its modernization, GPRAMA. The goal was to make federal agencies focus more on results rather than just processes. They required agencies to set goals and measure progress. \n\nThe report mentions that even though GPRA was implemented, the use of performance information by managers hasn't improved much. There were some improvements in the number of performance measures, but actual use for decision-making remained low. Then GPRAMA came in 2010, which added things like quarterly reviews and prioritizing goals. But even with that, the report says that the use of performance data is still limited. \n\nThey also talk about the President's Management Agenda (PMA) and CAP goals, like leveraging data as a strategic asset. These are supposed to help with data-driven decisions, but the report found that", "answers": ["To reform the federal government and make it more efficient and effective, agencies need to use data about program performance. The benefit of collecting performance information is only fully realized when it is used by managers to make decisions aimed at improving results. GAO was asked to review agencies' use of performance information. This report assesses, among other things, the extent to which: (1) 24 agencies' reported use of performance information and related leading practices has changed since 2013 and (2) the Executive Branch has taken actions to enhance the use of performance information. To address the first objective, GAO analyzed results from its 2017 survey of federal managers, and compared them to 2013 results. The survey covered a stratified random sample of 4,395 managers from the 24 Chief Financial Officers Act agencies. The survey had a 67 percent response rate and results can be generalized to the population of managers government-wide and at each agency. For the second objective, GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed staff from OMB and the PIC. Agencies' reported use of performance information to make decisions, and leading practices that can promote such use, generally has not improved since GAO's last survey of federal managers in 2013. However, GAO's survey results continue to point to certain practices that could help agencies improve managers' use of performance information. For example, as shown in the table below, GAO's survey found that managers whose programs were subject to data-driven reviews (regular reviews used to assess progress on select agency goals) to a greater extent reported statistically significantly greater use of performance information to make decisions. The Executive Branch has begun taking steps to improve the use of performance information within agencies and across the government. For example, In the President's Management Agenda and government-wide reform plan, released in March and June 2018 respectively, the administration acknowledged the need to do more, and announced a goal, among other actions, to improve the use of data in federal decision making. However, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and others responsible for this goal have yet to fully develop action plans to hold agencies accountable for achieving it. The Performance Improvement Council (PIC), which is chaired by OMB, has undertaken efforts to improve the use of performance information by, for example, creating a working group on agency performance reviews. But it has not yet taken a systematic approach to identify and share proven practices that led to, or challenges that may be hampering, increased use of performance information by managers. GAO's survey results identified agencies that may have insights into such practices and challenges. More fully developing action plans for the new goal, and identifying and sharing proven practices and challenges, could help ensure the Executive Branch takes further steps to improve the use of performance information by managers within agencies and across the federal government. To improve the use of performance information within agencies and across the federal government, GAO recommends that OMB work with (1) fellow goal leaders to more fully develop action plans for the new goal to improve the use of data and (2) the PIC to prioritize efforts to identify and share proven practices and challenges.

GAO was asked to examine the effects of telework on agencies' space-planning efforts. In this report, GAO reviewed: (1) how the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies reported using telework in office space planning; (2) the specific ways selected agencies and GSA used telework in their office space planning; and (3) any challenges the civilian CFO Act agencies faced in using telework in office space planning. GAO surveyed all 23 civilian CFO Act agencies, analyzed each agency's space-planning documents, and Real Property Efficiency Plans . GAO reviewed four agencies in greater detail based on analysis of telework data and other factors. For those four agencies GAO conducted site visits, interviewed officials, and analyzed agency documents. GAO also identified challenges agencies faced in using telework in space planning, based on survey results, agency documents, and interviews. The 23 civilian Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act agencies reported various ways of considering and using telework as a space-planning tool, by, for example, implementing desk-sharing for employees who telework in order to relinquish leased space, or increasing the number of staff working in an existing space without increasing its size. All of the 23 agencies discussed telework in the context of space planning and achieving greater space efficiencies in either their space-planning documents or Real Property Efficiency Plans . The agencies that used telework as a space-planning tool generally reported implementing smaller or unassigned workstations. Three of the four agencies GAO reviewed in greater detail––the General Services Administration (GSA); the Office of Justice Programs at the Department of Justice; the Centers for Disease Control at the Department of Health and Human Services; and the Bureau of the Fiscal Service at the Department of the Treasury––leveraged telework to reduce or use office space more efficiently. For example, GSA and the Office of Justice Programs used telework to accommodate more employees in a smaller office space as illustrated in figure 1 below. The Centers for Disease Control used telework to accommodate more employees in the same amount of space. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service reduced space without telework by reducing the size of individual workstations. The 23 civilian CFO Act agencies reported several challenges in using telework to reduce space including human capital issues, mission suitability, and measuring cost savings attributable to telework. About two-thirds of the agencies said they would find it helpful to have additional information, assistance, or resources in using telework as a space-planning tool. GSA provides guidance to improve space utilization. However, GAO found that GSA last developed relevant formal guidance in 2006. This information, and that on GSA's telework and space-planning websites, was neither specific nor detailed and therefore of limited assistance to agencies that would like to use telework as a space-planning tool. Additionally, GSA's space-planning tool—the Workplace Investment and Feasibility Tool, intended to help agencies quantify the benefits and costs of telework––remains under development after more than 4 years, and GSA officials have not decided whether to make the tool available to other federal agencies. As such, agencies reported that they lack adequate guidance to determine how best to reduce space or use it more efficiently, and how to assess the benefits and costs of using telework in space planning. GSA concurred with recommendations that GSA should: (1) develop guidance on how agencies can use telework as a strategic space-planning tool and make this guidance readily available and (2) complete and make the Workplace Investment and Feasibility Tool available to federal agencies for use in assessing the benefits and costs of telework."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6903}

It also discusses the need for a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, improved oversight, and the implementation of effective cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive data and critical infrastructure. The report notes that while some progress has been made, many recommendations from previous reports have not been fully implemented, leaving significant gaps in the nation's cybersecurity defenses. The report calls for urgent action to address these challenges, including strengthening the cybersecurity workforce, enhancing the security of federal systems, and improving the protection of personal identifiable information (PII).

The risks to these systems are increasing as security threats evolve and become more sophisticated. GAO first designated information security as a government-wide high-risk area in 1997. This was expanded to include protecting cyber critical infrastructure in 2003 and protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information in 2015. This report provides an update to the information security high-risk area. To do so, GAO identified the actions the federal government and other entities need to take to address cybersecurity challenges. GAO primarily reviewed prior work issued since the start of fiscal year 2016 related to privacy, critical federal functions, and cybersecurity incidents, among other areas. GAO also reviewed recent cybersecurity policy and strategy documents, as well as information security industry reports of recent cyberattacks and security breaches. GAO has identified four major cybersecurity challenges and 10 critical actions that the federal government and other entities need to take to address them. GAO continues to designate information security as a government-wide high-risk area due to increasing cyber-based threats and the persistent nature of security vulnerabilities.

However, the position has remained vacant since 2016, and the Deputy Under Secretary has been acting in the role. PLCY is responsible for leading, conducting, and coordinating departmentwide policy development and implementation, as well as strategic planning. It has four categories of policy efforts: statutory responsibilities, interagency efforts, Secretary’s priorities, and self-initiated activities. Despite these responsibilities, PLCY faces challenges due to ambiguous roles, lack of clear procedures, and insufficient staffing. The report highlights that PLCY has not systematically applied workforce planning principles, leading to gaps in capacity and resource allocation. Recommendations include finalizing a delegation of authority, establishing processes for strategy development, using workforce planning tools, and enhancing communication with stakeholders.

PLCY supports cohesiveness by, among other things, coordinating departmentwide policy and strategy. In the past, however, questions have been raised about PLCY's efficacy. In December 2016, the NDAA codified PLCY's organizational structure, roles, and responsibilities. GAO was asked to evaluate PLCY's effectiveness. This report addresses the extent to which (1) DHS established an organizational structure and processes and procedures that position PLCY to be effective, (2) DHS and PLCY have ensured alignment of workforce with priorities, and (3) PLCY has engaged relevant component staff to help identify and respond to emerging needs. GAO analyzed the NDAA, documents describing specific responsibilities, and departmentwide policies and strategies. GAO also interviewed officials in PLCY and all eight operational components. According to our analysis and interviews with operational components, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans' (PLCY) organizational structure and efforts to lead and coordinate departmentwide and crosscutting strategies—a key organizational objective–have been effective. For example, PLCY's coordination efforts for a strategy and policy executive steering committee have been successful, particularly for strategies. However, PLCY has encountered challenges leading and coordinating efforts to develop, update, or harmonize policies that affect multiple DHS components. In large part, these challenges are because DHS does not have clearly-defined roles and responsibilities with accompanying processes and procedures to help PLCY lead and coordinate policy in a predictable, repeatable, and accountable manner. Until PLCY's roles and responsibilities for policy are more clearly defined and corresponding processes and procedures are in place, situations where the lack of clarity hampers PLCY's effectiveness in driving policy are likely to continue. Development of a delegation of authority, which involves reaching agreement about PLCY's roles and responsibilities and clearly documenting them, had been underway. However, it stalled due to changes in department leadership. As of May 2018, the effort had been revived, but it is not clear whether and when DHS will finalize it. PLCY does some workforce planning as part of its annual budgeting process, but does not systematically apply key principles of the DHS Workforce Planning Guide to help ensure that PLCY's workforce aligns with its and DHS's priorities and goals. According to PLCY officials, the nature of its mission requires a flexible staffing approach. As such, a portion of the staff functions as generalists who can be assigned to meet the needs of different situations, including unexpected changing priorities due to an emerging need. However, shifting short-term priorities requires tradeoffs, which may divert attention and resources from longer-term priorities. As of June 5, 2018, PLCY also had a number of vacancies in key leadership positions, which further limited attention to certain priorities. According to PLCY officials, PLCY recently began a review to identify the office's authorities in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (NDAA) and other statutes, compare these authorities to the current organization and operations, and address any workforce capacity gaps. Employing workforce planning principles—in particular, systematic identification of workforce demand, capacity gaps, and strategies to address them—consistent with the DHS Workforce Planning Guide could better position PLCY to use its workforce as effectively as possible under uncertain conditions and to communicate effectively with DHS leadership about tradeoffs. Officials from PLCY and DHS operational components praised existing mechanisms to coordinate and communicate at the senior level, especially about strategy, but component officials identified opportunities to better connect PLCY and component staff to improve communication flow about emerging policy and strategy needs. Among the ideas offered by component officials to enhance communication and collaboration were holding routine small-group meetings, creating forums for periodic knowledge sharing, and maintaining accurate and up-to-date contact information for all staff-level stakeholders. GAO is making four recommendations. DHS concurred with three recommendations, including that DHS finalize a delegation of authority defining PLCY's roles and responsibilities and develop corresponding processes and procedures.

When a state, U.S. territory, or tribe requests IA assistance through a federal disaster declaration, FEMA evaluates the request against regulatory factors, such as concentration of damages, and provides a recommendation to the President, who makes a final declaration decision. GAO was asked to review FEMA's IA declaration process. This report examines (1) the number of IA declaration requests received, declared, and denied, and IA actual obligations from calendar years 2008 through 2016, (2) the extent to which FEMA accounts for the regulatory factors when evaluating IA requests, and (3) any challenges FEMA regions and select states reported on the declaration process and factors and any FEMA actions to revise them. GAO reviewed FEMA's policies, IA declaration requests and obligation data, and FEMA's RVARs from July 2012 through December 2016, the most recent years for which data were available. GAO also reviewed proposed rulemaking comments and interviewed FEMA officials from all 10 regions and 11 state emergency management offices selected based on declaration requests and other factors. From calendar years 2008 through 2016, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Federal Emergency and Management Agency (FEMA) received 294 Individual Assistance (IA) declaration requests from states, U.S. territories, and tribes to help individuals meet their immediate needs after a disaster. Of these, the President declared 168 and denied 126 requests. Across the various types of IA declaration requests, severe storms (190) were the most common disaster type and drought (1) was among the least common. FEMA obligated about $8.6 billion in IA for disaster declarations during this period. GAO found that FEMA regions did not consistently obtain and document information on all elements of established IA regulatory factors when making IA recommendations to headquarters. Following a declaration request, a FEMA region is to prepare a Regional Administrator's Validation and Recommendation (RVAR)—a document designed to include data on each of the six IA regulatory factors for each declaration request as well as the regional administrator's recommendation. GAO reviewed all 81 RVARs from July 2012—the date FEMA began using the new RVAR template—through December 2016. GAO found that regions did not consistently obtain and document information for the elements required under the six regulatory factors (see table). For example, only 44 of the 81 RVARs documented all elements under the concentration of damage factor. By evaluating why regions are not completing all elements of each current IA regulatory factor, FEMA could identify whether any corrective steps are needed. Officials from the 10 FEMA regions and 11 states GAO interviewed, reported positive relationships with each other, but also cited various challenges with the IA declaration process and regulatory factors. For example, these officials told GAO that there are no established minimum thresholds for IA, making final determinations more subjective and the rationale behind denials unclear. However, as required by the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, FEMA has taken steps to revise the IA factors by issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking. According to FEMA, the proposed rule aims to provide more objective criteria, clarify the threshold for eligibility, and speed up the IA declaration process. As of April 2018, the proposed rule was still under consideration. According to FEMA officials, they plan to finalize the rule in late 2018; therefore, it is too early to know the extent to which it will address these challenges.

The report highlights several critical deficiencies in the Forest Service’s processes and control activities, including inadequate procedures for ensuring that appropriated funds are used for their designated purposes, insufficient oversight of unobligated no-year funds, and a lack of a comprehensive system for administrative control of funds. These issues increase the risk of misusing funds, noncompliance with legal requirements, and inefficiencies in program operations. The report also identifies problems with the management of reimbursable agreements, such as fire incident cooperative agreements and reimbursable and advanced collection agreements (RACAs), including inadequate documentation, lack of segregation of duties, and insufficient review processes. Additionally, the Forest Service’s processes for reviewing unliquidated obligations were found to be inconsistent with USDA and Forest Service policies, leading to potential delays and improper deobligation of funds. The report recommends that the Forest Service revise its processes, design and implement control activities, and ensure that its manuals and handbooks are regularly updated to align with current policies and procedures. The Forest Service has acknowledged the findings and stated that it has made progress in addressing the issues, including revising financial policies and modifying the certification process for unliquidated obligations.

The main issues they found are:\n\n1. **Budget Execution Issues**: The Forest Service didn't have proper processes to ensure funds were used for their intended purposes. For example, they didn't set aside specific funds for certain programs like the airtanker fleet, leading to misuse of money. They also didn't review unobligated funds from previous years, risking over-spending or missing opportunities to reallocate funds.\n\n2. **Administrative Control of Funds**: There was no comprehensive system in place to manage funds, leading to risks of non-compliance with laws like the Antideficiency Act.

Its budget execution process for carrying out its mission includes (1) allotments, which are authorizations by an agency to incur obligations within a specified amount, and (2) unliquidated obligations, which represent budgetary resources that have been committed but not yet paid. Deobligation refers to an agency's cancellation or downward adjustments of previously incurred obligations, which may result in funds that may be available for reobligation. GAO was asked to review the Forest Service's internal controls over its budget execution processes. This report examines the extent to which the Forest Service properly designed control activities over (1) allotments of budgetary resources, its system for administrative control of funds, and any fund transfers between Forest Service appropriations; (2) reimbursables and related collections; and (3) review and certification of unliquidated obligations. GAO reviewed the Forest Service's policies, procedures, and other documentation and interviewed agency officials. In fiscal years 2015 and 2016, the Forest Service received discretionary no-year appropriations of $5.1 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively. It is critical for the Forest Service to manage its budgetary resources efficiently and effectively. While the Forest Service had processes over certain of its budget execution activities, GAO found the following internal control deficiencies: Budgetary resources . The purpose statute requires that amounts designated in appropriations acts for specific purposes are used as designated. The Forest Service did not have an adequate process and related control activities to reasonably assure that amounts were used as designated. In fiscal year 2017, GAO issued a legal opinion that the Forest Service had failed to comply with the purpose statute with regard to a $65 million line-item appropriation specifically provided for the purpose of acquiring aircraft for the next-generation airtanker fleet. Further, the Forest Service lacked a process and related control activities to reasonably assure that unobligated no-year appropriation balances from prior years were reviewed for their continuing need; did not have a properly designed system for administrative control of funds, which keeps obligations and expenditures from exceeding limits authorized by law; and had not properly designed control activities for fund transfers to its Wildland Fire Management program. These deficiencies increase the risk that the Forest Service may make budget requests in excess of its needs. Reimbursable agreements . To carry out its mission, the Forest Service enters into reimbursable agreements with agencies within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), other federal agencies, state and local government agencies, and nongovernment entities. The Forest Service (1) did not have adequately described processes and related control activities in manuals and handbooks for its reimbursable agreement processes and (2) lacked control activities related to segregating incompatible duties performed by line officers and program managers. For example, line officers may be responsible for initiating cost sharing agreements, modifying cost settlement packages, and changing or canceling the related receivable, which represent incompatible duties. As a result, programs and resources may not be protected from waste, fraud, and mismanagement. Unliquidated obligations . The Forest Service's processes and control activities over the review and certification of unliquidated obligations were not properly designed to reasonably assure the best use of funds and that unliquidated obligations would be efficiently and effectively deobligated and made available for other program needs. Further, the current process, as designed, was inconsistent with USDA and Forest Service policy. In addition, the Forest Service's manuals and handbooks, which provide directives for the areas that GAO reviewed, had not been reviewed by management in accordance with the Forest Service's 5-year review policy. Further, standard operating procedures and desk guides prepared by staff to supplement the manuals and handbooks were not issued as directives and therefore were not considered official policy. This increases the risk that control activities may not be consistently performed across the agency. GAO is making 11 recommendations to improve processes and related internal control activities over the management of the Forest Service's budgetary resources, reimbursable receivables and collections, and its process for reviewing unliquidated obligations.

{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is about the Senate confirmation process for presidential nominations. \n\nFirst, the report explains that the Constitution requires the Senate's advice and consent for presidential appointments. The confirmation process serves several purposes: examining qualifications, influencing policy, and sometimes delaying to gain leverage. The Senate confirms a high percentage of nominations because most are routine, especially military and civilian positions like Foreign Service roles. \n\nThe report mentions that the Senate can't review all nominations in detail, so a regularized process is necessary. They often approve en bloc, especially for military appointments. High-level positions get more scrutiny, like Supreme Court nominees, and judicial nominations are more scrutinized due to lifetime tenure. \n\nThere are reasons for high confirmation rates: most positions aren't policymaking, and there's a tradition that the President has wide latitude in selecting Cabinet members. Senators are often involved in the nomination stage, and the President might consult with them. Senatorial courtesy allows home-state senators to block nominations for certain roles. \n\nThe report also discusses changes since 2011, like the Executive Calendar and referral processes. Nominations are referred to committees, which have their own rules. Committees may hold hearings, gather information, and sometimes use FBI reports. Financial disclosures are reviewed, and committees can request additional info. \n\nThe process includes hearings where nominees testify, and the Senate can approve, reject, or take no action. The cloture process allows ending debate, with recent changes lowering the threshold for cloture. Holds are used to delay nominations, but cloture is easier now. The report ends with the impact of recent rule changes on the confirmation process, like reducing post-cloture time.\n\nNow, I need to condense all this into a one-page summary. I should start with the constitutional basis, the purpose of the confirmation process, the types of nominations, the role of committees, the steps involved, the reasons for high confirmation rates, recent changes, and the impact of cloture and holds. I need to make sure it's concise, double-spaced, and covers all key points without getting too detailed. Let me structure it with clear sections and keep each paragraph focused. Also, check for any important statistics or examples, like the 65,000 military appointments, the 2,000 civilian", "answers": ["Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution provides that the President shall appoint officers of the United States \"by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate.\" This report describes the process by which the Senate provides advice and consent on presidential nominations, including receipt and referral of nominations, committee practices, and floor procedure. Committees play the central role in the process through investigations and hearings. Senate Rule XXXI provides that nominations shall be referred to appropriate committees \"unless otherwise ordered.\" Most nominations are referred, although a Senate standing order provides that some \"privileged\" nominations to specified positions will not be referred unless requested by a Senator. The Senate rule concerning committee jurisdictions (Rule XXV) broadly defines issue areas for committees, and the same jurisdictional statements generally apply to nominations as well as legislation. A committee often gathers information about a nominee either before or instead of a formal hearing. A committee considering a nomination has four options. It can report the nomination to the Senate favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation, or it can choose to take no action. It is more common for a committee to take no action on a nomination than to reject a nominee outright. The Senate handles executive business, which includes both nominations and treaties, separately from its legislative business. All nominations reported from committee are listed on the Executive Calendar, a separate document from the Calendar of Business, which lists pending bills and resolutions. Generally speaking, the majority leader schedules floor consideration of nominations on the Calendar. Nominations are considered in \"executive session,\" a parliamentary form of the Senate in session that has its own journal and, to some extent, its own rules of procedure. The Senate can call up a nomination expeditiously, because a motion to enter executive session to consider a specific nomination on the Calendar is not debatable. This motion requires a majority of Senators present and voting, a quorum being present, for approval. After a nomination has been called up, the question before the Senate is \"will the Senate advise and consent to this nomination?\" A majority of Senators voting is required to approve a nomination. However, Senate rules place no limit on how long a nomination may be debated, and ending consideration could require invoking cloture. On April 6, 2017, the Senate reinterpreted Rule XXII in order to allow cloture to be invoked on nominations to the Supreme Court by a majority of Senators voting. This expanded the results of similar actions taken by the Senate in November 2013, which changed the cloture vote requirement to a majority for nominations other than to the Supreme Court. After the 2013 decision, the number of nominations subjected to a cloture process increased. On April 3, 2019, the Senate reinterpreted Rule XXII again. The Senate reduced, from 30 hours to 2 hours, the maximum time nominations can be considered after cloture has been invoked. This change applied to all executive branch nominations except to high-level positions such as heads of departments, and it applied to all judicial nominations except to the Supreme Court and the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The full impact of this change is difficult to assess at this time, but it is likely to shorten the time between a cloture vote and a vote on the nomination. If Senators respond as they did to the last reinterpretation of the cloture rule, it might also increase the number of nominations subjected to a cloture process. Nominations that are pending when the Senate adjourns sine die at the end of a session or recesses for more than 30 days are returned to the President unless the Senate, by unanimous consent, waives the rule requiring their return (Senate Rule XXXI, clause 6). If a nomination is returned, and the President still desires Senate consideration, he must submit a new nomination."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5595}

It's administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), but benefits are usually paid by private insurers or self-insured companies. The report mentions that the LHWCA covers workers on navigable waters and adjacent areas like piers and dry docks. It also lists excluded workers, like those in clerical roles or certain recreational vessel workers. There's a part about the 2009 amendment that changed the definition of recreational vessels, which affects coverage. \n\nThe report also talks about the history of the LHWCA, including its creation in 1927 and subsequent amendments expanding coverage to other workers. The financial aspects are important too: benefits are paid from the Special Fund or through insurance, and administrative costs are covered by general revenue. The benefits include medical, disability, and survivors' benefits, with specific details on how they're calculated. The claims process involves the DOL, and there's a dispute resolution system with administrative law judges and the Benefits Review Board.\n\nI need to condense all this into a concise summary.

The LHWCA is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), and all benefit costs are paid by employers and their insurance carriers. In 2016, more than $1.4 billion in LHWCA benefits were paid to beneficiaries. Congress has extended the LHWCA provisions to cover workers outside of the maritime industry, such as overseas government contractors and civilian employees of military post exchanges. As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), persons who repair recreational vessels of any size were added to the LHWCA exemption list. In 2011, the DOL implemented this provision; since then, those regulations have proven controversial and numerous bills have been introduced to modify the regulatory definition to increase the number of workers exempted from the LHWCA.

Introduction: Overview of", "answers": ["This report provides an overview and analysis of FY2019 appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The primary focus of this report is on congressional direction and funding provided to DHS through the appropriations process. It includes an Appendix with definitions of key budget terms used throughout the suite of Congressional Research Service reports on homeland security appropriations. It also directs the reader to other reports providing context for specific component appropriations. As part of an overall DHS budget that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimated to be $74.88 billion, the Trump Administration requested $47.43 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority through the appropriations process for DHS for FY2018. The request amounted to a $0.29 billion (0.6%) decrease from the $47.72 billion in annual appropriations enacted for FY2018 through the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141, Division F). The Administration also requested discretionary funding for DHS components that does not count against discretionary spending limits and is not reflected in the adjusted net discretionary budget authority total. The Administration requested an additional $6.65 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in disaster relief funding, as defined by the Budget Control Act (P.L. 112-25; BCA), and in the budget request for the Department of Defense (DOD), $165 million in Overseas Contingency Operations designated funding (OCO) from the Operations and Maintenance budget of the U.S. Navy. On June 21, 2018, the Senate Committee on Appropriations reported out S. 3109, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019, accompanied by S.Rept. 115-283. Committee-reported S. 3109 included $48.33 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for FY2019. This was $901 million (1.9%) above the level requested by the Administration, and $611 million (1.3%) above the enacted level for FY2018. The Senate committee-reported bill included the Administration-requested levels for disaster relief funding, and included the OCO funding in an appropriation to the Coast Guard, rather than as a transfer from the U.S. Navy. On July 26, 2018, the House Appropriations Committee marked up H.R. 6776, its version of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019. H.Rept. 115-948 was filed September 12, 2018. Committee-reported H.R. 6776 included $51.44 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority. The House committee-reported bill included the Administration-requested levels for disaster relief funding, but unlike S. 3109, did not include the OCO funding for the Coast Guard. As some of the annual appropriations for FY2019 remained unfinished, a consolidated appropriations bill that included a continuing resolution was passed by Congress and signed into law on September 28, 2018. The resolution, which covered DHS along with several other departments and agencies, continued funding at a rate of operations equal to FY2018 with some exceptions. This continuing resolution was extended through December 21, 2018, after which point annual appropriations lapsed. A partial government shutdown ensued for 35 days until continuing appropriations were resumed January 25, 2019, by P.L. 116-5. P.L. 116-6, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, was passed by Congress on February 14, 2019, and signed into law the following day. Division A of the act included the Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019, which included $49.41 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, $12 billion designated for the costs of major disasters, and $165 million in OCO funding for the Coast Guard.

{"pred": " The report examines the legal and constitutional framework surrounding \"affirmative action\" in higher education, focusing on two distinct interpretations: (1) the mandatory use of race-conscious policies to dismantle the remnants of de jure segregation in public universities, and (2) the voluntary consideration of race in admissions to promote diversity. The Supreme Court's analysis under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause has shaped both lines of doctrine. In the de jure context, the Court has required states to eliminate vestiges of past segregation, as established in *United States v. Fordice*, which outlined a three-step test to assess whether a state has fulfilled its obligation to dismantle segregated systems. This includes evaluating whether policies are traceable to segregation, have discriminatory effects, and can be practically eliminated. In the voluntary context, the Court has applied strict scrutiny to race-conscious admissions policies, upholding them only if they are narrowly tailored to serve compelling educational interests, such as fostering diversity. The Court has emphasized that universities must articulate precise diversity goals and demonstrate that their policies achieve these goals without treating applicants as mere racial categories. The report also highlights the role of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act in enforcing anti-discrimination mandates, including the potential for congressional action to expand or limit the scope of race-conscious measures. The ongoing legal and political debates reflect the tension between the Court's strict scrutiny and the practical need for diversity in higher education, with the Court's decisions in *Grutter v. Bollinger* and *Fisher v. University of Texas* establishing that diversity is a compelling interest, but only when implemented through flexible, individualized admissions processes. The report concludes that while the Court has allowed race-conscious policies under strict scrutiny, the legal landscape remains complex and subject to further judicial and legislative developments.\nThe report explores the legal and constitutional framework of \"affirmative action\" in higher education, focusing on two distinct interpretations: (1) the mandatory use of race-conscious policies to dismantle the remnants of de jure segregation in public universities, and (2) the voluntary consideration of race in admissions to promote diversity.

Because state-sanctioned race segregation in public education violates the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, in certain cases involving a state's formerly de jure segregated public university system, a state's consideration of race in its higher education policies and practices may be an affirmative obligation. As the U.S. Supreme Court explained in its consequential 1992 decision United States v. Fordice, equal protection may require states that formerly maintained de jure segregated university systems to consider race for the purpose of eliminating all vestiges of their prior \"dual\" systems. Drawing upon its precedent addressing racially segregated public schools in the K-12 context, the Court established a three-part legal standard in Fordice for evaluating the sufficiency and effectiveness of a state's efforts in \"dismantl[ing]\" its formerly de jure segregated public university system. To that remedial end, mandatory race-conscious measures—in this de jure context—are not limited to admissions. Instead, remedies may also address policies and practices relating to academic programs, institutional missions, funding, and other aspects of public university operations. Outside this de jure context, \"affirmative action\" has come to refer to a different category of race-conscious policies. These involve what the Court at one time called the \"benign\" use of racial classifications—voluntary measures designed not to remedy past de jure discrimination, but to help racial minorities overcome the effects of their earlier exclusion. And for institutions of higher education, the Court has addressed one type of affirmative action policy in particular: the use of race as a factor in admissions decisions, a practice now widely observed by both public and private colleges and universities. The federal courts have come to subject these voluntary race-conscious policies—\"affirmative action\" in its perhaps more familiar sense—to a particularly searching form of review known as strict scrutiny. And even though this heightened judicial scrutiny has long been regarded as strict in theory but fatal in fact, the Court's review of race-conscious admissions policies in higher education has proved a notable exception, with the Court having twice upheld universities' use of race as one of many factors considered when assembling their incoming classes. The Court has long grappled with this seeming tension—between the strictness of its scrutiny and its approval of race-conscious admissions policies—beginning with its landmark 1978 decision in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke through its 2016 decision in Fisher v. University of Texas. Though the Equal Protection Clause generally concerns public universities and their constitutional obligations under the Fourteenth Amendment, federal statutory law also plays a role in ensuring equal protection in higher education. To that end, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits recipients of federal funding—including private colleges and universities—from, at a minimum, discriminating against students and applicants in a manner that would violate the Equal Protection Clause.

{"pred": " The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), authorizes the State Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) program to support employment and independent living for individuals with disabilities. This program, funded by the U.S. Department of Education’s Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA), provides services to help individuals with disabilities prepare for and achieve employment. Under WIOA, states must reserve 15% of their VR funds for pre-employment transition services (PETS) for students with disabilities, which include activities like work-based learning, self-advocacy training, and job exploration counseling. While most state VR agencies have expanded services for students with disabilities since WIOA’s enactment, challenges remain in identifying eligible students, using reserved funds effectively, and coordinating with educational agencies. Many states have not fully utilized the reserved funds or updated interagency agreements with educational agencies to ensure seamless collaboration. Additionally, there is a lack of clarity on allowable expenditures for PETS, leading to confusion among state agencies. Education has provided guidance and technical assistance through centers like WINTAC and NTACT, but more detailed information and timely updates are needed to help states navigate these requirements. The report recommends that the Secretary of Education establish clear timeframes for providing additional guidance on allowable expenditures, take steps to assist states in updating interagency agreements, and develop a plan to identify and disseminate best practices for implementing PETS. These actions would help improve the coordination and effectiveness of services for students with disabilities transitioning from school to work.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report.

The VR program helps people with disabilities get employment, and under WIOA, there's a focus on pre-employment transition services (PETS) for students with disabilities. \n\nFirst, I should outline the key components of the program. The VR program is funded by the federal government, with states contributing a 21.3% match. The report mentions that WIOA requires states to reserve 15% of their VR funds for PETS, which include activities like work-based learning and self-advocacy training. \n\nNext, the report discusses how states have implemented these services.

GAO was asked to review how states were implementing these services. This report examines (1) steps states reported taking to implement pre-employment transition services, and (2) implementation challenges states reported and how Education has addressed them. GAO reviewed documents and funding data from Education, and federal laws and regulations; surveyed all 79 state VR agencies (74 responded); held discussion groups with representatives of 29 state VR agencies; and interviewed officials from Education and three states (Idaho, Illinois, and Maryland) GAO selected for variety in size and type of agencies, among other factors. Of the 74 state vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies that responded to GAO's survey, most reported expanding services to help students with disabilities transition from school to work as required under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), enacted in July 2014. Most state agencies reported serving more students and providing work-based learning experiences and other activities, referred to as pre-employment transition services (see figure). State VR agencies reported two key challenges with implementing pre-employment transition services for students as required by WIOA. Spending reserved funds : States reported spending about $357 million out of the $465 million reserved for these services in fiscal year 2016. Education officials said that states had difficulty determining what expenditures were allowable, and some state officials said they would like more detailed information from Education. Education officials said they plan to clarify guidance but have no timeframe for providing further information, which would help states to better plan their use of reserved funds. Finalizing interagency agreements : Fewer than half the state VR agencies that responded to GAO's survey (34 of 74) reported updating their interagency agreement with their state's educational agency. Interagency agreements can help promote collaboration by, for example, establishing roles and responsibilities of each agency. Although Education offers technical assistance on interagency agreements, without increased efforts to raise awareness about the importance of these agreements and provide assistance to states where needed, Education may miss opportunities to help state VR and educational agencies efficiently and effectively coordinate services. In addition, WIOA requires Education to highlight best state practices, and most VR agencies responding to GAO's survey (63 of 74) reported this would be useful. Education does not have a written plan or timeframe for identifying and disseminating best practices. As a result, Education may miss opportunities to help more students with disabilities successfully transition from school to work. GAO is recommending that Education (1) establish timeframes for providing additional information on allowable expenditures, (2) take additional steps to assist states that have not updated and finalized their interagency agreements, and (3) develop a written plan with specific timeframes and activities for identifying and disseminating best practices.

{"pred": " Medicare is a federal health insurance program established in 1965 under the Social Security Act to provide coverage for individuals aged 65 and older, as well as those with disabilities. Administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the program consists of four parts: Part A (Hospital Insurance) covers inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing care, hospice, and some home health services; Part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) covers physician services, outpatient care, and preventive services; Part C (Medicare Advantage) offers private plan alternatives for Parts A and B; and Part D covers outpatient prescription drugs. Medicare is funded through a combination of payroll taxes, beneficiary premiums, general revenues, and state transfers. In 2019, the program served approximately 61 million beneficiaries, with total spending estimated at $772 billion, of which $749 billion was for benefits. Medicare is considered mandatory spending, not subject to the appropriations process, and is a significant portion of the federal budget. The program faces financial challenges, with the Hospital Insurance (HI) trust fund projected to become insolvent by 2026. Medicare has undergone numerous reforms over the years, including changes to payment systems, the introduction of managed care options, and the expansion of prescription drug coverage.

Part A is funded by payroll taxes, while Part B and D use premiums and general funds. The HI trust fund is projected to be insolvent by 2026. There's a lot of historical context", "answers": ["Medicare is a federal program that pays for covered health care services of qualified beneficiaries. It was established in 1965 under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide health insurance to individuals 65 and older, and has been expanded over the years to include permanently disabled individuals under the age of 65. Medicare, which consists of four parts (A-D), covers hospitalizations, physician services, prescription drugs, skilled nursing facility care, home health visits, and hospice care, among other services. Generally, individuals are eligible for Medicare if they or their spouse worked for at least 40 quarters in Medicare-covered employment, are 65 years old, and are a citizen or permanent resident of the United States. Individuals may also qualify for coverage if they are a younger person who cannot work because they have a medical condition that is expected to last at least one year or result in death, or have end-stage renal disease (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplant). The program is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and by private entities that contract with CMS to provide claims processing, auditing, and quality oversight services. In FY2019, the program is expected to cover approximately 61 million persons (52 million aged and 9 million disabled) at a total cost of about $772 billion. Spending under the program (except for a portion of administrative costs) is considered mandatory spending and is not subject to the annual appropriations process. Services provided under Parts A and B (also referred to as \"original\" or \"traditional\" Medicare) are generally paid directly by the government on a \"fee-for-service\" basis, using different prospective payment systems or fee schedules. Under Parts C and D, private insurers are paid a monthly \"capitated\" amount to provide enrollees with required benefits. Medicare is required to pay for all covered services provided to eligible persons, so long as specific criteria are met. Since 1965, the Medicare program has undergone considerable change. For example, during the 111th Congress, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148 and P.L. 111-152) made numerous changes to the Medicare program that modified provider reimbursements, provided incentives to increase the quality and efficiency of care, and enhanced certain Medicare benefits. In the 114th Congress, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA; P.L. 114-10) changed the method for calculating updates to Medicare payment rates to physicians and altered how physicians and other practitioners will be paid in the future. Projections of future Medicare expenditures and funding indicate that the program will place increasing financial demands on the federal budget and on beneficiaries. For example, the Hospital Insurance (Part A) trust fund is projected to become insolvent in 2026. Additionally, although the Supplementary Medical Insurance (Parts B and D) trust fund is financed in large part through federal general revenues and cannot become insolvent, associated spending growth is expected to put increasing strains on the country's competing spending priorities. As such, Medicare is expected to be a high-priority issue in the current Congress, and Congress may consider a variety of Medicare reform options ranging from further modifications of provider payment mechanisms to redesigning the entire program.

{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this detailed report on U.S. foreign aid. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points. \n\nThe report begins by explaining that U.S. foreign aid is the largest part of the international affairs budget and has evolved over time. It mentions that after 9/11, the focus shifted to include global development as a third pillar of national security. The Trump administration still values aid but doesn't explicitly mention it in their strategy. The report addresses common questions about the program's objectives, costs, organization, and how it compares to other donors.\n\nIt defines foreign aid broadly under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, including various forms like grants, loans, and technical assistance. The report notes that traditional aid accounts are now part of the 150 budget function, but nontraditional aid, like DOD programs, has grown. There's a mention of data discrepancies between traditional and nontraditional aid.\n\nThe report outlines three main rationales for foreign aid: national security, commercial interests, and humanitarian concerns. Objectives include economic growth, governance, health, and more. The State Department's 2006 framework organizes aid into five strategic objectives. \n\nIn FY2017, total aid was $49.9 billion, with bilateral development at $16.2 billion, multilateral at $2.1 billion, and humanitarian at $8.9 billion. The report details different types of aid, like military assistance ($14.5 billion), global health, and specific programs like PEPFAR. It also discusses how aid is implemented by agencies like USAID, DOD, and the State Department, and the role of Congress in authorizing and appropriating funds.\n\nThe report highlights the shift from traditional to nontraditional aid, the impact of events like 9/11, and the role of the OCO designation in funding. It also touches on tied aid, the U.S. position as a top donor, and the comparison with other countries. The summary needs to capture all these elements concisely.\n\nI need to structure the summary to cover the main points: definition and evolution of foreign aid, key rationales and objectives, funding and allocation, major agencies involved, the role of Congress, and comparisons with other donors. Also, mention the data from FY2017", "answers": ["Foreign assistance is the largest component of the international affairs budget and is viewed by many as an essential instrument of U.S. foreign policy. On the basis of national security, commercial, and humanitarian rationales, U.S. assistance flows through many federal agencies and supports myriad objectives. These include promoting economic growth, reducing poverty, improving governance, expanding access to health care and education, promoting stability in conflict regions, countering terrorism, promoting human rights, strengthening allies, and curbing illicit drug production and trafficking. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, foreign aid has increasingly been associated with national security policy. At the same time, many Americans and some Members of Congress view foreign aid as an expense that the United States cannot afford given current budget deficits. In FY2017, U.S. foreign assistance, defined broadly, totaled an estimated $49.87 billion, or 1.2% of total federal budget authority. About 44% of this assistance was for bilateral economic development programs, including political/strategic economic assistance; 35% for military aid and nonmilitary security assistance; 18% for humanitarian activities; and 4% to support the work of multilateral institutions. Assistance can take the form of cash transfers, equipment and commodities, infrastructure, or technical assistance, and, in recent decades, is provided almost exclusively on a grant rather than loan basis. Most U.S. aid is implemented by nongovernmental organizations rather than foreign governments. The United States is the largest foreign aid donor in the world, accounting for about 24% of total official development assistance from major donor governments in 2017 (the latest year for which these data are available). Key foreign assistance trends in the past decade include growth in development aid, particularly global health programs; increased security assistance directed toward U.S. allies in the anti-terrorism effort; and high levels of humanitarian assistance to address a range of crises. Adjusted for inflation, annual foreign assistance funding over the past decade was the highest it has been since the Marshall Plan in the years immediately following World War II. In FY2017, Afghanistan, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, and Egypt received the largest amounts of U.S. aid, reflecting long-standing aid commitments to Israel and Egypt, the strategic significance of Afghanistan and Iraq, and the strategic and humanitarian importance of Jordan as the crisis in neighboring Syria continues. The Near East region received 27% of aid allocated by country or region in FY2017, followed by Africa, at 25%, and South and Central Asia, at 15%. This was a significant shift from a decade prior, when Africa received 19% of aid and the Near East 34%, reflecting significant increases in HIV/AIDS-related programs concentrated in Africa between FY2007 and FY2017 and the drawdown of U.S. military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Military assistance to Iraq began to decline starting in FY2011, but growing concern about the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has reversed this trend.

It is intended to provide a broad view of foreign assistance over time, and will be updated periodically.

{"pred": " The National Popular Vote (NPV) initiative, established in 2006, aims to achieve direct popular election of the U.S. President and Vice President without a constitutional amendment. The initiative proposes an interstate compact where states agree to appoint electors pledged to the candidate who wins the national popular vote. This would ensure that the popular vote winner always becomes President, bypassing the current electoral college system. The electoral college, established by Article II of the Constitution and later modified by the Twelfth Amendment, allocates electors based on state representation in Congress, with each state having a number equal to its total congressional delegation. Critics argue that the system is undemocratic, as it allows less populous states to have disproportionate influence and can result in a candidate winning the presidency without a majority of the popular vote. Despite numerous attempts to reform the electoral college through constitutional amendments, none have succeeded due to the high threshold required by Article V, which mandates two-thirds approval by Congress and ratification by three-fourths of the states. The NPV initiative seeks to circumvent these requirements by leveraging the constitutional authority of states to appoint electors. As of May 2019, 14 states and the District of Columbia, representing 189 electoral votes, have joined the compact, but this is still short of the 270 needed for the compact to take effect. Supporters argue that the NPV would make every vote equal, increase campaign engagement in non-battleground states, and enhance democratic fairness. Opponents, however, contend that the compact is unconstitutional, violates the Founders' intentions, and could lead to legal challenges and increased election disputes. The initiative's legal status under the Compact Clause of the Constitution remains contentious, as it may require congressional approval. While the NPV has gained traction in Democratic-leaning states, its success depends on broader bipartisan support and the eventual ratification of the compact by enough states to meet the 270 electoral vote threshold.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this detailed report about the National Popular Vote (NPV) initiative. Let me start by understanding the key points from the report.\n\nFirst, the NPV was founded in 2006. Its goal is to achieve direct popular election of the President and Vice President without a constitutional amendment. They use an interstate compact where states agree to appoint electors based on the national popular vote. This would mean that the candidate with the most popular votes nationwide would win the presidency, even if they don't win the", "answers": ["The National Popular Vote (NPV) initiative proposes an agreement among the states, an interstate compact that would effectively achieve direct popular election of the President and Vice President without a constitutional amendment. It relies on the Constitution's grant of authority to the states in Article II, Section 1 to appoint presidential electors \"in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct.... \" Any state that joins the NPV compact pledges that if the compact comes into effect, its legislature will award all the state's electoral votes to the presidential ticket that wins the most popular votes nationwide, regardless of who wins in that particular state. The compact would, however, come into effect only if its success has been assured; that is, only if states controlling a majority of electoral votes (270 or more) join the compact. By early May 2019, 14 states and the District of Columbia had joined the compact. After early momentum—eight states and the District of Columbia joined the NPV Compact between 2007 and 2011—the pace of state accessions slowed through 2018. Since then, four additional states joined, bringing the total number of electoral votes controlled by NPV member states to 189. During the same period, legislation to join the compact had been introduced during the current session in at least one chamber of the legislature in 14 additional states that control an additional 150 electors. The NPV initiative emerged following the presidential election of 2000, in which one ticket gained an electoral vote majority, winning the presidency, but received fewer popular votes than its opponents. NPV grew out of subsequent discussions among scholars and activists about how to avoid similar outcomes in the future and to achieve direct popular election. Proponents of NPV assert that it would guarantee the presidential candidates who win the most popular votes nationwide will always win the presidency; that it would end the inequities of the general ticket/winner-take-all system of awarding electoral votes; and that candidates would extend their focus beyond winning the \"battleground states,\" campaigning more widely and devoting greater attention to issues of concern to other parts of the country. They further assert that NPV would accomplish this while avoiding the exacting standards set for the proposal and ratification of constitutional amendments. Opponents argue that NPV would undermine the authority of states under the Constitution and the Founders' intention that presidential elections should be both national and federal contests; that it is an admitted \"end run\" around the Constitution that would circumvent the amendment process; and that it might actually lead to more disputed presidential elections characterized by politically contentious state recounts. The NPV has also been debated on legal grounds. Some observers maintain that it must be approved by Congress, because it is an interstate compact that would affect key provisions of constitutional presidential election procedures. NPV Inc., the organization managing the initiative's advocacy campaign, responds that congressional approval is not necessary because NPV concerns the appointment of electors, a subject that falls within state constitutional authority, and that the Supreme Court has previously rejected arguments that similar compacts would impair the rights of nonmember states. Other critics claim that NPV might violate the Voting Rights Act by diluting minority voter influence and avoiding the recently invalidated preclearance requirement for election procedure changes in covered jurisdictions. In response, NPV Inc. has asserted that the compact is \"entirely consistent with the goal of the Voting Rights Act.\" This report monitors the NPV's progress in the states and will identify and analyze further developments as warranted."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10755}
{"pred": " \n\nThe federal government plans to invest over $96 billion in IT for fiscal year 2018, the largest budget ever. However, despite this significant investment, many federal IT projects have historically resulted in cost overruns, schedule delays, and limited mission outcomes. Examples include the failed National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, the Secure Border Initiative Network, and the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Financial and Logistics Integrated Technology Enterprise program. These failures often stem from poor project management, lack of oversight, and ineffective governance, particularly with CIOs having limited authority. \n\nSecurity deficiencies also pose risks to federal IT systems. Despite spending $4 billion on IT security in fiscal year 2016, agencies continue to face cybersecurity challenges. Notable issues include the Department of Education’s failure to analyze privacy risks, the Office of Personnel Management’s incomplete implementation of security recommendations, and the IRS’s weak information security program. \n\nTo address these issues, Congress and the President have enacted several reforms, including the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA), the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA), and the Modernizing Government Technology (MGT) Act. FITARA aims to enhance CIO authority, promote data center consolidation, and improve transparency. FISMA focuses on strengthening cybersecurity through risk-based programs and oversight. The MGT Act provides funding mechanisms for IT modernization and the Technology Modernization Fund. \n\nDespite these efforts, implementation remains inconsistent. Many agencies have not fully implemented FITARA’s requirements, such as CIO authority enhancements and data center consolidation. OMB guidance has been criticized for not comprehensively addressing CIO responsibilities, leading to gaps in IT management. Additionally, agencies often fail to identify and review all IT contracts, resulting in potential duplication and inefficiencies. \n\nSoftware license management and data center optimization also remain areas of concern. While OMB has developed policies to reduce commodity IT spending, many agencies lack comprehensive software license policies and have not met data center optimization targets. \n\nOverall, while the federal government has taken steps to improve IT management and cybersecurity, significant challenges remain. Continued implementation of reforms, stronger oversight, and improved agency coordination are essential to achieving more effective and secure federal IT systems.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to get the main points. \n\nThe report talks about the federal government's $96 billion IT budget for 2018, which is the largest ever. But despite that,", "answers": ["The federal government plans to invest almost $96 billion in IT in fiscal year 2018. Historically, IT investments have too often failed or contributed little to mission-related outcomes. Further, increasingly sophisticated threats and frequent cyber incidents underscore the need for effective information security. As a result, GAO added two areas to its high-risk list: IT security in 1997 and the management of IT acquisitions and operations in 2015. This statement summarizes agencies' progress in improving IT management and ensuring the security of federal IT. It is primarily based on GAO's prior reports issued between February 1997 and May 2018 (and an ongoing review) on (1) CIO responsibilities, (2) agency CIOs' involvement in approving IT contracts, (3) data center consolidation efforts, (4) the management of software licenses, and (5) compliance with cybersecurity requirements. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and federal agencies have taken steps to improve the management of information technology (IT) acquisitions and operations and ensure the security of federal IT through a series of initiatives. As of May 2018, agencies had fully implemented about 61 percent of the approximately 800 IT management-related recommendations that GAO made from fiscal years 2010 through 2015. Likewise, since 2010, agencies had implemented about 66 percent of the approximately 2,700 security-related recommendations as of May 2018. Even with this progress, significant actions remain to be completed. Chief Information Officer (CIO) responsibilities . Laws such as the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) and related guidance assigned 35 key IT management responsibilities to CIOs to help address longstanding challenges. However, in a draft report on CIO responsibilities, GAO's preliminary results suggest that none of the 24 selected agencies have policies that fully address the role of their CIO, as called for by federal laws and guidance. GAO intends to recommend that OMB and each of the selected 24 agencies take actions to improve the effectiveness of CIO's implementation of their responsibilities. IT contract approval . According to FITARA, covered agencies' CIOs are required to review and approve IT contracts. Nevertheless, in January 2018, GAO reported that most of the CIOs at 22 selected agencies were not adequately involved in reviewing billions of dollars of IT acquisitions. Consequently, GAO made 39 recommendations to improve CIO oversight over IT acquisitions. Consolidating data centers . OMB launched an initiative in 2010 to reduce data centers, which was codified and expanded in FITARA. According to agencies, data center consolidation and optimization efforts have resulted in approximately $3.9 billion of cost savings through 2018. Even so, additional work remains. GAO has made 160 recommendations to OMB and agencies to improve the reporting of related cost savings and to achieve optimization targets; however, as of May 2018, 80 of the recommendations have not been fully addressed. Managing software licenses . Effective management of software licenses can help avoid purchasing too many licenses that result in unused software. In May 2014, GAO reported that better management of licenses was needed to achieve savings, and made 135 recommendations to improve such management. Four years later, 78 of the recommendations remained open. Improving the security of federal IT systems . While the government has acted to protect federal information systems, agencies need to improve security programs, cyber capabilities, and the protection of personally identifiable information. Over the last several years, GAO has made about 2,700 recommendations to agencies aimed at improving the security of federal systems and information. These recommendations identified actions for agencies to take to strengthen their information security programs and technical controls over their computer networks and systems. As of May 2018, about 800 of the information security-related recommendations had not been implemented. From fiscal years 2010 through 2015, GAO made about 800 recommendations to OMB and federal agencies to address shortcomings in IT acquisitions and operations. Since 2010, GAO also made about 2,700 recommendations to federal agencies to improve the security of federal systems. These recommendations include those to improve the implementation of CIO responsibilities, the oversight of the data center consolidation initiative, software license management efforts, and the strength of security programs and technical controls.

The U.S. has played a significant role in Bosnia's post-war development, including brokering the Dayton Agreement and providing substantial foreign aid. However, the complex political system established by Dayton, which divides the country into two ethnoterritorial entities (Republika Srpska and the Federation of BiH), has led to persistent ethnic tensions and institutional inefficiencies. The report highlights the challenges of reforming Bosnia's political structure, which is characterized by ethnic-based power-sharing, veto rights, and a lack of centralized authority. Corruption, patronage, and the dominance of ethnic parties have further hindered progress. The report also discusses the influence of external actors such as Russia, Turkey, and China, which have sought to exert political and economic leverage in the region. Additionally, the report addresses the threat of terrorism and the impact of migration on Bosnia's stability. The U.S. and EU continue to engage with Bosnia, but their influence has waned in recent years, raising concerns about the country's future. The report concludes that Bosnia's stability is crucial for regional security, and that sustained international support and reform efforts are necessary to address its deep-rooted challenges.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report about Bosnia and Herzegovina.

It mentions the political structure established by Dayton, which divides the country into two entities with ethnic majorities. There's a lot about ethnic tensions, the role of the U.S. and EU in post-war reconstruction, and the current political gridlock. Also, external influences like Russia, Turkey, and China are discussed. The report also covers issues like corruption, economic struggles, and the threat of terrorism. Plus, there's a section on U.S. Congress's involvement and the need for reform.\n\nSo, the summary needs to capture all these elements concisely. Let me outline the main sections:\n\n1. **Background**: The war, Dayton Agreement, and", "answers": ["Bosnia and Herzegovina (hereafter, \"Bosnia\") drew heavily on U.S. support after gaining independence from Yugoslavia in 1992. The United States helped end the Bosnian war (1992-1995), one of the most lethal conflicts in Europe since the Second World War, by leading NATO airstrikes against Bosnian Serb forces, brokering the Dayton Peace Agreement in 1995, and deploying 20,000 U.S. troops. Some Members of Congress became involved in policy debates over these measures, and Congress monitored and at times challenged the Bush and Clinton Administrations' response through numerous hearings, resolutions, and legislative proposals. Since 1995, the United States has been a major source of aid to Bosnia and firmly supports its territorial integrity. The United States also supports Bosnia's aspirations for NATO and European Union (EU) membership. Today, Bosnia faces serious challenges. Nearly 25 years after the Dayton Agreement, Bosnia continues to use part of the Agreement as its constitution, which divides the country into two ethnoterritorial entities. Critics charge that Bosnia's political system is too decentralized to enact the reforms required for NATO and EU membership. They also contend that the ethnic power-sharing arrangements and veto points embedded in numerous government bodies are sources of gridlock. Domestic and international courts have ruled against several aspects of Bosnia's constitution, yet the Bosnian government thus far has failed to implement these rulings. Since Bosnia's independence, its politics has been dominated by ethnic parties representing the country's three main groups: Bosniaks (Slavic Muslims), Croats, and Serbs. These parties have prospered under a system that critics charge lacks transparency and accountability. Critics also maintain that ethnic party leaders use divisive nationalist rhetoric to distract from serious issues affecting the country as a whole, including poverty, unemployment, and stalled political reforms. The Bosnian population exhibits low trust in political parties and the government, and disaffection toward the country's elite. U.S. and EU officials brokered several ultimately unsuccessful rounds of constitutional reform negotiations, and continue to call on Bosnia's leaders to implement reforms to make governance more efficient and effective, dismantle patronage networks, and bring Bosnia closer to EU and NATO membership. However, there is little consensus among the country's leaders on how the country should be reformed. Bosnian Serb leaders from the Serb-majority entity (Republika Srpska) have called for greater autonomy and even secession from Bosnia. Some Bosnian Croat leaders have called for partitioning Bosnia's other entity, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to create a separate Croat-majority entity. Bosniak leaders, by contrast, generally prefer a more centralized state. Many analysts caution that any move to partition the country could lead to renewed violence, while greater decentralization could make Bosnia's government less functional. U.S. policy has long been oriented toward preserving Bosnia's statehood. Bosnia's 2018 general elections largely returned to power the same entrenched ethnic parties. Of particular concern is the election of Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik to Bosnia's collective presidency. Dodik, a sharp critic of the United States and NATO, has periodically called for a referendum on Republika Srpska's secession. He is under U.S. sanctions for obstructing the Dayton Agreement. In addition to these internal challenges, U.S. and EU officials have expressed concern over external influence in the region. Russia reportedly relies on soft power, energy leverage, and \"spoiler\" tactics to influence Bosnia, particularly in the Serb-majority entity. Turkish soft power draws on Bosnia's Ottoman-era heritage and Turkey's shared religious tradition with Bosniaks. China is a more recent presence in the region, but its heavy investments and lending have prompted concern on both sides of the Atlantic. Policymakers have also expressed concern at the challenges posed by the return of Bosnians who fought with the Islamic State and Nusra Front in Syria and Iraq. Many observers contend that the United States remains a stakeholder in Bosnia's future because of its central role in resolving the conflict and shaping the postwar Bosnian state. Given the history of U.S. involvement in Bosnia, Bosnia's importance to regional stability in the Balkans, and concerns over Russian and Chinese influence in Bosnia, Members of Congress may be interested in monitoring how the country navigates its internal and external challenges. Congress may also consider future U.S. aid levels to Bosnia and the degree to which such assistance supports the long-standing U.S. policy objectives for Bosnia of territorial integrity, NATO and EU integration, energy security, and resilience against malign influence."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8598}

Various entities within the federal government are involved in the process of requesting, ordering, and collecting restitution for crime victims, including DOJ and the judiciary. The Justice for All Reauthorization Act of 2016 includes a provision for GAO to review the federal criminal restitution process for fiscal years 2014 through 2016. This report addresses, among other things: (1) the extent to which information is available on restitution requested by DOJ and ordered by courts; (2) the amount of restitution debt DOJ collected and the amount that remains outstanding; and, (3) the extent to which DOJ has conducted oversight on the collection of restitution. GAO analyzed laws, policies and procedures as well as USSC data on restitution orders and DOJ data on restitution collected from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. GAO also selected a non-generalizable sample of six federal judicial districts based on restitution collections and spoke with USAO officials and federal probation officers. Officials from selected U.S. Attorney's Offices (USAO) stated that they document requests for restitution in case files and employ other internal controls, such as the use of templates and forms, throughout the prosecution process to ensure that prosecutors request restitution as appropriate. GAO's analysis of U.S. Sentencing Commission (USSC) data—an agency within the judiciary—showed that information on restitution orders was available for 95 percent of all offenders sentenced from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. Specifically, 214,578 federal offenders were sentenced during this time period and restitution was ordered for 33,158, or 15 percent, of those offenders. Collectively, courts ordered these offenders to pay $33.9 billion in restitution. Most federal offenders sentenced during these years were sentenced for immigration or drug-related offenses. In interviews, USAO officials stated that these offenses do not typically have victims requiring restitution. GAO found that data on reasons why restitution was not ordered were incomplete for 5 percent of all offenders sentenced from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. Determining why data on restitution orders are incomplete may inform the judiciary of the cause of the incomplete data and any efforts needed to improve USSC data. GAO's analysis of Department of Justice (DOJ) data showed that USAOs collected $2.95 billion in restitution debt in fiscal years 2014 through 2016, see figure below. However, at the end of fiscal year 2016, $110 billion in previously ordered restitution remained outstanding, and USAOs identified $100 billion of that outstanding debt as uncollectible due to offenders' inability to pay. DOJ identified improving debt collection—including restitution—as a major management initiative in its 2014-2018 Strategic Plan. While DOJ is developing analytical tools to monitor the collection of restitution, it has not established performance measures or goals. Performance measures and goals would allow DOJ to gauge USAOs' success in collecting restitution and, by extension, the department's success in achieving a major management initiative.

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nFirst, the report explains that FMAGs are authorized under Section 420 of the Stafford Act. They were established in 2001 and are managed by FEMA's Regional Administrators. The main purpose is to provide federal assistance for fire suppression, with a 25% cost share from state, local, and tribal governments. The report also covers how FMAGs are requested, evaluated using cost thresholds, and the types of assistance provided. \n\nI should mention the process for requesting FMAGs, including the need for a governor's declaration, submitting requests via phone or written form, and the importance of cost estimates and fire details. The thresholds are important too—individual and cumulative thresholds vary by state. For example, Pennsylvania has higher thresholds than Alaska. The appeal process is also part of the procedure if a request is denied.\n\nThe report also talks about funding sources, the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), and how FMAGs are funded through base funding, not affecting major disaster funds. There's a mention of the Budget Control Act and how it allows for adjustments in discretionary spending. The cost-sharing structure is 75% federal, 25% state/local. \n\nAnother key point is the difference between FMAGs and other federal assistance, like the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) which doesn't require cost-sharing for tribes. Also, the Disaster Recovery Reform Act (DRRA) allows hazard mitigation grants for FMAGs. \n\nI need to note that FMAGs are used to avoid major disaster declarations, and they don't replace other federal programs like the Forest Service's assistance. There are exceptions where FMAGs can be used with other programs if there's a cooperative agreement. \n\nI should structure the summary to cover the purpose, request process, evaluation criteria, funding, cost-sharing, and key differences from other programs. Also, mention the appeal process and the role of the DRF. Make sure to keep it concise, one page, double-spaced, with 12-point font and 1-inch margins.

{"pred": " The Indian Health Service (IHS), established in 1955, provides health care to American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities, primarily in rural and underserved areas. IHS operates through a network of hospitals, clinics, and health stations, both federally and tribally managed, with a 2017 budget of $1.9 billion. Despite these efforts, IHS faces significant challenges in recruiting and retaining health care providers, with 25% of provider positions vacant in key areas as of November 2017. Vacancy rates vary by provider type and region, with physicians, nurses, and nurse practitioners experiencing the highest rates, particularly in areas like Albuquerque and Bemidji. The challenges are exacerbated by geographic isolation, limited amenities, and the difficulty of attracting providers to rural and tribal areas. IHS employs various strategies to address these issues, including special salary rates, recruitment and retention incentives, loan repayment programs, and subsidized housing. However, these efforts are often constrained by limited funding and resource allocation. IHS also utilizes telehealth services and alternative staffing models, such as hiring nurse practitioners and physician assistants, to maintain patient access to care. Despite these initiatives, the agency continues to struggle with provider shortages, which impact the quality and availability of health services. The report recommends that IHS obtain comprehensive data on temporary provider contractors to better allocate resources and address staffing gaps effectively.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report about the Indian Health Service (IHS).

They have a network of hospitals, clinics, and health stations, both federal and tribal. In 2017, they had a $1.9 billion budget. But there are a lot of vacancies in provider positions. The report mentions that as of November 2017, 25% of provider positions were vacant in key areas, with some areas having up to 46% vacancies for certain roles like physicians. \n\nThe challenges include rural locations, geographic isolation, and limited amenities.

According to IHS, AI/AN people born today have a life expectancy that is 5.5 years less than all races in the United States, and they die at higher rates than other Americans from preventable causes. The ability to recruit and retain a stable clinical workforce capable of providing quality and timely care is critical for IHS. GAO was asked to review provider vacancies at IHS. This report examines (1) IHS provider vacancies and challenges filling them; (2) strategies IHS has used to recruit and retain providers; and (3) strategies IHS has used to mitigate the negative effects of provider vacancies. GAO reviewed IHS human resources data for the provider positions that the agency tracks. GAO also reviewed policies, federal internal control standards, and legal authorities related to providers in federally operated IHS facilities. GAO interviewed IHS officials at the headquarters and area level and at selected facilities. GAO selected facilities based on variation in their number of direct care outpatient visits and inpatient hospital beds in 2014. Indian Health Service (IHS) data show sizeable vacancy rates for clinical care providers in the eight IHS geographic areas where the agency provides substantial direct care to American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) people. The overall vacancy rate for providers—physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, certified registered nurse anesthetists, certified nurse midwives, physician assistants, dentists, and pharmacists—was 25 percent, ranging from 13 to 31 percent across the areas. IHS officials told GAO that challenges to filling these vacancies include the rural location of many IHS facilities and insufficient housing for providers. Officials said long-standing vacancies have a negative effect on patient access, quality of care, and employee morale. IHS uses multiple strategies to recruit and retain providers, including offering increased salaries for certain positions, but it still faces challenges matching local market salaries. IHS also offers other financial incentives, and has made some housing available when possible. In addition, IHS uses strategies, such as contracting with temporary providers, to maintain patient access to services and reduce provider burnout. Officials said these temporary providers are more costly than salaried employees and can interrupt patients' continuity of care. However, IHS lacks agency-wide information on the costs and number of temporary providers used at its facilities, which impedes IHS officials' ability to target its resources to address gaps in provider staffing and ensure access to health services across IHS facilities. GAO recommends that IHS obtain, on an agency-wide basis, information on temporary provider contractors, including their associated cost and number of full-time equivalents, and use this information to inform decisions about resource allocation and provider staffing.

{"pred": " The report highlights the challenges faced by the U.S. Navy's attack submarine fleet, particularly regarding maintenance delays and idle time, which have significant financial and operational impacts. The Navy currently operates 51 attack submarines, with a mix of Los Angeles, Seawolf, and Virginia classes, homeported in various U.S. and overseas locations. The tragic loss of the USS Thresher in 1963 led to the establishment of the SUBSAFE program, which has since ensured no SUBSAFE-certified submarine has been lost. However, maintenance delays have persisted, with the Navy experiencing 10,363 days of idle time and maintenance delays from fiscal year 2008 to 2018, primarily due to depot maintenance issues. These delays have resulted in over $1.5 billion in operating and support costs, with additional costs expected in the coming years. The report attributes these delays to factors such as workforce shortages, facility limitations, and parts shortages at public shipyards. While the Navy has taken steps to address these issues, including hiring more personnel and planning capital investments, the challenges remain significant. The report recommends a comprehensive business case analysis to optimize maintenance workload allocation between public and private shipyards, considering both costs and benefits. It emphasizes the need for proactive management to ensure the Navy maximizes the operational readiness of its attack submarine fleet, given the critical role these submarines play in national security.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report.

These capabilities make attack submarines some of the most–requested assets by the global combatant commanders. GAO was asked to review the readiness of the Navy's attack submarine force. This report discusses the extent to which the Navy (1) has experienced maintenance delays in its attack submarine fleet and costs associated with any delays; and (2) has addressed any challenges and developed mitigation plans for any maintenance delays. GAO analyzed readiness information from fiscal years 2008-2018, operating and support costs, maintenance performance, and other data; visited attack submarines and squadrons; and interviewed public and private shipyard and fleet officials. This is a public version of a classified report issued in October 2018. Information the Department of Defense deemed classified or sensitive, such as attack submarine force structure requirements and detailed data on attack submarine maintenance delays, has been omitted. The Navy has been unable to begin or complete the vast majority of its attack submarine maintenance periods on time resulting in significant maintenance delays and operating and support cost expenditures. GAO's analysis of Navy maintenance data shows that between fiscal year 2008 and 2018, attack submarines have incurred 10,363 days of idle time and maintenance delays as a result of delays in getting into and out of the shipyards. For example, the Navy originally scheduled the USS Boise to enter a shipyard for an extended maintenance period in 2013 but, due to heavy shipyard workload, the Navy delayed the start of the maintenance period. In June 2016, the USS Boise could no longer conduct normal operations and the boat has remained idle, pierside for over two years since then waiting to enter a shipyard (see figure). GAO estimated that since fiscal year 2008 the Navy has spent more than $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2018 constant dollars to support attack submarines that provide no operational capability—those sitting idle while waiting to enter the shipyards, and those delayed in completing their maintenance at the shipyards. The Navy has started to address challenges related to workforce shortages and facilities needs at the public shipyards. However, it has not effectively allocated maintenance periods among public shipyards and private shipyards that may also be available to help minimize attack submarine idle time. GAO's analysis found that while the public shipyards have operated above capacity for the past several years, attack submarine maintenance delays are getting longer and idle time is increasing. The Navy may have options to mitigate this idle time and maintenance delays by leveraging private shipyard capacity for repair work. But the Navy has not completed a comprehensive business case analysis as recommended by Department of Defense guidelines to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards. Navy leadership has acknowledged that they need to be more proactive in leveraging potential private shipyard repair capacity. Without addressing this challenge, the Navy risks continued expenditure of operating and support funding to crew, maintain, and support attack submarines that provide no operational capability because they are delayed in getting into and out of maintenance. GAO recommends that the Navy conduct a business case analysis to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards.

Since the 1990s, Congress has enacted restrictions regarding the use of certain appropriated funds to promote U.S. tobacco exports. GAO was asked to review the implementation of these restrictions. This report examines (1) guidance select U.S. agencies have issued to implement these restrictions, (2) whether overseas officials from select U.S. agencies were aware of the restrictions and guidance, and (3) select U.S. agencies' implementation of the guidance overseas. GAO reviewed U.S. laws, agency guidance, and internal communications; analyzed Commerce data; and interviewed agency officials in Washington, D.C. and in 24 offices across 11 overseas posts in 9 countries. GAO selected these countries based on criteria that included U.S. tobacco export totals, smoking rates, and geographic dispersion. Congress has restricted the use of certain appropriated funding to promote tobacco exports and the Departments of State (State), Commerce (Commerce), and Agriculture (USDA) have issued interagency guidance through the cable system that they rely on to implement these restrictions. State collaborates with these and other agencies to periodically update this cable. The cable informs officials about the types of actions they should take—such as providing routine business facilitation services to all U.S. companies—and the types of actions they should not take—such as attending events sponsored by tobacco companies. Most, but not all, officials overseas that GAO interviewed were aware of the restrictions and received some guidance concerning the restrictions. However, GAO found that some officials did not recall receiving the interagency guidance cable. In addition, State and USDA's current training materials do not address the restrictions. Federal internal control standards state that appropriate training is essential to an organization's operational success. Thus, providing officials overseas with training about the funding restrictions and related guidance would help to ensure that officials are aware of the restrictions. U.S. officials overseas have implemented restrictions on promoting tobacco, but some officials said that the interagency guidance lacks clarity. Officials said that they have not promoted tobacco by, for example, attending events sponsored solely by tobacco companies. However, officials identified three areas of the guidance that are unclear: (1) attendance at events not sponsored by U.S. tobacco companies but attended by representatives of these companies; (2) the types of services officials can provide tobacco companies; and (3) the description of tobacco products, such as whether component parts for electronic cigarettes are included. Federal standards for internal control state that management should clearly document internal controls in policies and guidance to prevent officials from failing to achieve an objective or address a risk. By providing more specific guidance, the agencies would help ensure that officials consistently implement the funding restrictions on promoting tobacco. GAO recommends that (1) State and USDA include information about the funding restrictions and guidance in training materials for relevant employees and (2) State, in consultation with Commerce and USDA, assess and update the interagency guidance cable, as needed, on promoting tobacco in light of questions raised by officials at posts overseas.

The main issues are inadequate documentation of reviews, untimely reviews, and failure to report providers to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards. \n\nFirst, the report mentions that from October 2013 to March 2017, five VA medical centers had 148 providers reviewed after concerns were raised. However, officials couldn't provide documentation for almost half of these reviews. Specifically, they lacked documentation for 26 providers regarding focused professional practice evaluations (FPPEs) for cause and 8 providers for retrospective reviews. Some reviews weren't conducted at all. Also, reviews were delayed, with some taking months or even years to start, which is problematic because other concerns were raised during that time.\n\nThe reasons given for these issues are that VHA policy doesn't require documentation for all reviews and lacks timeliness requirements. Additionally, VHA's oversight is inadequate because networks don't routinely check these reviews, and the audit tools used don't ensure proper documentation. \n\nThen, the report talks about the failure to report providers to NPDB and state boards. Out of nine providers who should have been reported, only one was. Some providers were terminated for clinical deficiencies but weren't reported. The VA centers didn't follow up on reporting due to misunderstanding policies or thinking that other boards had already been informed. This lack of reporting allows substandard providers to work elsewhere, as seen in cases where providers were not reported but later had their privileges revoked at other facilities.\n\nThe recommendations from the report include requiring documentation for all reviews, establishing timeliness, and strengthening oversight through networks.

The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care.

As such, some agency actions, such as guidance documents, that are not subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures may still be considered rules under the CRA and thus could be overturned using the CRA's procedures. The effect of Congress disapproving a rule that is not subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking may be subject to debate, given that such rules are generally viewed to lack any legal effect in the first place. Nonetheless, the CRA does encompass some such rules, as highlighted by the recent enactment of a CRA resolution overturning a bulletin from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that was not subject to the notice-and-comment procedures. Even if an agency action falls under the CRA's definition of \"rule,\" however, the expedited procedures for considering legislation to overturn the rule only become available when the agency submits the rule to Congress. In many cases in which agencies take actions that fall under the scope of a \"rule\" but have not gone through notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures, agencies fail to submit those rules. Thus, questions have arisen as to how Members can avail themselves of the CRA's special fast-track procedures if the agency has not submitted the action to Congress. To protect its prerogative to review agency rules under the CRA, Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) have developed an ad hoc process in which Members can request that GAO provide a formal legal opinion on whether a particular agency action qualifies as a rule under the CRA. If GAO concludes that the action in question falls within the CRA's definition of \"rule,\" Congress has treated the publication of the GAO opinion in the Congressional Record as constructive submission of the rule. In other words, an affirmative opinion from GAO can allow Congress to use the CRA procedures to consider legislation overturning an agency action despite the agency not submitting that action to Congress."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12318}
{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is about the VA's challenges in aligning their services and real property with the needs of veterans. There are several key issues mentioned: geographic shifts in the veteran population, changes in healthcare delivery from inpatient to outpatient, aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement. \n\nFirst, the VA has a lot of old buildings that are vacant or underutilized. They mentioned 430 vacant buildings and 784 underutilized ones, all over 60 years old. Some of these are historic, which complicates renovation or demolition. For example, in some cases, historic preservation laws prevent demolition even if it's needed. That's a problem because renovating might be more expensive than demolishing.\n\nThen there's the issue with stakeholder engagement. The VA hasn't consistently involved stakeholders like veterans, local officials, and organizations, leading to adversarial relationships. This makes it harder to align facilities with veterans' needs. The report mentions two planning processes: SCIP and VAIP. SCIP has issues with delays and limited information, making it hard for local officials to know if their projects will get funded. VAIP's facility master plans assume all growth will be through VA facilities, but they're not considering non-VA care options, which are more common now. The report suggests that VA should reassess these plans.\n\nThe report also compares VA's situation to the DOD's BRAC process, which had structured steps like setting goals, criteria, cost estimates, organizational structure, analytical frameworks, oversight mechanisms, and involving auditors. The VA could learn from these elements to improve their own processes. However, VA hasn't fully addressed the limitations in SCIP and VAIP, and there's a need for better stakeholder engagement and more accurate planning.\n\nI need to condense all this into a one-page summary. Start with the main problem: VA's challenges in aligning services and facilities. Then outline the key issues: aging infrastructure, shift to outpatient care, historic buildings, stakeholder engagement, and planning processes. Mention the specific numbers about vacant and underutilized buildings. Discuss the SCIP and VAIP processes and their limitations. Then touch on the BRAC process as a model for VA to follow. Conclude with the recommendations and the need for action. Make sure it's concise,", "answers": ["VA operates one of the largest health care systems in the United States, utilizing more than 6,000 federally owned and 1,500 leased buildings. DOD has repeatedly applied the BRAC process to reduce the amount of unneeded property that it owns and leases and to save billions of dollars that could be applied to higher priority defense needs. This statement is based on GAO's April 2017 report related to VA facility alignment ( GAO-17-349 ) and numerous GAO reports related to the BRAC process as summarized in a June 2011 testimony ( GAO-11-704T ) and a March 2012 testimony ( GAO-12-513T ). This statement addresses (1) the factors that affect VA's facility alignment and the extent to which VA's capital-planning process facilitates the alignment of facilities with the veterans' population, and (2) the key elements and challenges affecting DOD and the Commission in BRAC 2005. Detailed information on our scope and methodologies for this work can be found in these published products, cited throughout this testimony. Geographic shifts in the veterans' population, changes in health care delivery, aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement affect the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) efforts to align its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. For example, a shift over time from inpatient to outpatient care will likely result in underutilized space once used for inpatient care. Further, the historic status of some VA facilities adds to the complexity of converting or disposing of them. In such instances, it is often difficult and costly for VA to modernize, renovate, and retrofit these older facilities. GAO reported that two of the planning processes VA uses to align its facilities—VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) and the VA Integrated Planning (VAIP)—have limitations that undermine VA's efforts to achieve its goals. Specifically: VA relies on the SCIP process to plan and prioritize capital projects, but VA routinely asks its facility planners to submit their next year's planned project narratives before knowing if their previous submissions have been funded. The overlapping budget cycle, which is outside of VA's control, combined with other SCIP limitations—including subjective narratives, long time frames, and restricted access to information—make it difficult for VA to rely on SCIP to accurately identify the capital necessary to address its service and infrastructure gaps. VA concurred that it needs to address SCIP limitations that are within its control, as GAO recommended; VA has made some progress in implementing the recommendation has made some progress in implementing the recommendation.\\ The VAIP process is estimated to cost $108 million and to produce market-level service delivery plans and facility master plans. However, the VAIP master plans incorrectly assume that all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities without considering alternatives, such as purchasing care from the community. GAO recommended that VA consider discontinuing the VAIP facility master plans pending an assessment of their value as a facility-planning tool. VA agreed with the recommendation and is implementing it while pursuing a national realignment strategy.. Key elements of the Department of Defense's (DOD) 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process could benefit VA's asset and infrastructure review. The key elements included: (1) establishing goals for the process, (2) developing criteria for evaluating closures and realignments, and (3) establishing an organizational structure to develop closure and realignment options. GAO identified key challenges that affected DOD's implementation of BRAC 2005 and the results achieved; these challenges would need to be addressed if VA is to successfully apply the process. These challenges included: (1) large, complex recommendations required sustained senior leadership's attention and a high level of coordination among many stakeholders, and (2) the large number of actions that depend on each other for successful implementation. In the April 2017 report, GAO made recommendations related to capital planning and stakeholder involvement.

{"pred": " The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has faced significant challenges in modernizing its financial management systems, leading to the designation of its management functions as high risk. The TRIO project, aimed at modernizing the systems of the Coast Guard, Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO), has encountered numerous issues, including delays, cost overruns, and inadequate risk management. Despite initial efforts to adopt a decentralized approach and evaluate federal Shared Service Providers (SSPs), the project has struggled with implementation, particularly due to the selection of IBC as the SSP. The analysis of alternatives (AA) process used by the TRIO components did not fully adhere to best practices, increasing the risk of selecting an unsuitable solution. Additionally, risk management practices were not consistently followed, leading to significant challenges in project execution. The report highlights the need for improved guidance and processes to ensure adherence to best practices in both alternatives analysis and risk management, ultimately to achieve the project's objectives and ensure effective financial management for DHS.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report. Let me start by understanding the main points. The report is about the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and their TRIO project, which aims to modernize financial management systems for three agencies: Coast Guard, TSA, and DNDO. \n\nFirst, the report mentions that DHS has had internal control and financial management issues since 2003, leading to high-risk designation. The TRIO project was initiated to upgrade legacy systems, but there were problems. They considered federal SSPs, like IBC, which was designated as a federal SSP. However, the project faced delays and challenges. \n\nThe report talks about the Alternatives Analysis (AA) process used by the TRIO components. They didn't fully follow best practices from GAO, which led to risks in selecting the right solution. Also, risk management wasn't properly handled, leading to issues like cost overruns and schedule delays. \n\nThe key findings include that the AA process was incomplete, and risk management practices were not fully implemented. The project had to delay implementations for TSA and Coast Guard. The report recommends improving guidance and processes for future projects to adhere to best practices in both AA and risk management.\n\nNow, I need to condense this into a one-page summary. Start with the main issue: DHS's financial management issues and the TRIO project. Mention the problems with the AA process and risk management. Highlight the consequences like delays and cost overruns.", "answers": ["To help address long-standing financial management system deficiencies, DHS initiated its TRIO project, which has focused on migrating three of its components to a modernized financial management system provided by IBC, an OMB-designated, federal SSP. House Report Number 3128 included a provision for GAO to assess the risks of DHS using IBC in connection with its modernization efforts. This report examines (1) the extent to which DHS and the TRIO components followed best practices in analyzing alternatives, and the key factors, metrics, and processes used in their choice of a modernized financial management system; (2) the extent to which DHS managed the risks of using IBC for its TRIO project consistent with risk management best practices; and (3) the key factors and challenges that have impacted the TRIO project and DHS's plans for completing remaining key priorities. GAO interviewed key officials, reviewed relevant documents, and determined whether DHS followed best practices identified by GAO as necessary characteristics of a reliable, high-quality AOA process and other risk management best practices. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) TRIO project represents a key effort to address long-standing financial management system deficiencies. During 2012 and 2013, the TRIO components—U.S. Coast Guard (Coast Guard), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO)—each completed an alternatives analysis (AA) to determine a preferred alternative for modernizing its financial management system. GAO found that DNDO's AA substantially met the four characteristics—well-documented, comprehensive, unbiased, and credible—that GAO previously identified for a reliable, high-quality analysis of alternatives (AOA) process. However, Coast Guard's and TSA's AAs did not fully or substantially meet three of these characteristics, and DHS guidance for conducting AAs did not substantially incorporate certain best practices, such as identifying significant risks and mitigation strategies and performing an independent review to help validate the AOA process. Based on these analyses and other factors, the TRIO components determined that migrating to a federal shared service provider (SSP) represented the best alternative, and in 2014, DHS selected the Department of the Interior's Interior Business Center (IBC) as the federal SSP for the project. However, because Coast Guard's and TSA's AAs did not fully or substantially reflect all of the characteristics noted above, they are at increased risk that the alternative selected may not achieve mission needs. DHS also did not fully follow best practices for managing project risks related to its use of IBC on the TRIO project. Specifically, DHS followed three of seven risk management best practices, such as determining risk sources and categories and establishing a risk management strategy. However, it did not fully follow four best practices for defining risk parameters, identifying risks, developing risk mitigation plans, and implementing these plans largely because its guidance did not sufficiently address these best practices. For example, although DHS created joint teams with IBC and provided additional resources to IBC to help address risk mitigation concerns, it did not always develop sufficiently detailed risk mitigation plans that also included contingency plans for selected critical risks. As a result, although IBC's capacity and experience for migrating large agencies the size of Coast Guard and TSA was identified as a risk in July 2014, a contingency plan working group to address this concern was not established until January 2017. By not fully following risk management best practices, DHS is at increased risk that potential problems may not be identified or properly mitigated. DHS, IBC, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and other federal oversight agencies identified various challenges that have impacted the TRIO project and contributed to a 2-year delay in the implementation of Coast Guard's and TSA's modernized solutions. These challenges include the lack of sufficient resources, aggressive schedule, complex requirements, increased costs, and project management and communication concerns. To help address these challenges, DHS and IBC established review teams and have taken other steps to assess potential mitigating steps. In May 2017, DHS determined that migrating the solution from IBC to a DHS data center represented the best option and initiated discovery efforts to further assess this as its path forward for the TRIO project. GAO recommends that DHS more fully follow best practices for conducting an AOA process and managing risks.

{"pred": " The report discusses the implementation and challenges of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), a U.S. law aimed at combating tax evasion by requiring foreign financial institutions (FFIs) to report information about U.S. persons' foreign financial accounts. FATCA mandates that FFIs report detailed information on U.S. customers annually, with exceptions for jurisdictions with intergovernmental agreements (IGAs) that facilitate compliance. The report highlights several key issues, including the difficulty in obtaining accurate Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TINs) from FFIs, which hinders IRS's ability to match data between FFIs and individual taxpayers. It also notes the overlap between FATCA and the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) reporting requirements, leading to redundant filings and increased compliance burdens for U.S. persons. The report further examines the impact of FATCA on U.S. persons living abroad, including challenges in accessing financial services, employment opportunities, and obtaining Social Security Numbers (SSNs). Additionally, it discusses the lack of a comprehensive strategy by the IRS to leverage FATCA data effectively and the need for improved interagency collaboration to address these issues. The report concludes with recommendations for the IRS, Treasury, and other agencies to enhance compliance efforts, improve data management, and establish collaborative mechanisms to mitigate the challenges posed by FATCA.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this detailed report on FATCA. Let me start by understanding the main points. The report is about FATCA, which is a U.S. law to prevent tax evasion by requiring foreign financial institutions to report info on U.S. citizens' foreign accounts. \n\nFirst, the report explains FATCA's requirements: FFIs must report detailed info on U.S. customers annually. There are two types of IGAs, Model 1 and Model 2, which help FFIs comply. But there are challenges, like getting accurate TINs from U.S. persons, which are crucial for matching data between FFIs and individual taxpayers. The IRS has issues with incomplete or invalid TINs, leading to difficulties in enforcement.\n\nThen, there's the overlap with FBAR (Bank Secrecy Act) reporting. Both FATCA and FBAR require reporting on foreign financial assets, leading to redundant filings. This causes confusion and extra work for taxpayers. The report mentions that many Forms 8938 might be filed unnecessarily, possibly due to confusion about reporting thresholds and asset types.\n\nThe report also discusses the impact on U.S. persons living abroad. FATCA has led", "answers": ["Concerns over efforts by U.S. taxpayers to use offshore accounts to hide income or evade taxes contributed to the passage of FATCA in 2010, which sought to create greater transparency and accountability over offshore assets held by U.S. taxpayers. House Report 114-624 included a provision for GAO to evaluate FATCA implementation and determine the effects of FATCA on U.S. citizens living abroad. GAO—among other things—(1) assessed IRS's efforts to use FATCA-related information to improve taxpayer compliance; (2) examined the extent to which Treasury administers overlapping reporting requirements on financial assets held overseas; and (3) examined the effects of FATCA implementation unique to U.S. persons living abroad. GAO reviewed applicable documentation; analyzed tax data; and interviewed officials from IRS, other federal agencies and organizations, selected tax practitioners, and more than 20 U.S. persons living overseas. Data quality and management issues have limited the effectiveness of the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) efforts to improve taxpayer compliance using foreign financial asset data collected under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). Specifically, IRS has had difficulties matching the information reported by foreign financial institutions (FFI) with U.S. taxpayers' tax filings due to missing or inaccurate Taxpayer Identification Numbers provided by FFIs. Further, IRS lacks access to consistent and complete data on foreign financial assets and other data reported in tax filings by U.S. persons, in part, because some IRS databases do not store foreign asset data reported from paper filings. IRS has also stopped pursuing a comprehensive plan to leverage FATCA data to improve taxpayer compliance because, according to IRS officials, IRS moved away from updating broad strategy documents to focus on individual compliance campaigns. Ensuring access to consistent and complete data collected from U.S. persons—and employing a plan to leverage such data—would help IRS better leverage such campaigns and increase taxpayer compliance. Due to overlapping statutory reporting requirements, IRS and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)—both within the Department of the Treasury (Treasury)—collect duplicative foreign financial account and other asset information from U.S. persons. Consequently, in tax years 2015 and 2016, close to 75 percent of U.S. persons who reported information on foreign accounts and other assets on their tax returns also filed a separate form with FinCEN. The overlapping requirements increase the compliance burden on U.S. persons and add complexity that can create confusion, potentially resulting in inaccurate or unnecessary reporting. Modifying the statutes governing the requirements to allow for the sharing of FATCA information for the prevention and detection of financial crimes would eliminate the need for duplicative reporting. This is similar to other statutory allowances for IRS to disclose return information for other purposes, such as for determining Social Security income tax withholding. According to documents GAO reviewed, and focus groups and interviews GAO conducted, FFIs closed some U.S. persons' existing accounts or denied them opportunities to open new accounts after FATCA was enacted due to increased costs, and risks they pose under FATCA reporting requirements. According to Department of State (State) data, annual approvals of renunciations of U.S. citizenship increased from 1,601 to 4,449—or nearly 178 percent—from 2011 through 2016, attributable in part to the difficulties cited above. Treasury previously established joint strategies with State to address challenges U.S. persons faced in accessing foreign financial services. However, it lacks a collaborative mechanism to coordinate efforts with other agencies to address ongoing challenges in accessing such services or obtaining Social Security Numbers. Implementation of a formal means to collaboratively address burdens faced by Americans abroad from FATCA can help federal agencies develop more effective solutions to mitigate such burdens by monitoring and sharing information on such issues, and jointly developing and implementing steps to address them. GAO is making one matter for congressional consideration to address overlap in foreign asset reporting requirements. GAO is making seven recommendations to IRS and other agencies to enhance IRS's ability to leverage FATCA data to enforce compliance, address unnecessary reporting, and better collaborate to mitigate burdens on U.S. persons living abroad.

{"pred": " The report provides an overview of the U.S. government's use of emergency and contingency-designated funding since the September 11, 2001 attacks, focusing on the allocation and oversight of funds for war-related and international operations. Since 2001, Congress has appropriated approximately $2 trillion in discretionary budget authority for these purposes, with the Department of Defense (DOD) receiving the largest share ($1.8 trillion), followed by the Department of State and USAID ($154 billion), and the Department of Homeland Security and Coast Guard ($3 billion). This funding is designated as emergency requirements or Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terror (OCO/GWOT) and is exempt from certain budgetary limits, such as those imposed by the Budget Control Act (BCA). The report highlights the evolution of these designations, noting that the term \"Global War on Terror\" was replaced by \"Overseas Contingency Operations\" in 2009 under the Obama administration. The report also discusses the increasing use of OCO funding for activities beyond traditional war-related expenses, such as infrastructure, support operations, and non-war-related programs, which has sparked debate over its appropriateness and transparency. The BCA, enacted in 2011, set spending caps on defense and non-defense discretionary budgets, but OCO funding is exempt from these caps, allowing for continued flexibility in funding operations. The report notes that while OCO funding has been used to support ongoing operations and address unforeseen needs, critics argue it has become a \"slush fund\" for base budget requirements, potentially circumventing budgetary constraints. The report also examines the impact of the BCA on OCO funding, including how the caps have been adjusted through subsequent legislation and the implications for future budgeting. It highlights the challenges of defining and overseeing OCO spending, as well as the potential consequences of relying on this flexible funding mechanism for long-term strategic goals. The report concludes with recommendations for improving transparency and accountability in the use of OCO funds, including the need for clearer definitions, better oversight, and potential reforms to the budgetary process to ensure responsible and effective allocation of resources.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points. \n\nThe report is about the U.S. government's use of emergency and contingency funding since 9/11, specifically focusing on OCO/GWOT", "answers": ["Congressional interest in Overseas Contingency Operation (OCO) funding has continued as Members debate ways of funding priorities without breaching discretionary spending limits set in law. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress has appropriated approximately $2 trillion in discretionary budget authority designated as emergency requirements or for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism (OCO/GWOT) in support of the broad U.S. government response to the 9/11 attacks and for other related international affairs activities. This figure amounts to approximately 9.4% of total discretionary spending during this period. Congress has used supplemental appropriation acts or designated funding for emergency requirements or OCO/GWOT—or both—in statute. These funds are not subject to limits on discretionary spending in congressional budget resolutions or to the statutory discretionary spending limits established by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-125). The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA; P.L. 99-177) allows emergency funding to be excluded from budget control limits. The BCA added the OCO/GWOT designation to the BBEDCA exemption, thereby providing Congress and the President with an alternate way to exclude funding from the BCA spending limits. While there is no overall statutory limit on the amount of emergency or OCO/GWOT spending, both Congress and the President have fundamental roles in determining how much of the spending to provide each fiscal year. Congress must designate any such funding in statute on an account-by-account basis. The President is also required to designate it as such after it is appropriated to be available for expenditure. Debate over what should constitute OCO/GWOT or emergency activities and expenses has shifted over time, reflecting differing viewpoints about the extent, nature, and duration of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere. Funding designated for OCO/GWOT has also been used to fund base-budget requirements of the DOD and State Department and to prevent or respond to crises abroad, including armed conflict, as well as human-caused and natural disasters. Some defense officials and policymakers argue OCO funding allows for flexible response to contingencies, and provides a \"safety valve\" to the spending caps and threat of sequestration—the automatic cancellation of budget authority largely through across-the-board reductions of nonexempt programs and activities—under the BCA. Critics, however, have described OCO/GWOT as a loophole or \"gimmick\"—morphing from an account for replacing combat losses of equipment, resupplying expended munitions, and transporting troops through war zones, to a \"slush fund\" for activities unrelated to contingency operations. Congress appropriated approximately $103 billion for OCO in FY2017 (8.5% of all discretionary appropriations), $78 billion for OCO in FY2018 (5.5% of all discretionary appropriations), and $68.8 billion for OCO so far in FY2019. Discretionary appropriations for FY2019 are not yet final; a continuing resolution expired December 21, 2018. Following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123), which raised discretionary budget caps for defense and foreign affairs agencies in FY2018 and FY2019, the Administration proposed shifting some OCO funding into the base, or regular, budget. Although Congress has generally not followed Administration requests for reduced funding for foreign affairs and domestic activities and has increased funding for defense, the President has asked cabinet secretaries to propose spending cuts of 5% in FY2020. Such proposals, if requested in a budget submission, may create difficult choices for Congress in FY2020 and FY2021—the final two years of the BCA discretionary spending limits. Congress's decisions on OCO/GWOT designations will affect how much agency funding is available for military operations and foreign affairs activities overseas, how much is subject to the BCA caps, and how much is incorporated into regular budgets and long-term budget projections."], "all_classes": null, "length": 9854}

It has a history of political instability and conflict, especially in the east, where there's ongoing violence and sexual violence. The conflict minerals mentioned are tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold, which are used in various products. The Dodd-Frank Act requires SEC to create a disclosure rule for these minerals.\n\nThe report discusses the SEC's conflict minerals disclosure rule, which requires companies to determine if they use these minerals, conduct origin inquiries, and perform due diligence. In 2017, 1,165 companies filed disclosures, similar to previous years. Most companies performed country-of-origin inquiries, but challenges remain in tracing the minerals' sources. About 96% conducted due diligence, with most using the OECD framework. However, only 37% could confirm the minerals came from covered countries or recycled sources, while 47% couldn't confirm the source. Some companies declared their products \"DRC conflict free\" with audits.\n\nThe report also covers sexual violence in the DRC and neighboring countries. Data from surveys in Uganda and Burundi show high rates of sexual violence. In the DRC, UN and State reports noted continued cases, with armed groups and security forces involved. Political instability in the DRC, like delayed elections, contributed to a resurgence of violence.\n\nThe SEC's guidance in 2017 allowed companies flexibility in reporting, but enforcement could still occur.

In the eastern DRC, armed groups have committed severe human rights abuses, including sexual violence, and reportedly profit from the exploitation of “conflict minerals”— in particular, tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold, according to the United Nations. Congress included a provision in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that, among other things, required the SEC to promulgate regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals from the DRC and adjoining countries. The SEC adopted these regulations in 2012. The act also included a provision for GAO to annually assess the SEC regulations' effectiveness in promoting peace and security and report on the rate of sexual violence in the DRC and adjoining countries. In this report, GAO provides information about (1) companies' conflict minerals disclosures filed with the SEC in 2017 compared with disclosures filed in the prior 2 years and (2) the rate of sexual violence in the eastern DRC and adjoining countries published in 2017 and early 2018. GAO analyzed a generalizable random sample of SEC filings and interviewed relevant officials. GAO reviewed U.S., United Nations, and international organizations' reports; interviewed DRC officials, and other stakeholders; and conducted fieldwork in New York at the United Nations headquarters. GAO is not making any recommendations. GAO's review of companies' conflict minerals disclosures filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2017 found that, in general, they were similar to disclosures filed in the prior 2 years. In 2017, 1,165 companies filed conflict minerals disclosures—about the same as in 2016 and 2015. Percentages of companies reporting country-of-origin inquiries in 2017 were also similar to the percentages from those 2 prior years. As a result of the inquiries they conducted, an estimated 53 percent of companies reported in 2017 whether the conflict minerals in their products came from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries—similar to the estimated 49 percent in 2016 and 2015 but significantly higher than the estimate of 30 percent in 2014 (see figure). In their 2017 disclosure reports, many companies described actions they took to improve data collection processes, and most companies indicated some challenges in determining the country of origin. Similar to the prior 2 years, almost all companies required to conduct due diligence, as a result of their country-of-origin inquiries, reported doing so. After conducting due diligence to determine the source and chain of custody of any conflict minerals used, an estimated 37 percent of these companies reported in 2017 that they were able to determine that their conflict minerals came from covered countries or from scrap or recycled sources, compared with 39 and 23 percent in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Four companies in GAO's sample declared their products “DRC conflict-free,” and of those, three included the required Independent Private Sector Audit report (IPSA), and one did not. In 2017, 16 companies filed an IPSA; 19 did so in 2016. GAO found information on the rate of sexual violence in the 2017 Uganda and Burundi Demographic and Health Surveys.

The length of the process varies, ranging from a single day to months.\n\n2. **Visa Types and Categories**: NIVs are categorized into seven groups, with the majority being tourist and business visitor visas (about 80% of all adjudications). Other significant categories include student and exchange visitor visas (9%) and temporary worker visas (6%). The validity period and number of entries vary based on the visa type and reciprocity agreements with the applicant's country of nationality.\n\n3. **Trends in Adjudications**: NIV adjudications peaked at 13.4 million in fiscal year 2016 but declined by about 7% in 2017. The summer months typically saw a peak in applications, attributed to international students, but this trend shifted in 2017, with a peak in December. The decline in 2017 was partly due to a decrease in Chinese applicants.\n\n4. **Refusal Rates**: The overall refusal rate for NIVs increased from 14% in 2012 to 22% in 2016, remaining around 18% in 2017. The highest refusal rates were for tourist and business visitor visas, while other categories like foreign officials and employees had lower rates. Most refusals were due to applicants being deemed ineligible nonimmigrants or lacking adequate documentation.\n\n5. **Executive Actions and Entry Restrictions**: In 2017, the President issued executive orders and a proclamation imposing nationality-based entry restrictions on nationals from eight countries, affecting NIV adjudications. These restrictions were upheld by the Supreme Court, leading to continued implementation as of June 2018. The impact of these actions included a 22% decrease in adjudications for nationals from the seven", "answers": ["Previous attempted and successful terrorist attacks against the United States have raised questions about the security of the U.S. government's process for adjudicating NIVs, which are issued to foreign nationals, such as tourists, business visitors, and students, seeking temporary admission into the United States. For example, the December 2015 shootings in San Bernardino, California, led to concerns about NIV screening and vetting processes because one of the attackers was admitted into the United States under a NIV. In 2017, the President issued executive actions directing agencies to improve visa screening and vetting, and establishing nationality-based visa entry restrictions, which the Supreme Court upheld in June 2018. GAO was asked to review NIV screening and vetting. This report examines (1) outcomes and characteristics of adjudicated NIV applications from fiscal years 2012 through 2017, and (2) key changes made to the NIV adjudication process in response to executive actions taken in 2017. GAO analyzed State NIV adjudication data for fiscal years 2012 through 2017, the most recent and complete data available. GAO visited seven consular posts selected based on visa workload and other factors. GAO reviewed relevant executive orders and proclamations, and documents related to implementing these actions. This is a public version of a sensitive report issued in June 2018. Information that DHS, State, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence deemed sensitive has been removed. The total number of nonimmigrant visa (NIV) applications that Department of State (State) consular officers adjudicated annually peaked at about 13.4 million in fiscal year 2016, and decreased by about 880,000 adjudications in fiscal year 2017. NIV adjudications varied by visa group, country of nationality, and refusal reason: Visa group. From fiscal years 2012 through 2017, about 80 percent of NIV adjudications were for tourists and business visitors. During this time, adjudications for temporary workers increased by about 50 percent and decreased for students and exchange visitors by about 2 percent. Country of nationality. In fiscal year 2017, more than half of all NIV adjudications were for applicants of six countries of nationality: China (2.02 million, or 16 percent), Mexico (1.75 million, or 14 percent), India (1.28 million, or 10 percent), Brazil (670,000, or 5 percent), Colombia (460,000, or 4 percent), and Argentina (370,000, or 3 percent). Refusal reason. State data indicate that over this time period, 18 percent of adjudicated applications were refused; more than 90 percent were because the applicant did not qualify for the visa sought, and a small percentage (0.05 percent) were due to terrorism and security-related concerns. In 2017, two executive orders and a proclamation issued by the President required, among other actions, visa entry restrictions for nationals of certain listed countries of concern, the development of uniform baseline screening and vetting standards, and changes to NIV screening and vetting procedures. GAO's analysis of State data indicates that, out of the nearly 2.8 million NIV applications refused in fiscal year 2017, 1,338 applications were refused due to visa entry restrictions implemented per the executive actions. State, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and others developed standards for screening and vetting by the U.S. government for all immigration benefits, such as for the requirement for applicants to undergo certain security checks. Further, State sought and received emergency approval from the Office of Management and Budget in May 2017 to develop a new form to collect additional information from some visa applicants, such as email addresses and social media handles."], "all_classes": null, "length": 11506}
{"pred": " The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) collects broadband availability data through the Form 477 process, which is used to assess broadband access on tribal lands. However, the report highlights significant limitations in this data collection method, leading to overstatements of broadband access on tribal lands. The FCC's current approach, which relies on provider-submitted data, does not accurately capture the actual availability, affordability, quality, and service denials that affect broadband access for residents on tribal lands. The report identifies several issues with the Form 477 process, including its lack of granularity, standardized methods for determining coverage areas, and failure to account for factors such as affordability and service quality. These shortcomings result in inaccurate data that can mislead policymakers and limit the effectiveness of federal broadband funding programs aimed at underserved tribal areas. The report also notes that FCC lacks a formal process for obtaining tribal input on the accuracy of provider-submitted data, which could provide critical local insights. To address these issues, the report recommends that the FCC develop targeted data collection methods, establish a formal process for tribal input, and seek feedback on its tribal engagement requirements. These steps would help improve the accuracy of broadband data for tribal lands and ensure that federal funding is effectively targeted to areas in need.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report. Let me start by understanding the main points. The report is about the FCC's broadband data collection methods and their impact on tribal lands. \n\nFirst, the FCC uses Form 477 to collect data on broadband availability. But the report says this method has flaws. It overstates broadband access on tribal lands because it doesn't account for factors like affordability, service quality, and service denials. The data is too granular at the census block level, which can include both tribal and non-tribal areas, leading to inaccuracies. Also, the way providers report coverage areas isn't standardized, so mobile data is unreliable. \n\nThe report mentions that tribal governments and providers are concerned about these inaccuracies. They feel the data doesn't reflect real access issues, like high costs or poor service quality. The FCC's current approach doesn't consider these factors, which are crucial for understanding true broadband access. \n\nThere's also a lack of a formal process for tribes to provide feedback on the data. This means tribes can't correct inaccuracies or share local insights. The report suggests that without better data, federal funding might not reach the most needed areas, and the digital divide might not be addressed properly.\n\nThe recommendations", "answers": ["Broadband furthers economic development, educational attainment, and public health and safety; however, residents of tribal lands have lower levels of broadband access relative to the U.S. population. Congress has prioritized identifying and targeting funds to unserved areas. FCC uses data from broadband providers to develop maps and reports depicting broadband availability in the United States, with specific information on tribal lands. GAO was asked to review FCC's efforts to collect broadband data for tribal lands. This report examines the extent to which: (1) FCC's approach to collecting broadband data accurately captures broadband access on tribal lands and (2) FCC obtains tribal input on the data. GAO interviewed stakeholders from 25 tribal governments or tribally owned providers, and visited nine tribal lands. The selected tribes varied geographically and in levels of broadband availability, among other characteristics. GAO also reviewed FCC's rulemakings on broadband data and interviewed other tribal stakeholders, FCC officials, and 13 non-tribal broadband providers selected to include a diversity of technologies. Provider and tribal interviews were based on non-generalizable samples. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) collects data on broadband availability from providers, but these data do not accurately or completely capture broadband access on tribal lands. Specifically, FCC collects data on broadband availability; these data capture where providers may have broadband infrastructure. However, FCC considers broadband to be “available” for an entire census block if the provider could serve at least one location in the census block. This leads to overstatements of service for specific locations like tribal lands (see figure). FCC, tribal stakeholders, and providers have noted that this approach leads to overstatements of broadband availability. Because FCC uses these data to measure broadband access, it also overstates broadband access—the ability to obtain service—on tribal lands. Additionally, FCC does not collect information on several factors—such as affordability, quality, and denials of service—that FCC and tribal stakeholders stated can affect the extent to which Americans living on tribal lands can access broadband services. FCC provides broadband funding for unserved areas based on its broadband data. Overstatements of access limit FCC's and tribal stakeholders' abilities to target broadband funding to such areas. For example, some tribal officials stated that inaccurate data have affected their ability to plan their own broadband networks and obtain funding to address broadband gaps on their lands. By developing and implementing methods for collecting and reporting accurate and complete data on broadband access specific to tribal lands, FCC would be better able to target federal broadband funding to tribal areas that need it the most and to more accurately assess FCC's progress toward its goal of increasing all Americans' access to affordable broadband. FCC does not have a formal process to obtain tribal input on the accuracy of provider-submitted broadband data. In the National Broadband Plan , FCC highlighted the need for a targeted approach to improve broadband availability data for tribal lands. As outlined in the plan, such an approach would include working with tribes to ensure that information is accurate and useful. About half of the tribal stakeholders GAO interviewed raised concerns that FCC relies solely on data from providers, and most stated FCC should work with tribes to improve the accuracy of FCC's data. Establishing a formal process to obtain input from tribal governments on the accuracy of provider-submitted broadband data could help improve the accuracy of FCC's broadband data for tribal lands.

{"pred": " The report examines the regulatory burden on community banks and credit unions, highlighting the most burdensome regulations and the actions taken by federal regulators to reduce these burdens. Community banks, typically smaller institutions with assets under $10 billion, provide local banking services and engage in relationship banking, which differs from the transactional approach of larger banks. Credit unions, as nonprofit entities, also serve local communities but face similar regulatory challenges. The report identifies three key regulations—Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering (BSA/AML), and Truth-in-Lending Act-Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act Integrated Disclosure (TRID)—as particularly burdensome due to their complexity and compliance costs. These regulations require extensive data reporting, transaction monitoring, and disclosure requirements, which increase operational and staffing costs for smaller institutions. While federal regulators have implemented measures to reduce these burdens, such as adjusting reporting thresholds, improving compliance tools, and streamlining processes, challenges remain. The Dodd-Frank Act and subsequent regulations have introduced additional compliance requirements, some of which have increased costs for community banks and credit unions. However, certain provisions have also reduced costs, such as changes to deposit insurance premiums. The report also discusses the limitations of current regulatory review processes, including the exclusion of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) from the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA) reviews, which affects the assessment of key mortgage-related regulations. Recommendations include enhancing transparency, conducting quantitative analyses, and coordinating regulatory reviews to better address the cumulative burden on smaller institutions. Overall, while efforts have been made to alleviate regulatory burdens, ongoing improvements are needed to ensure compliance is manageable without compromising safety, soundness, and consumer protection.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report. Let me start by understanding the main points. The report is about the regulatory burden on community banks and credit unions in the U.S. It discusses what community banks are, their role, and how they differ from larger banks. Then it goes into the specific regulations that are most burdensome for them, like HMDA, BSA/AML, and TRID. The report also talks about the efforts by federal regulators to reduce these burdens, the challenges they face, and some recommendations.\n\nFirst, I should define community banks and credit unions briefly. Then mention the key regulations that are problematic. Next, explain the impact of these regulations on smaller institutions, including costs and compliance issues. Then, discuss the regulatory responses, like adjustments to reporting thresholds", "answers": ["In recent decades, many new regulations intended to strengthen financial soundness, improve consumer protections, and aid anti-money laundering efforts were implemented for financial institutions. Smaller community banks and credit unions must comply with some of the regulations, but compliance can be more challenging and costly for these institutions. GAO examined (1) the regulations community banks and credit unions viewed as most burdensome and why, and (2) efforts by depository institution regulators to reduce any regulatory burden. GAO analyzed regulations and interviewed more than 60 community banks and credit unions (selected based on asset size and financial activities), regulators, and industry associations and consumer groups. GAO also analyzed letters and transcripts commenting on regulatory burden that regulators prepared responding to the comments. Interviews and focus groups GAO conducted with representatives of over 60 community banks and credit unions indicated regulations for reporting mortgage characteristics, reviewing transactions for potentially illicit activity, and disclosing mortgage terms and costs to consumers were the most burdensome. Institution representatives said these regulations were time-consuming and costly to comply with, in part because the requirements were complex, required individual reports that had to be reviewed for accuracy, or mandated actions within specific timeframes. However, regulators and others noted that the regulations were essential to preventing lending discrimination and use of the banking system for illicit activity, and they were acting to reduce compliance burdens. Institution representatives also said that the new mortgage disclosure regulations increased compliance costs, added significant time to loan closings, and resulted in institutions absorbing costs when others, such as appraisers and inspectors, changed disclosed fees. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued guidance and conducted other outreach to educate institutions after issuing these regulations in 2013. But GAO found that some compliance burdens arose from misunderstanding the disclosure regulations—which in turn may have led institutions to take actions not actually required. Assessing the effectiveness of the guidance for the disclosure regulations could help mitigate the misunderstandings and thus also reduce compliance burdens. Regulators of community banks and credit unions—the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the National Credit Union Administration—conduct decennial reviews to obtain industry comments on regulatory burden. But the reviews, conducted under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 (EGRPRA), had the following limitations: CFPB and the consumer financial regulations for which it is responsible were not included. Unlike executive branch agencies, the depository institution regulators are not required to analyze and report quantitative-based rationales for their responses to comments. Regulators do not assess the cumulative burden of the regulations they administer. CFPB has formed an internal group that will be tasked with reviewing regulations it administers, but the agency has not publicly announced the scope of regulations included, the timing and frequency of the reviews, and the extent to which they will be coordinated with the other federal banking and credit union regulators as part of their periodic EGRPRA reviews. Congressional intent in mandating that these regulators review their regulations was that the cumulative effect of all federal financial regulations be considered. In addition, sound practices required of other federal agencies require them to analyze and report their assessments when reviewing regulations. Documenting in plans how the depository institution regulators would address these EGRPRA limitations would better ensure that all regulations relevant to community banks and credit unions were reviewed, likely improve the analyses the regulators perform, and potentially result in additional burden reduction. GAO makes a total of 10 recommendations to CFPB and the depository institution regulators. CFPB should assess the effectiveness of guidance on mortgage disclosure regulations and publicly issue its plans for the scope and timing of its regulation reviews and coordinate these with the other regulators' review process. As part of their burden reviews, the depository institution regulators should develop plans to report quantitative rationales for their actions and addressing the cumulative burden of regulations. In written comments, CFPB and the four depository institution regulators generally agreed with the recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 18098}

The agency has initiated the Grants Management Modernization (GMM) program to streamline and modernize its grants management processes, aiming to replace 10 legacy systems with a single integrated IT solution. However, the GMM program faces significant challenges in its implementation, including a lack of a reliable schedule, incomplete traceability of IT requirements, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The report highlights that FEMA's decentralized IT environment, with multiple stakeholders and systems, has contributed to inefficiencies and increased risks. Despite efforts to adopt Agile development methods, the program has experienced delays, cost overruns, and issues with data migration. The GMM program has also struggled with documenting and communicating transition plans for legacy systems, leading to uncertainty among stakeholders. Additionally, the agency's cybersecurity practices for the GMM engineering and test environment were found to be insufficient, with gaps in assessing and remediating security controls. The report recommends that FEMA finalize its organizational change management plan, improve traceability of requirements, update its schedule, and enhance cybersecurity practices to ensure the successful delivery of the GMM program. The findings underscore the need for better coordination, clear communication, and adherence to best practices in IT management and cybersecurity to support FEMA's mission of effective disaster response and recovery.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of the given report about FEMA's Grants Management Modernization (GMM) program.

Data migration is a problem, and there's a lack of clear communication about transitioning legacy systems. Cybersecurity is also a concern, with gaps in assessing and fixing security controls. The report gives eight recommendations for FEMA to address these issues.\n\nNow, I need to condense this into a one-page summary. Let me structure it: start with FEMA's mission and the GMM program's goal. Then outline the main challenges—decentralized IT, Agile implementation issues, data migration, communication problems, cybersecurity gaps. Mention the recommendations. Keep it concise", "answers": ["FEMA, a component of DHS, annually awards billions of dollars in grants to help communities prepare for, mitigate the effects of, and recover from major disasters. However, FEMA's complex IT environment supporting grants management consists of many disparate systems. In 2008, the agency attempted to modernize these systems but experienced significant challenges. In 2015, FEMA initiated a new endeavor (the GMM program) aimed at streamlining and modernizing the grants management IT environment. GAO was asked to review the GMM program. GAO's objectives were to (1) determine the extent to which FEMA is implementing leading practices for reengineering its grants management processes and incorporating needs into IT requirements; (2) assess the reliability of the program's estimated costs and schedule; and (3) determine the extent to which FEMA is addressing key cybersecurity practices. GAO compared program documentation to leading practices for process reengineering and requirements management, cost and schedule estimation, and cybersecurity risk management, as established by the Software Engineering Institute, National Institute of Standards and Technology, and GAO. Of six important leading practices for effective business process reengineering and information technology (IT) requirements management, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) fully implemented four and partially implemented two for the Grants Management Modernization (GMM) program (see table). Specifically, FEMA ensured senior leadership commitment, took steps to assess its business environment and performance goals, took recent actions to track progress in delivering IT requirements, and incorporated input from end user stakeholders. However, FEMA has not yet fully established plans for implementing new business processes or established complete traceability of IT requirements. Until FEMA fully implements the remaining two practices, it risks delivering an IT solution that does not fully modernize FEMA's grants management systems. While GMM's initial May 2017 cost estimate of about $251 million was generally consistent with leading practices for a reliable, high-quality estimate, it no longer reflects current assumptions about the program. FEMA officials stated in December 2018 that they had completed a revised cost estimate, but it was undergoing departmental approval. GMM's program schedule was inconsistent with leading practices; of particular concern was that the program's final delivery date of September 2020 was not informed by a realistic assessment of GMM development activities, and rather was determined by imposing an unsubstantiated delivery date. Developing sound cost and schedule estimates is necessary to ensure that FEMA has a clear understanding of program risks. Of five key cybersecurity practices, FEMA fully addressed three and partially addressed two for GMM. Specifically, it categorized GMM's system based on security risk, selected and implemented security controls, and monitored security controls on an ongoing basis. However, the program had not initially established corrective action plans for 13 medium- and low-risk vulnerabilities. This conflicts with the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) guidance that specifies that corrective action plans must be developed for every weakness identified. Until FEMA, among other things, ensures that the program consistently follows the department's guidance on preparing corrective action plans for all security vulnerabilities, GMM's system will remain at increased risk of exploits.

{"pred": " The Clean Water Act (CWA) and the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) have been central to funding municipal wastewater and drinking water infrastructure in the United States. The CWA, established in 1972, initially provided federal grants to states for wastewater treatment plant construction, with the federal share initially at 75% and later reduced to 55%. By the 1980s, debates arose over the federal role in funding such projects, leading to the 1987 Water Quality Act, which introduced the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) program. This program shifted from direct federal grants to a loan system, with states managing funds to support wastewater infrastructure. The CWSRF was phased in, replacing the Title II grants program by 1991, and aimed to promote state self-sufficiency. \n\nThe SDWA, enacted in 1974, initially focused on drinking water regulations, but by the 1990s, concerns grew about the financial burden on small communities to meet new standards. The 1996 SDWA Amendments established the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) to help communities comply with regulations. Both CWSRF and DWSRF programs allow for additional subsidies to assist disadvantaged communities. \n\nOver the years, federal funding for these programs has fluctuated, with significant appropriations and reauthorizations. The American Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 reauthorized funding for both CWSRF and DWSRF, with increased allocations for specific projects like lead reduction and water testing. Despite these efforts, funding needs remain high, with estimates indicating a need for $271 billion for wastewater and $473 billion for drinking water projects over the next two decades. \n\nCongress has continued to appropriate funds, though debates over federal versus state roles and the impact of earmarking have shaped the programs. The introduction of the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) in 2014 added another layer of support, allowing for loans and subsidies to enhance infrastructure projects. \n\nRecent administrations have proposed budget cuts, but Congress has generally maintained funding levels, recognizing the critical need for water infrastructure investment. The ongoing challenge is to balance federal support with state and local responsibilities, ensuring sustainable and equitable access to clean water and wastewater services across the nation.\nThe Clean Water Act (CWA) and the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) have been pivotal in funding municipal wastewater and drinking water infrastructure in the", "answers": ["The principal federal program to aid municipal wastewater treatment plant construction is authorized in the Clean Water Act (CWA). Established as a grant program in 1972, it now capitalizes state loan programs through the clean water state revolving loan fund (CWSRF) program. Since FY1972, appropriations have totaled $98 billion. In 1996, Congress amended the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA, P.L. 104-182) to authorize a similar state loan program for drinking water to help systems finance projects needed to comply with drinking water regulations and to protect public health. Since FY1997, appropriations for the drinking water state revolving loan fund (DWSRF) program have totaled $23 billion. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administers both SRF programs, which annually distribute funds to the states for implementation. Funding amounts are specified in the State and Tribal Assistance Grants (STAG) account of EPA annual appropriations acts. The combined appropriations for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure assistance have represented 25%-32% of total funds appropriated to EPA in recent years. Prior to CWA amendments in 1987 (P.L. 100-4), Congress provided wastewater grant funding directly to municipalities. The federal share of project costs was generally 55%; state and local governments were responsible for the remaining 45%. The 1987 amendments replaced this grant program with the SRF program. Local communities are now often responsible for 100% of project costs, rather than 45%, as they are required to repay loans to states. The greater financial burden of the act's loan program on some cities has caused some to seek continued grant funding. Although the CWSRF and DWSRF have largely functioned as loan programs, both allow the implementing state agency to provide \"additional subsidization\" under certain conditions. Since its amendments in 1996, the SDWA has authorized states to use up to 30% of their DWSRF capitalization grants to provide additional assistance, such as forgiveness of loan principal or negative interest rate loans, to help disadvantaged communities. America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 (AWIA; P.L. 115-270) increased this proportion to 35% while conditionally requiring states to use at least 6% of their capitalization grants for these purposes. Congress amended the CWA in 2014, adding similar provisions to the CWSRF program. In addition, appropriations acts in recent years have required states to use minimum percentages of their allotted SRF grants to provide additional subsidization. Final full-year appropriations were enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2019 (P.L. 116-6), on February 15, 2019. The act provided $1.694 billion for the CWSRF and $1.163 billion for the DWSRF program, nearly identical to the FY2018 appropriations. The FY0219 act provided $68 million for the WIFIA program, a $5 million increase from the FY2018 appropriation.

However, the report acknowledges that these differences could stem from various factors, not necessarily gender bias. The analysis also reviews studies on credit and housing markets, noting that while some research suggests women may pay higher interest rates on mortgages and face higher denial rates for small business loans, these disparities often disappear when controlling for creditworthiness and other factors. Federal agencies like the FTC, BCFP, and HUD monitor complaints but have received few regarding gender-based pricing. State and local laws in California, Miami-Dade County, and New York City prohibit gender-based price discrimination.

Let me start by understanding the main points. The report looks at gender-based pricing differences in consumer products, especially personal care items like deodorants and razors. It found that in some cases, women's products are priced higher than men's, but the reasons aren't clear—could be due to costs, preferences, or bias. They also checked other markets like credit and housing, where some studies show women might face higher rates or denial rates, but these often even out when considering other factors.

Also note that the report doesn't conclusively prove bias, just identifies possible factors. Alright, let me put that together.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of the report. Let me start by understanding", "answers": ["Gender-related price differences occur when consumers are charged different prices for the same or similar goods and services because of factors related to gender. While variation in costs and consumer demand may give rise to such price differences, some policymakers have raised concerns that gender bias may also be a factor. While the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Fair Housing Act prohibit discrimination based on sex in credit and housing transactions, no federal law prohibits businesses from charging consumers different prices for the same or similar goods targeted to different genders. GAO was asked to review gender-related price differences for consumer goods and services sold in the United States. This report examines, among other things, (1) how prices compared for selected goods and services marketed to men and women, and potential reasons for any price differences; (2) what is known about price differences for men and women for products not differentiated by gender, such as mortgages; and (3) the extent to which federal agencies have identified and addressed any concerns about gender-related price differences. To examine these issues, GAO analyzed retail price data, reviewed relevant academic studies, analyzed federal consumer complaint data, and interviewed federal agency officials, industry experts, and academics. Firms differentiate many consumer products to appeal separately to men and women by slightly altering product attributes like color or scent. Products differentiated by gender may sell for different prices if men and women have different demands or willingness to pay for these product attributes. Of 10 personal care product categories (e.g., deodorants and shaving products) that GAO analyzed, average retail prices paid were significantly higher for women's products than for men's in 5 categories. In 2 categories—shaving gel and nondisposable razors—men's versions sold at a significantly higher price. One category—razor blades--had mixed results based on two price measures analyzed, and two others—disposable razors and mass-market perfumes—showed no significant gender price differences. GAO found that the target gender for a product is a significant factor contributing to price differences identified, but GAO did not have sufficient information to determine the extent to which these gender-related price differences were due to gender bias as opposed to other factors, such as different advertising costs. Though the analysis controlled for several observable product attributes, such as product size and packaging type, all underlying differences in costs and demand for products targeted to different genders could not be fully observed. Studies GAO reviewed found limited evidence of gender price differences for four products or services not differentiated by gender—mortgages, small business credit, auto purchases, and auto repairs. For example, with regard to mortgages, women as a group paid higher average mortgage rates than men, in part due to weaker credit characteristics, such as lower average income. However, after controlling for borrower credit characteristics and other factors, three studies did not find statistically significant differences in borrowing costs between men and women, while one found women paid higher rates for certain subprime loans. In addition, one study found that female borrowers defaulted less frequently than male borrowers with similar credit characteristics, and the study suggested that women may pay higher mortgage rates than men relative to their default risk. While these studies controlled for factors other than gender that could affect borrowing costs, several lacked important data on certain borrower risk characteristics, such as credit scores, which could affect analysis of gender disparities. Also, several studies analyzed small samples of subprime loans that were originated in 2005 or earlier, which limits the generalizability of the results. In their oversight of federal antidiscrimination statutes, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, Federal Trade Commission, and Department of Housing and Urban Development have identified limited consumer concerns based on gender-related pricing differences.

{"pred": " The report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) evaluates the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) dam safety oversight approach, focusing on its inspection processes, engineering studies, and relicensing procedures. It highlights that FERC oversees approximately 1,000 non-federal hydropower projects, which account for about 8% of the U.S. electric generating capacity. FERC's oversight includes inspections, engineering studies, and relicensing reviews to ensure dam safety. The report finds that while FERC generally conducts inspections and reviews in line with its guidelines, there are inconsistencies in how inspection data is recorded and analyzed across its regional offices. FERC uses multiple systems, such as DAMS and OEP-IT, which lack standardization, making it difficult to analyze data at a national level. The report recommends that FERC establish standard procedures for recording inspection data to improve consistency and enable portfolio-wide risk analysis. Additionally, the report suggests that FERC should use inspection data to assess safety risks across its entire portfolio of dams to identify and prioritize risks nationally. The report also notes that FERC's approach to evaluating engineering studies is flexible, allowing for professional judgment, but the lack of standardized data collection hampers comprehensive risk assessment. During relicensing, FERC reviews safety information, but the extent of review varies, particularly for low hazard dams. The report recommends enhancing FERC's ability to analyze common safety deficiencies across its portfolio to proactively address risks. FERC officials acknowledged the need for improvements and stated they plan to implement the recommendations, including developing a new system to better track safety information. The report concludes that while FERC's current approach is effective in many aspects, standardizing data collection and analysis would enhance its ability to manage dam safety risks across its regulated dams.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report. Let me start by understanding the main points. The report is about FERC's dam safety oversight. The GAO evaluated how FERC collects and analyzes data from inspections, evaluates engineering studies, and reviews dam safety during relicensing. \n\nFirst, the report mentions that there are around 90,500 dams in the US, with about 2,100 associated with hydropower. FERC oversees about 1,000 non-federal projects, which make up 8% of the country's electric capacity. They do inspections, require engineering studies, and handle relicensing. \n\nThe key findings are that FERC's inspection data is inconsistent because they", "answers": ["In February 2017, components of California's Oroville Dam failed, leading to the evacuation of nearly 200,000 nearby residents.

FERC issues and renews licenses—which can last up to 50 years—to dam operators and promotes safe dam operation by conducting safety inspections and reviewing technical engineering studies, among other actions. GAO was asked to review FERC's approach to overseeing dam safety. This report examines: (1) how FERC collects information from its dam safety inspections and the extent of its analysis, and (2) how FERC evaluates engineering studies of dam performance to analyze safety, among other objectives. GAO analyzed documentation on a non-generalizable sample of 42 dams associated with projects relicensed from fiscal years 2014 through 2017, selected based on geography and hazard classifications, among other factors. GAO also reviewed FERC regulations and documents; and interviewed FERC staff associated with the selected projects and technical consultants, selected based on the frequency and timing of their reviews. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) staff generally followed established guidance in collecting safety information from dam inspections for the dams GAO reviewed, but FERC has not used this information to analyze dam safety portfolio-wide. For these 42 dams, GAO found that FERC staff generally followed guidance in collecting safety information during inspections of individual dams and key structures associated with those dams. (See figure.) However, FERC lacks standard procedures that specify how and where staff should record safety deficiencies identified. As a result, FERC staff use multiple systems to record inspection findings, thereby creating information that cannot be easily analyzed. Further, while FERC officials said inspections help oversee individual dam's safety, FERC has not analyzed this information to identify any safety risks across its portfolio. GAO's prior work has highlighted the importance of evaluating risks across a portfolio. FERC officials stated that they have not conducted portfolio-wide analyses because officials prioritize the individual dam inspections and response to urgent dam safety incidents. However, following the Oroville incident, a FERC-led initiative to examine dam structures comparable to those at Oroville identified 27 dam spillways with varying degrees of safety concerns, on which FERC officials stated they are working with dam licensees to address. A similar and proactive portfolio-wide approach, based on analysis of common inspection deficiencies across the portfolio of dams under FERC's authority, could help FERC identify safety risks prior to a safety incident. Guidelines recognize that each dam is unique and allow for flexibility and exemptions in its use. FERC staff use the studies to inform other components of their safety approach, including the analysis of dam failure scenarios and their review of safety to determine whether to renew a license. GAO recommends that FERC: (1) develop standard procedures for recording information collected as part of its inspections, and (2) use inspection information to assess safety risks across FERC's portfolio of dams.

The programs offer financial support in the form of cash reimbursements, commodity foods, and administrative assistance, with eligibility and funding rules varying by program. \n\nThe NSLP and SBP provide meals to students in schools, with eligibility based on household income, categorical eligibility (such as participation in SNAP or TANF), or the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP). These programs have updated nutrition standards to align with dietary guidelines, and they offer higher subsidies for meals served to low-income children. The CACFP supports meals and snacks in child care settings, after-school programs, and other non-school environments, with eligibility and reimbursement rates based on income and program-specific criteria. The SFSP provides meals during the summer months, while the SMP offers milk to children, often at subsidized rates. \n\nThe programs are administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service (USDA-FNS), with states and local providers playing key roles in implementation. Funding is primarily through annual appropriations, with some mandatory funding sources, and the programs are subject to periodic reauthorization by Congress. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA) introduced significant changes, including updated nutrition standards, expanded eligibility, and new initiatives like the Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer (SEBTC) program. \n\nThe programs serve millions of children annually, with the NSLP being the largest, providing over 4.9 billion lunches in FY2017.

The goal is to improve", "answers": ["The \"child nutrition programs\" refer to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service (USDA-FNS) programs that provide food for children in school or institutional settings. The best known programs, which serve the largest number of children, are the school meals programs: the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and the School Breakfast Program (SBP). The child nutrition programs also include the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), which provides meals and snacks in day care and after school settings; the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP), which provides food during the summer months; the Special Milk Program (SMP), which supports milk for schools that do not participate in NSLP or SBP; and the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP), which funds fruit and vegetable snacks in select elementary schools. Funding: The vast majority of the child nutrition programs account is considered mandatory spending, with trace amounts of discretionary funding for certain related activities. Referred to as open-ended, \"appropriated entitlements,\" funding is provided through the annual appropriations process; however, the level of spending is controlled by benefit and eligibility criteria in federal law and dependent on the resulting levels of participation. Federal cash funding (in the form of per-meal reimbursements) and USDA commodity food support is guaranteed to schools and other providers based on the number of meals or snacks served and participant category (e.g., free meals for poor children get higher subsidies). Participation: The child nutrition programs serve children of varying ages and in different institutional settings. The NSLP and SBP have the broadest reach, serving qualifying children of all ages in school settings. Other child nutrition programs serve more-narrow populations. CACFP, for example, provides meals and snacks to children in early childhood and after-school settings among other venues. Programs generally provide some subsidy for all food served but a larger federal reimbursement for food served to children from low-income households. Administration: Responsibility for child nutrition programs is divided between the federal government, states, and localities. The state agency and type of local provider differs by program. In the NSLP and SBP, schools and school districts (\"school food authorities\") administer the program. Meanwhile, SFSP (and sometimes CACFP) uses a model in which sponsor organizations handle administrative responsibilities for a number of sites that serve meals. Reauthorization: The underlying laws covering the child nutrition programs were last reauthorized in the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA, P.L. 111-296, enacted December 13, 2010). This law made significant changes to child nutrition programs, including increasing federal financing for school lunches, expanding access to community eligibility and direct certification options for schools, and expanding eligibility options for home child care providers. The law also required an update to school meal nutrition guidelines as well as new guidelines for food served outside the meal programs (e.g., snacks sold in vending machines and cafeteria a la carte lines). Current Issues: The 114th Congress began but did not complete a 2016 child nutrition reauthorization, and there was no significant legislative activity with regard to reauthorization in the 115th Congress.

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report discusses the federal government's program for paying benefits to coal miners with black lung disease (CWP) and other lung diseases when the mine operators can't pay. The main funding source is an excise tax on coal. The tax rates were reduced in 2019, which is causing financial strain on the trust fund. The trust fund sometimes borrows from the general fund when the tax isn't enough. There's also a mention of the decline in coal production and increased CWP cases contributing to the problem.

In 2019, the monthly benefit for a miner with no dependents is $660.10. Benefits can be as much as $1,320.10 per month for miners with three or more dependents. Medical benefits are provided separately from disability benefits. Benefit payments and related administrative expenses in cases in which the responsible operators do not pay are paid out of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. The primary source of revenue for the trust fund is an excise tax on coal produced and sold domestically. If excise tax revenue is not sufficient to finance Black Lung Program benefits, the trust fund may borrow from the general fund of the Treasury. For 2018, the tax rates on coal were $1.10 per ton of underground-mined coal or $0.55 per ton of surface-mined coal, limited to 4.4% of the sales price. These rates were established in 1986. Starting in 2019, under current law, these tax rates are $0.50 per ton of underground-mined coal or $0.25 per ton of surface-mined coal, limited to 2% of the sales price. These are the rates that were set when the trust fund was established in 1977. The decline in the excise tax rates will likely put additional financial strain on a trust fund that already borrows from the general fund to meet obligations. The decline in domestic coal production, recent increases in the rate of CWP, and bankruptcies in the coal sector also contribute to the financial strain on the trust fund. The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund and associated excise tax on coal were established so that the coal industry, as opposed to taxpayers in general, would bear the burden associated with providing black lung benefits. Throughout its history, the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund has not raised revenues sufficient to meet obligations. As a result, at various points in time, Congress and the President have acted to increase the excise tax on coal, forgive or refinance trust fund debt, and modify black lung benefits eligibility. With the rate of the excise tax on coal reduced in 2019, the 116th Congress may again evaluate options for improving the fiscal condition of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, or other issues related to providing federal benefits to miners with black lung disease."], "all_classes": null, "length": 7218}

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nFirst, the report explains that Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory with 3.3 million residents. It's subject to federal laws but has some exemptions. For example, residents don't pay federal income tax on Puerto Rico income but do on income from outside. They also have different tax credits and federal programs. The economy has been in decline since 2005, with GDP dropping over 9% and population decreasing by 12.8% since 2004. Unemployment rates are high, and the labor force has shrunk. The government has been in deficit since 2002, leading to significant debt. By 2014, public debt was 66% of GDP, and they defaulted on $1.5 billion in debt. PROMESA was enacted in 2016 to manage the crisis, creating a financial oversight board. The report also discusses factors contributing to the debt, like persistent deficits, reliance on debt for operations, and the triple tax exemption on municipal bonds. It mentions federal actions that could help, such as improving disclosure requirements, applying investor protections, and removing the tax exemption.

Let me start drafting each section, keeping paragraphs short and to the point.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of the report. Let me start by outlining the key points. The report discusses Puerto Rico's status as a U.S. territory, its economic challenges, debt issues, factors contributing to the crisis", "answers": ["Puerto Rico has roughly $70 billion in outstanding debt and $50 billion in unfunded pension liabilities and since August 2015 has defaulted on over $1.5 billion in debt. The effects of Hurricanes Irma and Maria will further affect Puerto Rico's ability to repay its debt, as well as its economic condition. In response to Puerto Rico's fiscal crisis, Congress passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Security Act (PROMESA) in 2016, which included a provision for GAO to review Puerto Rico's debt. This report describes the factors that contributed to Puerto Rico's financial condition and levels of debt and federal actions that could address these factors. Consistent with PROMESA, GAO focused on actions that would not increase the federal deficit. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials from the Puerto Rico and federal governments and conducted a review of relevant literature. GAO also interviewed former Puerto Rico officials and experts in Puerto Rico's economy, the municipal securities markets, and state and territorial budgeting, financial management, and debt practices, as well as officials from the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico (created by PROMESA). GAO is not making recommendations based on the federal actions identified because policymakers would need to consider challenges and tradeoffs related to implementation. The Puerto Rico government generally agreed with the factors we identified and provided additional information. GAO incorporated technical comments from SEC as appropriate. The factors that contributed to Puerto Rico's financial condition and levels of debt relate to (1) the Puerto Rico government running persistent annual deficits—where expenses exceed revenues—and (2) its use of debt to cope with deficits. Based on a literature review and interviews with current and former Puerto Rico officials, federal officials, and other relevant experts, GAO identified factors that contributed to Puerto Rico's persistent deficits: The Puerto Rico government's inadequate financial management and oversight practices. For example, the Puerto Rico government frequently overestimated the amount of revenue it would collect and Puerto Rico's agencies regularly spent more than the amounts Puerto Rico's legislature appropriated for a given fiscal year. Policy decisions by Puerto Rico's government. For example, Puerto Rico borrowed funds to balance budgets and insufficiently addressed public pension funding shortfalls. Puerto Rico's prolonged economic contraction. Examples of factors contributing to the contraction include outmigration and the resulting diminished labor force, and the high cost of importing goods and energy. Additional factors enabled Puerto Rico to use debt to finance its deficits, such as high demand for Puerto Rico debt. One cause of high demand was that under federal law, income from Puerto Rico bonds generally receives more favorable tax treatment than income from bonds issued by states and their localities. Based on an assessment of relevant literature and input from current and former Puerto Rico officials, federal officials, and other relevant experts, GAO identified three potential federal actions that may help address some of these factors. GAO also identified considerations for policymakers related to these actions. Modify the tax exempt status for Puerto Rico municipal debt. Making interest income from Puerto Rico bonds earned by investors residing outside of Puerto Rico subject to applicable state and local taxes could lower demand for Puerto Rico debt. However, reduced demand could hinder Puerto Rico's ability to borrow funds for capital investments or liquidity. Apply federal investor protection laws to Puerto Rico. Requiring Puerto Rico investment companies to disclose risks with Puerto Rico bonds and adhere to other requirements could lower demand for the bonds. However, this action could also limit Puerto Rico's ability to borrow funds. Modify the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) authority over municipal bond disclosure requirements. SEC could be allowed to require timely disclosure of materials—such as audited financial statements—associated with municipal bonds. Over the past decade, Puerto Rico often failed to provide timely audited financial statements related to its municipal bonds. Timely disclosure could help investors make informed decisions about investing in municipal bonds. However, a broad requirement could place additional burdens on all U.S. municipal issuers, such as the costs of standardizing reporting."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6356}

The report also outlines CMS's Center for Program Integrity (CPI), which leads antifraud efforts, and its use of tools like the Fraud Prevention System (FPS) and Unified Program Integrity Contractors (UPIC). Despite these efforts, the report identifies gaps, such as the lack of a comprehensive fraud risk assessment and a documented risk-based antifraud strategy.

GAO has designated the two largest programs, Medicare and Medicaid, as high risk partly due to their vulnerability to fraud, waste, and abuse. In fiscal year 2016, improper payment estimates for these programs totaled about $95 billion. GAO's Fraud Risk Framework and the subsequent enactment of the Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015 have called attention to the importance of federal agencies' antifraud efforts. This report examines (1) CMS's approach for managing fraud risks across its four principal programs, and (2) how CMS's efforts managing fraud risks in Medicare and Medicaid align with the Fraud Risk Framework. GAO reviewed laws and regulations and HHS and CMS documents, such as program-integrity manuals. It also interviewed CMS officials and a sample of CMS stakeholders, including state officials and contractors. GAO selected states based on fraud risk and other factors, such as geographic diversity. GAO selected contractors based on a mix of companies and geographic areas served. The approach that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has taken for managing fraud risks across its four principal programs—Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the health-insurance marketplaces—is incorporated into its broader program-integrity approach. According to CMS officials, this broader program-integrity approach can help the agency develop control activities to address multiple sources of improper payments, including fraud. As the figure below shows, CMS views fraud as part of a spectrum of actions that may result in improper payments. CMS's efforts managing fraud risks in Medicare and Medicaid partially align with GAO's 2015 A Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs (Fraud Risk Framework). This framework describes leading practices in four components: commit , assess , design and implement , and evaluate and adapt . CMS has shown commitment to combating fraud in part by establishing a dedicated entity—the Center for Program Integrity—to lead antifraud efforts. Furthermore, CMS is offering and requiring antifraud training for stakeholder groups such as providers, beneficiaries, and health-insurance plans. However, CMS does not require fraud-awareness training on a regular basis for employees, a practice that the framework identifies as a way agencies can help create a culture of integrity and compliance. Regarding the assess and design and implement components, CMS has taken steps to identify fraud risks, such as by designating specific provider types as high risk and developing associated control activities. However, it has not conducted a fraud risk assessment for Medicare or Medicaid, and has not designed and implemented a risk-based antifraud strategy. A fraud risk assessment allows managers to fully consider fraud risks to their programs, analyze their likelihood and impact, and prioritize risks. Managers can then design and implement a strategy with specific control activities to mitigate these fraud risks, as well as an appropriate evaluation approach consistent with the evaluate and adapt component. By developing a fraud risk assessment and using that assessment to create an antifraud strategy and evaluation approach, CMS could better ensure that it is addressing the full portfolio of risks and strategically targeting the most-significant fraud risks facing Medicare and Medicaid.

{"pred": " The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) administers the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program, which aims to preserve affordable housing by converting public housing units to project-based Section 8 vouchers (PBV) or project-based rental assistance (PBRA). Authorized in 2011 and expanded through 2017, the program allows public housing authorities (PHAs) to convert units to long-term contracts, enabling access to private and public funding sources like LIHTC, mortgages, and operating reserves. The RAD program has been instrumental in addressing capital needs and improving the physical condition of public housing. As of September 2017, 689 conversions involving 74,709 units had been completed, with 706 conversions in progress. The program's success is measured by its ability to leverage private capital, with a reported leverage ratio of 19:1 in 2017. However, HUD's methodology for calculating this ratio has been criticized for including public funds as private sources and not accounting for all financial data accurately. The report highlights that HUD's leverage ratio calculations may overstate private-sector leveraging, as they include federal and public funding sources. Additionally, HUD has not fully developed post-conversion monitoring procedures to ensure long-term affordability and compliance with resident safeguards. The report also notes that while RAD conversions have improved living conditions for many residents, there are concerns about communication, relocation processes, and the adequacy of resident protections. HUD has taken steps to improve oversight, including implementing completion certification procedures and revising data collection methods, but challenges remain in ensuring consistent and accurate reporting of financial outcomes and resident impacts. The report recommends that HUD enhance post-conversion monitoring, improve leverage metrics, and develop procedures to assess risks to unit affordability. Overall, the RAD program has made significant strides in preserving affordable housing, but ongoing improvements are needed to ensure its effectiveness and accountability.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of the given report about the RAD program. Let me start by understanding the key points from the report. \n\nFirst, the RAD program was authorized in 2011 and expanded through 2017. It allows PHAs to convert public housing units to Section 8 vouchers or PBRA, using long-term contracts. The goal is to preserve affordability and improve housing conditions. The program has a cap of 225,000 units, which was fully subscribed by 2017. \n\nThe report mentions that RAD conversions involve", "answers": ["HUD administers the Public Housing program, which provides federally assisted rental units to low-income households through PHAs. In 2010, HUD estimated its aging public housing stock had $25.6 billion in unmet capital needs. To help address these needs, the RAD program was authorized in fiscal year 2012. RAD allows PHAs to move (convert) properties in the public housing program to Section 8 rental assistance programs, and retain property ownership or transfer it to other entities. The conversion enables PHAs to access additional funding, including investor equity, generally not available for public housing properties. GAO was asked to review public housing conversions under RAD and any impact on residents. This report addresses, among other objectives, HUD's (1) assessment of conversion outcomes; (2) oversight of resident safeguards; and (3) provisions to help preserve the long-term affordability of units. GAO analyzed data on RAD conversions through fiscal year 2017; reviewed a sample of randomly selected, nongeneralizable RAD property files; and interviewed HUD officials, PHAs, developers, academics, and affected residents. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) put procedures in place to evaluate and monitor the impact of conversion of public housing properties under the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program. RAD's authorizing legislation requires HUD to assess and publish findings about the amount of private-sector leveraging. HUD uses a variety of metrics to measure conversion outcomes. But, the metric HUD uses to measure private-sector leveraging—the share of private versus public funding for construction or rehabilitation of assisted housing—has limitations. For example, HUD's leveraging ratio counts some public resources as leveraged private-sector investment and does not use final (post-completion) data. As a result, HUD's ability to accurately assess private-sector leveraging is limited. HUD does not systematically use its data systems to track effects of RAD conversions on resident households (such as changes in rent and income, or relocation) or monitor use of all resident safeguards. Rather, since 2016, HUD has required public housing agencies (PHA) or other post-conversion owners to maintain resident logs and collect such information. But the resident logs do not contain historical program information. HUD has not developed a process for systematically reviewing information from its data systems and resident logs on an ongoing basis. HUD has been developing procedures to monitor compliance with some resident safeguards—such as the right to return to a converted property—and begun a limited review of compliance with these safeguards. However, HUD has not yet developed a process for monitoring other safeguards—such as access to other housing voucher options. Federal internal control standards require agencies to use quality information to achieve objectives, and obtain and evaluate relevant and reliable data in a timely manner for use in effective monitoring. Without a comprehensive review of household information and procedures for fully monitoring all resident safeguards, HUD cannot fully assess the effects of RAD on residents. RAD authorizing legislation and the program's use agreements (contracts with property owners) contain provisions intended to help ensure the long-term availability of affordable units, but the provisions have not been tested in situations such as foreclosure. For example, use agreements between HUD and property owners specify affordability and use restrictions that according to the contract would survive a default or foreclosure. HUD officials stated that HUD intends to develop procedures to identify and respond to risks to long-term affordability, including default or foreclosure in RAD properties. However, HUD has not yet done so. According to federal internal control standards, agencies should identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving goals and objectives. Procedures that address oversight of affordability requirements would better position HUD to help ensure RAD conversions comply with program requirements, detect potential foreclosure and other risks, and take corrective actions. GAO makes five recommendations to HUD intended to improve leveraging metrics, monitoring of the use and enforcement of resident safeguards, and compliance with RAD requirements. HUD agreed with our recommendations to improve metrics and build on existing oversight."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12616}

The report also looks at inventory data from 20 agencies, showing they own over 136,000 items, mostly by DOD. There's a focus on the cost and utilization of this equipment, with some agencies spending billions. \n\nThe report highlights the lack of a standard definition for heavy equipment and the absence of centralized reporting requirements. It points out that agencies should conduct lease-versus-purchase analyses as per the FAR, but many didn't document these analyses, leading to potential inefficiencies. The Air Force, FWS, and NPS were studied, and it was found that they didn't consistently follow the guidelines. Recommendations are made for clearer guidance on when to perform these analyses.\n\nI need to condense all this into a concise summary. Start with the purpose of the report, then the key findings about acquisition methods, inventory data, utilization, and the lease-versus-purchase analyses. Mention the recommendations. Keep it to one page, so around 300-400 words. Avoid jargon, make it clear and structured. Check for any important numbers or percentages that should be included, like the 136,000 items, DOD's share, the $7.4 billion spent, and the recommendations. Also note the lack of standard definitions and reporting requirements. Make sure to highlight the main issues: inconsistent documentation of analyses, potential overspending, and the need for clearer guidelines. Conclude with the recommendations to the Air Force and Interior. Alright, let me put this together in a coherent way.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of the report. Let me start by identifying the key points. The report discusses how federal agencies acquire heavy equipment, either through purchase or lease, often via GSA.

GAO was asked to review federal agencies' management of heavy equipment. This report, among other objectives, examines: (1) the number, type, and costs of heavy equipment items that are owned by 20 federal agencies and (2) the heavy equipment that selected agencies recently acquired as well as how they decided whether to purchase or lease this equipment. GAO collected heavy equipment inventory data as of June 2017 from the 24 agencies that have chief financial officers responsible for overseeing financial management. GAO also selected three agencies (using factors such as the heavy equipment fleet's size) and reviewed their acquisitions of and guidance on heavy equipment. These agencies' practices are not generalizable to all acquisitions but provide insight into what efforts these agencies take to acquire thousands of heavy equipment items. GAO also interviewed officials at the three selected agencies. Of the 24 agencies GAO reviewed, 20 reported owning over 136,000 heavy equipment items such as cranes, backhoes, and forklifts, and spending over $7.4 billion (in 2016 dollars) to acquire this equipment. The remaining 4 agencies reported that they do not own any heavy equipment. The three selected agencies GAO reviewed in-depth—the Air Force within the Department of Defense (DOD), and the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service within the Department of the Interior (Interior)—spent about $360 million to purchase about 3,500 heavy equipment assets in calendar years 2012 through 2016 and over $5 million to lease heavy equipment from fiscal years 2012 through 2016. Officials from all three agencies stated that they consider mission needs and the availability of equipment leases when deciding whether to lease or purchase heavy equipment. Federal regulations provide that agencies should consider whether it is more economical to lease or purchase equipment when acquiring heavy equipment, and federal internal control standards require that management clearly document all transactions in a manner that allows the documentation to be readily available for examination. However, in reviewing selected leases and purchases of heavy equipment from these three agencies, GAO found that officials did not consistently conduct or document lease-versus-purchase analyses. Officials at the Air Force and Interior said that there was a lack of clarity in agency policies about when they were required to conduct and document such analyses. Without greater clarity on when lease-versus-purchase analyses should be conducted and documented, these agencies may not be spending funds on heavy equipment effectively. The Department of the Interior and the Air Force should clarify the circumstances in which lease-versus-purchases analyses for heavy equipment acquisitions are to be conducted and documented. The Departments of the Interior and Defense concurred with these recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6750}

Let me start by reading through the report to understand the main points. \n\nThe report is about the Department of Defense (DOD) workforce changes since 2001. It mentions that the military, civilian, and contractor workforces peaked around 2011 and have been decreasing since. Factors include involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan, conversions between military and civilian roles, contractor insourcing, and growth in areas like acquisition and cyber. \n\nThe report also discusses the legal framework governing DOD workforce management, like sections 129, 129a, and 2463 of Title 10. There's a mention of DOD Instruction 1100.22 which outlines policies for determining the workforce mix. The DOD has been trying to compare the costs of military, civilian, and contractor personnel, but there are challenges in accurately accounting for all costs, especially non-labor ones like overhead and benefits. \n\nThe Cost-Comparison Report from 2015 looked at 21,000 civilians and contractors, finding that costs varied by function, location, and expertise. However, the report excluded some non-labor costs, which the report's authors argue didn't fully meet the congressional mandate. DOD didn't include facility overhead and other indirect costs, even though the mandate required a full cost accounting. \n\nThere's also a part about flexible hiring authorities for civilians, where DOD found variations in their use and suggested possible refinements. The report concludes that DOD partially addressed the mandate because they didn't include all costs, and there's a need for better data and methodologies to improve workforce management and cost comparisons.\n\nNow, I need to condense this into a one-page summary. I should start with the main findings: workforce trends, legal framework, cost comparison efforts, challenges in cost accounting, and recommendations. I need to mention the key points about the exclusion of non-labor costs and the partial compliance with the congressional mandate. Also, include the part about the flexible hiring authorities and the need for better data. Make sure to keep it concise, double-spaced, with proper margins.

In the Senate Report 114-49 accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 included a provision for DOD to issue a report (1) assessing functions performed by federal civilian and service contractor personnel, (2) accounting for the full costs of federal civilian and service contractor personnel performing these functions, (3) comparing these costs, and (4) assessing available hiring and retention authorities for federal civilians. The Senate report also included a provision for GAO to assess DOD's report, which DOD submitted to Congress in April 2017. This report examines the extent to which DOD's report addressed the prescribed congressional elements. GAO reviewed DOD's report and compared it to the prescribed elements, examined documents relevant to DOD's cost estimating and comparison methodology, and interviewed DOD officials, including those in its Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation responsible for the calculations in DOD's report. In response to Congressional direction, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a report in April 2017 comparing the costs of federal civilian and service contractor personnel at select installations. The report addressed three out of four provision elements and partially addressed one, as discussed below. DOD concluded that neither federal civilians nor service contractors were predominately more or less expensive, with costs being dependent on position, location, and level of seniority. DOD noted that it used a non-probability based sample of personnel for its report, and the results are not generalizable. An assessment of performance of functions being performed by federal civilian and service contractor personnel at six military installations, with four being in the continental United States and two being outside the continental United States. GAO believes that DOD addressed this requirement because it developed a methodology to assess performance of functions performed by federal civilians and service contractors at 17 organizations within nine geographic regions including two locations outside the continental United States. DOD used data from the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System to identify military installations with large reported numbers of federal civilians. DOD determined that personnel need to perform at least 80 percent common tasks to be able to make a comparison. An accounting of the fully-burdened, or full, cost of federal civilian and service contractor personnel performing functions at the selected installations including training, benefits, reimbursable costs, and facility overhead. GAO believes that DOD partially addressed this requirement because while it calculated the labor costs of selected federal civilian and service contractor full-time equivalents performing similar functions for organizations at government-owned facilities, it excluded certain non-labor costs from its calculations. A comparison of the costs of performance of these functions by federal civilians and service contractor personnel at the selected installations. GAO believes that DOD addressed this requirement because it compared calculated costs for selected federal civilians and service contractors performing similar functions at selected installations and included those comparisons in its report. An assessment of the flexible employment authorities for the employment and retention of federal civilian employees. GAO believes that DOD addressed this requirement because it sent questionnaires to DOD hiring officials and human resource professionals to collect information on flexible employment authorities and conducted interviews with these and human resource professionals at the same 17 organizations used for the cost comparison. Based on an analysis of the information collected, DOD's report included several conclusions regarding flexible hiring authorities and made one recommendation. GAO is not making any recommendations; however, DOD non-concurred with GAO's assessment that DOD partially addressed the element to account for the full cost of personnel.

DHS's acquisition activities are on GAO's High Risk List, in part, because of management and funding issues. The Explanatory Statement accompanying the DHS Appropriations Act, 2015 included a provision for GAO to review DHS's major acquisitions. This report, GAO's fourth annual review, assesses the extent to which: (1) DHS's major acquisition programs are on track to meet their schedule and cost goals, and (2) DHS has taken actions to enhance its policies and processes to better reflect key practices for effectively managing a portfolio of investments. GAO reviewed 28 acquisition programs, including DHS's largest programs that were in the process of obtaining new capabilities as of April 2017, and programs GAO or DHS identified as at risk of poor outcomes. GAO assessed cost and schedule progress against baselines, assessed DHS's policies and processes against GAO's key portfolio management practices, and met with relevant DHS officials. During 2017, 10 of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) programs GAO assessed that had approved schedule and cost goals were on track to meet those goals. GAO reviewed 28 programs in total, 4 of which were new programs that GAO did not assess because they did not establish cost and schedule goals before the end of calendar year 2017 as planned. The table shows the status of the 24 programs GAO assessed. Reasons for schedule delays or cost increases included technical challenges, changes in requirements, and external factors. Recent enhancements to DHS's acquisition management, resource allocation, and requirements policies largely reflect key portfolio management practices (see table). However, DHS is in the early stages of implementing these policies. GAO identified two areas where DHS could strengthen its portfolio management policies and implementation efforts: DHS's policies do not reflect the key practice to reassess a program that breaches—or exceeds—its cost, schedule, or performance goals in the context of the portfolio to ensure it is still relevant or affordable. Acquisition management officials said that, in practice, they do so based on a certification of funds memorandum—a tool GAO has found to be effective for DHS leadership to assess program affordability—submitted by the component when one of its programs re-baselines in response to a breach. Documenting this practice in policy would help ensure DHS makes strategic investment decisions within its limited budget. DHS is not leveraging information gathered from reviews once programs complete implementation to manage its portfolio of active acquisition programs. DHS's acquisition policy requires programs to conduct post-implementation reviews after initial capabilities are deployed, which is in line with GAO's key practices. Acquisition management officials said they do not consider the results of these reviews in managing DHS's portfolio because the reviews are typically conducted after oversight for a program shifts to the components. Leveraging these results across DHS could enable DHS to address potential issues that may contribute to poor outcomes, such as schedule slips and cost growth, for other programs in its acquisition portfolio. GAO recommends DHS update its acquisition policy to require certification of fund memorandums when programs re-baseline as a result of a breach and assess programs' post-implementation reviews to improve performance across the acquisition portfolio.

Following four significant maritime incidents in 2017 that resulted in 17 sailor deaths and ship damage, the Navy initiated internal reviews and implemented 78 of 111 recommendations to improve fleet readiness. While progress has been made in training certifications and manning, persistent maintenance and operational challenges remain. The Navy has struggled to complete ship and submarine maintenance on time, leading to costly delays and reduced operational availability. Shipyard conditions, workforce shortages, and supply chain inefficiencies contribute to these delays. The Navy's efforts to expand its fleet by 25% will likely exacerbate these issues, requiring significant investment and management attention. Additionally, the Marine Corps faces challenges in amphibious operations training due to a decline in amphibious ships and limited range access. Aircraft readiness is also compromised by aging fleets, delayed maintenance, and supply chain issues, particularly with the F-35 program, which faces reliability and sustainment challenges. The report emphasizes the need for sustained efforts to address these issues, including improved maintenance planning, workforce development, and better coordination across DOD components. The Navy and Marine Corps have made progress in some areas, but fully addressing readiness challenges will require continued focus and resources over the coming years.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report.

The Navy and Marine Corps are working to rebuild the readiness of their forces while growing and modernizing their aging fleet of ships and aircraft. However, achieving readiness recovery goals will take years as both services continue to be challenged to rebuild readiness amid continued operational demands. This statement provides information on current and future readiness challenges facing (1) the Navy ship and submarine fleet and (2) Navy and Marine Corps aviation. GAO also discusses prior recommendations on Navy and Marine Corps readiness and progress to address them. This statement is based on previously published work since 2015 related to Navy and Marine Corps readiness challenges, including shipyard workforce and capital investment, ship crewing, weapon system sustainment, the fighter pilot workforce, and modernizing force structure. GAO conducted site visits to the Pacific fleet in November 2018 and analyzed updated data, as appropriate. The Navy has taken steps to address training shortfalls in the surface fleet, but faces persistent maintenance and personnel challenges as it seeks to rebuild ship and submarine readiness. While the Navy has corrective actions underway, they will take years to implement. Following ship collisions in 2017, the Navy has taken steps to ensure its crews are trained to standards prior to deployment and made significant progress in those efforts. However, the Navy has struggled to complete ship maintenance—with only 30 percent of maintenance completed on time since fiscal year 2012—leading to thousands of days that ships were unavailable for training and operations (see figure). Additionally, manning shortfalls and experience gaps continue to contribute to high sailor workload and are likely to continue through at least fiscal year 2021. The Navy has developed a plan to improve shipyards and is re-examining its ship manning, among other actions; however, these positive steps have not yet fully addressed GAO's recommendations. Looking to the future, the Navy has indicated that it wants to grow its fleet to meet demands. However, the costs of such growth are not yet known and would likely require resourcing well above currently planned levels. Navy and Marine Corps aircraft availability has been limited due to numerous challenges (see figure). Specifically, the seven aircraft GAO reviewed have generally experienced decreasing availability since fiscal year 2011 and did not meet availability goals in fiscal years 2017 and 2018. The F-35—the future of naval aviation—also has not met availability goals due to part shortages and poor sustainment planning. In September 2018, the Department of Defense established aggressive targets for aircraft availability. While the Navy and Marine Corps are taking actions to improve aircraft availability, including addressing GAO's recommendations, aviation readiness will take many years to recover. GAO has made a total of 45 recommendations in the prior work described in this statement.

{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins)\nThe Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is a government agency under the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) that insures private mortgage lenders against borrower defaults. FHA insurance ensures that lenders are repaid if a borrower defaults, but does not protect the borrower from foreclosure. FHA is one of three federal agencies providing mortgage insurance, alongside the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Unlike VA and USDA programs, FHA is more broadly targeted and does not restrict eligibility based on veteran status, income, or property location. FHA-insured mortgages are available to a wide range of borrowers, including first-time homebuyers, low- and moderate-income households, and minorities, due to lower down payment requirements and more lenient credit standards. FHA plays a countercyclical role in the mortgage market, increasing insurance during economic downturns and reducing it during periods of economic stability. FHA-insured loans typically require a minimum down payment of 3.5% for borrowers with credit scores of 580 or higher, and 10% for those with scores below 580. The maximum mortgage amount varies by area and property type, based on median home prices. FHA charges both up-front and annual mortgage insurance premiums, which have been adjusted over time to ensure the financial stability of the FHA insurance fund. The Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund) is funded through insurance premiums and proceeds from foreclosed homes, and is required to maintain a capital ratio of at least 2% to ensure it can cover potential losses. FHA's market share in the mortgage market has fluctuated over time, peaking during the 2007-2009 housing crisis and decreasing in recent years due to factors such as higher insurance premiums and increased availability of non-FHA mortgages. FHA's role in promoting homeownership and stabilizing the mortgage market remains significant, particularly for borrowers who might otherwise face barriers to obtaining a mortgage.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of the given report about the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).

FHA insures private lenders against the possibility of borrowers defaulting on mortgages that meet certain criteria, thereby expanding the availability of mortgage credit beyond what may be available otherwise. If the borrower defaults on the mortgage, FHA is to repay the lender the remaining amount owed. A household that obtains an FHA-insured mortgage must meet FHA's eligibility and underwriting standards, including showing that it has sufficient income to repay a mortgage. FHA requires a minimum down payment of 3.5% from most borrowers, which is lower than the down payment required for many other types of mortgages. FHA-insured mortgages cannot exceed a statutory maximum mortgage amount, which varies by area and is based on area median house prices but cannot exceed a specified ceiling in high-cost areas. (The ceiling is set at $726,525 in high-cost areas in calendar year 2019.) Borrowers are charged fees, called mortgage insurance premiums, in exchange for the insurance. In FY2018, FHA insured over 1 million new mortgages (including both home purchase and refinance mortgages) with a combined principal balance of $209 billion. FHA's share of the mortgage market tends to vary with economic conditions and other factors. In the aftermath of the housing market turmoil that began around 2007 and a related contraction of mortgage lending, FHA insured a larger share of mortgages than it had in the preceding years. Its overall share of the mortgage market increased from about 3% in calendar year 2005 to a peak of 21% in 2009. Since that time, FHA's share of the mortgage market has decreased somewhat, though it remains higher than it was in the early 2000s. In calendar year 2017, FHA's overall share of the mortgage market was about 17%. FHA-insured mortgages, like all mortgages, experienced increased default rates during the housing downturn that began around 2007, leading to concerns about the stability of the FHA insurance fund for single-family mortgages, the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund). In response to these concerns, FHA adopted a number of policy changes in an attempt to limit risk to the MMI Fund.

The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget estimates the ship's procurement cost at $13,084.0 million (i.e., about $13.1 billion) in then-year dollars. The ship received advance procurement (AP) funding in FY2001-FY2007 and was fully funded in FY2008-FY2011 using congressionally authorized four-year incremental funding. To help cover cost growth on the ship, the ship received an additional $1,394.9 million in FY2014-FY2016 and FY2018 cost-to-complete procurement funding. The ship was delivered to the Navy on May 31, 2017, and was commissioned into service on July 22, 2017. The Navy is currently working to complete construction, testing, and certification of the ship's 11 weapons elevators. CVN-79 (John F. Kennedy) was procured in FY2013. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget estimates the ship's procurement cost at $11,327.4 million (i.e., about $11.3 billion) in then-year dollars. The ship received AP funding in FY2007-FY2012, and was fully funded in FY2013-FY2018 using congressionally authorized six-year incremental funding. The ship is scheduled for delivery to the Navy in September 2024. CVN-80 (Enterprise) and CVN-81 (not yet named) are being procured under a two-ship block buy contract that was authorized by Section 121(a)(2) of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (H.R. 5515/P.L. 115-232 of August 13, 2018). The provision permitted the Navy to add CVN-81 to the existing contract for building CVN-80 after the Department of Defense (DOD) made certain certifications to Congress. DOD made the certifications on December 31, 2018, and the Navy announced the award of the contract on January 31, 2019. Compared to the estimated procurement costs for CVN-80 and CVN-81 in the Navy's FY2019 budget submission, the Navy estimates under its FY2020 budget submission that the two-ship block buy contract will reduce the cost of CVN-80 by $246.6 million and the cost of CVN-81 by $2,637.3 million, for a combined reduction of $2,883.9 million (i.e., about $2.9 billion). Using higher estimated baseline costs for CVN-80 and CVN-81 taken from a December 2017 Navy business case analysis, the Navy estimates under its FY2020 budget submission that the two-ship contract will reduce the cost of CVN-80 by $770.9 million and the cost of CVN-81 by $3,086.3 million, for a combined reduction of $3,857.2 million (i.e., about $3.9 billion). CVN-80 was procured in FY2018. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget estimates the ship's procurement cost at $12,335.1 million (i.e., about $12.3 billion) in then-year dollars.

The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests $1,062.0 million in procurement funding for the ship. The ship is scheduled for delivery to the Navy in March 2028. Prior to the awarding of the two-ship block buy contract, CVN-81 was scheduled to be procured in FY2023. Following the awarding of the two-ship block buy contract, the Navy has chosen to show CVN-81 in its FY2020 budget submission as a ship to be procured in FY2020 (as opposed to a ship that was procured in FY2019). The Navy's FY2020 budget submission estimates the ship's procurement cost at $12,450.7 million (i.e., about $12.5 billion) in then-year dollars. The Navy plans to fully fund the ship beginning in FY2019 and extending beyond FY2026 using incremental funding authorized by Section 121(c) of P.L. 115-232. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests $1,285.0 million in procurement funding for the ship. The ship is scheduled for delivery to the Navy in February 2032. The Navy's FY2020 budget submission proposed to not fund the mid-life nuclear refueling overhaul (called a Refueling Complex Overhaul, or RCOH) for the aircraft carrier CVN-75 (Harry S.

On April 30, 2019, however, the Administration announced that it was effectively withdrawing this proposal from the Navy's FY2020 budget submission. The Administration now supports funding the CVN-75 RCOH and keeping CVN-75 (and by implication its associated air wing) in service past FY2024. Oversight issues for Congress for the CVN-78 program include the following: DOD's decision to show CVN-81 in its FY2020 budget submission as a ship to be procured in FY2020, instead of a ship that was procured in FY2019; the Navy's decision, as part of its FY2020 budget submission, to not accelerate the scheduled procurement of CVN-82 from FY2028 to an earlier fiscal year; whether to approve, reject, or modify the Navy's FY2020 procurement funding request for the CVN-78 program; the date for achieving the Navy's 12-ship force-level goal for aircraft carriers; cost growth in the CVN-78 program, Navy efforts to stem that growth, and Navy efforts to manage costs so as to stay within the program's cost caps; Navy efforts to complete the construction, testing, and certification of the weapons elevators on CVN-78; additional CVN-78 program issues that were raised in a December 2018 report from the Department of Defense's (DOD's) Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E); additional CVN-78 program issues that were raised in a May 2019 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on DOD weapon systems; whether the Navy should shift at some point from procuring large-deck, nuclear-powered carriers like the CVN-78 class to procuring smaller aircraft carriers."], "all_classes": null, "length": 32726}
{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report to understand the main points. The report is about the Interagency Security Committee (ISC) and how federal agencies are managing security risks in their facilities. The ISC was established after the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 to set security standards for federal buildings. The report looks at four agencies: CBP, FAA, ARS, and the Forest Service. \n\nThe key issue is that these agencies aren't fully aligning their risk assessment methodologies with the ISC Standard. The ISC requires agencies to assess all 33 undesirable events, evaluate threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences, and document any deviations from standard countermeasures. However, the agencies are using their own methods that don't cover all events or properly assess all three risk factors. For example, CBP's methodology didn't consider all events and didn't assess threats and consequences, even though they updated some parts. FAA had a similar issue but was working on improving their process. ARS and the Forest Service followed USDA's methodology, which also didn't fully align with the ISC Standard.\n\nThe report also mentions challenges in conducting assessments, like backlogs due to insufficient staff and competing priorities. Agencies aren't monitoring their security programs effectively, leading to gaps in data collection and analysis. This makes it hard to allocate resources properly and implement necessary countermeasures. Some facilities had unimplemented recommendations, and there were issues with documentation and justifying deviations from standards.\n\nThe recommendations include updating policies, balancing priorities, and improving data collection. The agencies responded positively, but the report highlights ongoing issues. The summary needs to capture these points concisely, highlighting the problem, the agencies involved, the shortcomings in their methods, the challenges faced, and the recommendations. I should make sure to mention the ISC's role, the four agencies, the alignment issues, the specific problems each agency had, the management challenges, and the recommendations. Also, note that the agencies have started to improve but haven't fully resolved the issues yet. Keep it to one page, double-spaced, with clear sections. Avoid jargon, keep it straightforward. Let me structure this into a coherent summary now.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of the report. Let me start by identifying the main points. The report discusses the Interagency Security Committee (ISC) and its risk management standards for federal facilities", "answers": ["Protecting federal employees and facilities from security threats is of critical importance. Most federal agencies are generally responsible for their facilities and have physical security programs to do so. GAO was asked to examine how federal agencies assess facilities' security risks. This report examines: (1) how selected agencies' assessment methodologies align with the ISC's risk management standard for identifying necessary countermeasures and (2) what management challenges, if any, selected agencies reported facing in conducting physical security assessments and monitoring the results. GAO selected four agencies—CBP, FAA, ARS, and the Forest Service—based on their large number of facilities and compared each agency's assessment methodology to the ISC Standard; analyzed facility assessment schedules and results from 2010 through 2016; and interviewed security officials. GAO also visited 13 facilities from these four agencies, selected based on geographical dispersion and their high risk level. None of the four agencies GAO reviewed—U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), and the Forest Service—used security assessment methodologies that fully aligned with the Interagency Security Committee's Risk Management Process for Federal Facilities standard (the ISC Standard). This standard requires that methodologies used to identify necessary facility countermeasures—such as fences and closed-circuit televisions—must: 1. Consider all of the undesirable events (i.e., arson and vandalism) identified by the ISC Standard as possible risks to facilities. 2. Assess three factors—threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences—for each of these events and use these three factors to measure risk. All four agencies used methodologies that included some ISC requirements when conducting assessments. CBP and FAA assessed vulnerabilities but not threats and consequences. ARS and the Forest Service assessed threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences, but did not use these factors to measure risk. In addition, the agencies considered many, but not all 33 undesirable events related to physical security as possible risks to their facilities. Agencies are taking steps to improve their methodologies. For example, ARS and the Forest Service now use a methodology that measures risk and plan to incorporate the methodology into policy. Although CBP and FAA have updated their methodologies, their policies do not require methodologies that fully align with the ISC standard. As a result, these agencies miss the opportunity for a more informed assessment of the risk to their facilities. All four agencies reported facing management challenges in conducting physical security assessments or monitoring assessment results. Specifically, CBP, ARS, and the Forest Service have not met the ISC's required time frame of every 3 years for conducting assessments. For example, security specialists have not conducted required reassessments of two ARS and one Forest Service higher-level facilities. While these three agencies have plans to address backlogs, CBP's plan does not balance conducting risk assessments with other competing security priorities, such as updating its policy manual, and ARS and the Forest Service lack a means to monitor completion of future assessments. Furthermore, CBP, ARS, and the Forest Service did not have the data or information systems to monitor assessment schedules or the status of countermeasures at facilities, and their policies did not specify such data requirements. For example, ARS and the Forest Service do not collect and analyze security-related data, such as countermeasures' implementation. FAA does not routinely monitor the performance of its physical security program. Without improved monitoring, agencies are not well equipped to prioritize their highest security needs, may leave facilities' vulnerabilities unaddressed, and may not take corrective actions to meet physical security program objectives. This is a public version of a sensitive report that GAO issued in August 2017. Information that the agencies under review deemed sensitive has been omitted. GAO recommends: (1) that CBP and FAA update policies to require the use of methodologies fully aligned with the ISC Standard; (2) that CBP revise its plan to eliminate the assessments backlog; and (3) that all four agencies improve monitoring of their physical security programs. All four agencies agreed with the respective recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6755}
{"pred": " The report discusses the Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) system used by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to estimate improper payment rates in Medicaid programs. The PERM is designed to identify and measure improper payments in both fee-for-service (FFS) and managed care components of Medicaid. The report highlights that while the PERM provides a statistically valid estimate of improper payments, it does not fully account for all program integrity risks, particularly in the managed care component. The managed care component of PERM focuses on the accuracy of capitated payments made by state Medicaid agencies to managed care organizations (MCOs), but it does not assess other risks such as overpayments to providers or unallowable MCO costs. The report notes that these unaccounted risks can lead to inflated capitation rates and increased state and federal spending. The report also discusses the findings from audits and investigations of MCOs, which identified significant overpayments and unallowable costs not captured by the PERM. These findings suggest that the current PERM methodology may underestimate the true extent of program integrity risks in Medicaid managed care. The report recommends that CMS consider revising the PERM methodology or increasing audit resources to better address these risks. The report concludes that without improved measurement of these risks, the integrity of Medicaid managed care programs may be compromised.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report. Let me start by reading through the user's query again to make sure I understand what they need. They provided a detailed report about the PERM system used by CMS to estimate Medicaid improper payments, and they want a one-page summary. \n\nFirst, I should identify the main points of the report. The report discusses the PERM, its purpose under IPIA, how it's structured for FFS and managed care, and the limitations of the managed care component. It also mentions audits and investigations that found overpayments not captured by PERM, and recommendations for CMS to improve oversight.\n\nI need to condense this into a concise summary. Let me outline the key sections:\n\n1. Introduction to PERM and its purpose under IPIA.\n2. How PERM works for FFS and managed care, noting the differences.\n3. Limitations of the managed care component, especially not accounting for overpayments and unallowable costs.\n4. Findings from audits and investigations showing significant overpayments not captured by PERM.\n5. Recommendations for CMS to revise PERM or increase audits.\n6. Conclusion about the need for better measurement of", "answers": ["The improper payment rate is a sentinel measure of program integrity risks for the Medicaid program. CMS and the states oversee Medicaid, whose size, structure, and diversity make it vulnerable to improper payments. CMS estimates the Medicaid improper payment rate annually through its PERM, which includes an estimate for Medicaid managed care, in which states contract with MCOs to provide services to Medicaid enrollees. GAO was asked to study the PERM methodology for managed care. In this report, GAO examined the extent to which the PERM accounts for program integrity risks in Medicaid managed care, including CMS's and states' oversight. GAO identified program integrity risks reported in 27 federal and state audits and investigations issued between January 2012 and September 2017; reviewed federal regulations and guidance on the PERM and CMS's Focused Program Integrity Reviews; and contacted program integrity officials in the 16 states with a majority of 2016 Medicaid spending for managed care, as well as CMS officials and program integrity experts. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) estimate of improper payments for Medicaid managed care has limitations that are not mitigated by the agency's and states' current oversight efforts. One component of the Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) measures the accuracy of capitated payments, which are periodic payments that state Medicaid agencies make to managed care organizations (MCO) to provide services to enrollees and to cover other allowable costs, such as administrative expenses. However, the managed care component of the PERM neither includes a medical review of services delivered to enrollees, nor reviews of MCO records or data. Further, GAO's review of the 27 federal and state audits and investigations identified key program risks. Ten of the 27 federal and state audits and investigations identified about $68 million in overpayments and unallowable MCO costs that were not accounted for by PERM estimates; another of these investigations resulted in a $137.5 million settlement. These audits and investigations were conducted over more than 5 years and involved a small fraction of the more than 270 MCOs operating nationwide as of September 2017. To the extent that overpayments and unallowable costs are unidentified and not removed from the cost data used to set capitation rates, they may allow inflated MCO payments and minimize the appearance of program risks in Medicaid managed care. CMS and states have taken steps to improve oversight of Medicaid managed care through updated regulations, focused reviews of states' managed care programs, and federal program integrity contractors' audits of managed care services. However, some of these efforts went into effect only recently, and others are unlikely to address the risks in managed care across all states. Furthermore, these efforts do not ensure the identification and reporting of overpayments to providers and unallowable costs by MCOs. Federal internal control standards call for agency management to identify and respond to risks. Without addressing key risks, such as the extent of overpayments and unallowable costs, CMS cannot be certain that its estimated improper payment rate for managed care (0.3 percent compared with 12.9 percent in Medicaid fee-for-service) accurately reflects program risks. The Administrator of CMS should consider and take steps to mitigate the program risks that are not measured in the PERM, such as overpayments and unallowable costs; such an effort could include actions such as revising the PERM methodology or focusing additional audit resources on managed care.

{"pred": " The Federal Reserve (Fed) is the central bank of the United States, responsible for monetary policy, emergency liquidity provision, bank supervision, and payment system services. Congress delegates monetary policy to the Fed, which aims to achieve maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The Fed defines stable prices as a 2% inflation target, measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index. While employment is not a fixed target, the Fed must consider its maximum level. Monetary policy primarily affects inflation in the long run and stabilizes the business cycle in the short run. The Fed's main tool is the federal funds rate, which influences other interest rates. During the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed lowered the federal funds rate to 0%–0.25%, the zero lower bound, and later implemented quantitative easing (QE) to stimulate the economy. The Fed has since raised rates gradually, with the last increase in 2015. The Fed's policy is data-dependent, adjusting based on economic conditions. The current federal funds rate is near the neutral rate, balancing economic growth and inflation. The Fed faces challenges in maintaining this balance, as overly stimulative policy could lead to inflation or overheating, while tightening too quickly might harm the economy. The Fed's balance sheet has expanded significantly due to QE, and it is now reducing it through asset sales. The Fed also uses tools like interest on reserves and reverse repos to manage liquidity. The Fed's regulatory role includes supervising banks, nonbank systemically important financial institutions, and the payment system to ensure safety and soundness. The Fed's actions aim to mitigate systemic risk and maintain financial stability, especially in light of the lessons learned from the financial crisis.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this detailed report about the Federal Reserve. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report explains the Fed's four main responsibilities: monetary policy, emergency liquidity as a lender of last resort, bank supervision, and payment system services. Congress delegates monetary policy to the Fed but retains oversight. The Fed's mandate is maximum employment, stable prices (2% inflation target), and moderate interest rates. They mention that employment isn't a fixed target but must consider maximum levels. Monetary policy affects inflation long-term and stabilizes the business cycle short-term. The main tool is the federal funds rate, which influences other rates. \n\nDuring the 2008 crisis, the Fed cut", "answers": ["Congress has delegated responsibility for monetary policy to the Federal Reserve (the Fed), the nation's central bank, but retains oversight responsibilities for ensuring that the Fed is adhering to its statutory mandate of \"maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.\" To meet its price stability mandate, the Fed has set a longer-run goal of 2% inflation. The Fed's control over monetary policy stems from its exclusive ability to alter the money supply and credit conditions more broadly. Normally, the Fed conducts monetary policy by setting a target for the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks borrow and lend reserves on an overnight basis. It meets its target through open market operations, financial transactions traditionally involving U.S. Treasury securities. Beginning in 2007, the federal funds target was reduced from 5.25% to a range of 0% to 0.25% in December 2008, which economists call the zero lower bound. By historical standards, rates were kept unusually low for an unusually long time to mitigate the effects of the financial crisis and its aftermath. Starting in December 2015, the Fed has been raising interest rates and expects to gradually raise rates further. The Fed raised rates once in 2016, three times in 2017, and four times in 2018, by 0.25 percentage points each time. In light of increased economic uncertainty and financial volatility, the Fed announced in January 2019 that it would be \"patient\" before raising rates again. The Fed influences interest rates to affect interest-sensitive spending, such as business capital spending on plant and equipment, household spending on consumer durables, and residential investment. In addition, when interest rates diverge between countries, it causes capital flows that affect the exchange rate between foreign currencies and the dollar, which in turn affects spending on exports and imports. Through these channels, monetary policy can be used to stimulate or slow aggregate spending in the short run. In the long run, monetary policy mainly affects inflation. A low and stable rate of inflation promotes price transparency and, thereby, sounder economic decisions. The Fed's relative independence from Congress and the Administration has been justified by many economists on the grounds that it reduces political pressure to make monetary policy decisions that are inconsistent with a long-term focus on stable inflation. But independence reduces accountability to Congress and the Administration, and recent legislation and criticism of the Fed by the President has raised the question about the proper balance between the two. While the federal funds target was at the zero lower bound, the Fed attempted to provide additional stimulus through unsterilized purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities (MBS), a practice popularly referred to as quantitative easing (QE). Between 2009 and 2014, the Fed undertook three rounds of QE. The third round was completed in October 2014, at which point the Fed's balance sheet was $4.5 trillion—five times its precrisis size. After QE ended, the Fed maintained the balance sheet at the same level until September 2017, when it began to very gradually reduce it to a more normal size. The Fed has raised interest rates in the presence of a large balance sheet through the use of two new tools—by paying banks interest on reserves held at the Fed and by engaging in reverse repurchase agreements (reverse repos) through a new overnight facility. In January 2019, the Fed announced that it would continue using these tools to set interest rates permanently, in which case the balance sheet may not get much smaller than its current size of $4 trillion. With regard to its mandate, the Fed believes that unemployment is currently lower than the rate that it considers consistent with maximum employment, and inflation is close to the Fed's 2% goal by the Fed's preferred measure. Even after recent rate increases, monetary policy is still considered expansionary. This monetary policy stance is unusually stimulative compared with policy in this stage of previous expansions, and is being coupled with a stimulative fiscal policy (larger structural budget deficit). Debate is currently focused on how quickly the Fed should raise rates. Some contend the greater risk is that raising rates too slowly at full employment will cause inflation to become too high or cause financial instability, whereas others contend that raising rates too quickly will cause inflation to remain too low and choke off the expansion."], "all_classes": null, "length": 7241}
{"pred": " The report examines the federal government's procurement of foreign end products under the Buy American Act (BAA) and the associated exceptions and waivers. The BAA, enacted in 1933, prioritizes domestic products but allows exceptions for cases like domestic non-availability, unreasonable cost, or trade agreements. The report highlights that in fiscal year 2017, the federal government obligated about $7.8 billion for foreign end products, representing less than 5% of total federal contract obligations. The majority of these purchases were for products from South Korea, the UK, Canada, and others, with DOD accounting for over 80% of these obligations, primarily due to purchases for use outside the U.S. or under reciprocal agreements with 27 countries. The report also identifies challenges in data reporting, noting inaccuracies in the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG), including misreporting of exceptions and product origins. Agencies like DOD, HHS, DHS, and VA face difficulties in applying the BAA requirements, with varying levels of training and guidance. The report recommends improvements in training, data accuracy, and guidance to ensure compliance with the BAA and its exceptions. The findings underscore the need for better internal controls and communication to enhance transparency and adherence to the BAA's domestic preference policies.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report. Let me start by understanding the main points. The report is about the Buy American Act (BAA) and how the federal government procures foreign products under it. The BAA was created during the Great Depression to support domestic jobs, but there are exceptions and waivers. The report mentions that in 2017, the government spent about $7.8 billion on foreign products, which is less than 5% of total contracts. DOD is a big part of this, mostly because they buy things for use outside the US or have reciprocal agreements with 27 countries. \n\nThere are challenges with data reporting, like FPDS-NG having errors. The report also talks about how different agencies handle the BAA, with some having better training and guidance than others. The recommendations include improving training, data accuracy, and guidance.

I need to make sure it's all", "answers": ["The Buy American Act of 1933, as amended, is the main U.S. law promoting domestic purchasing. The Act permits agencies to buy foreign end products only under certain exceptions, such as when domestic items are not available at a reasonable cost. Further, U.S. trade agreements waive the Buy American restrictions for certain products. GAO was asked to review implementation of the Buy American Act. This report assesses the extent to which (1) the federal government procures foreign products through Buy American Act exceptions and waivers; and (2) selected agencies provide training and guidance to implement the Act. GAO reviewed laws, regulations, and policies related to the Buy American Act and analyzed data for fiscal year 2017 from FPDS-NG. GAO also analyzed a non-generalizable sample of 38 contracts from DOD, HHS, DHS, and VA—the agencies with the most obligations for products in fiscal year 2017. The 38 awards selected include a mix of foreign and domestic products, as well as dollars obligated. Finally, GAO interviewed cognizant contracting and policy officials from the selected agencies. According to data reported in the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) in fiscal year 2017, foreign end products accounted for less than 5 percent—about $7.8 billion—of federal obligations for products potentially subject to the Buy American Act. Federal agencies procured foreign products using exceptions to Buy American Act requirements, as well as through waivers or when the Buy American Act did not apply, as shown in the figure. The amount of foreign end products purchased could be greater than reported in FPDS-NG, however, due to reporting errors and system limitations. GAO found that 6 of the 38 contracts reviewed from the Departments of Defense (DOD), Health and Human Services (HHS), Homeland Security (DHS), and Veterans Affairs (VA) inaccurately recorded waiver or exception information. FPDS-NG system limitations compound these errors because it does not fully capture Buy American Act data. Among other things, the database does not always enable agencies to report the use of exceptions or waivers on contracts for both foreign and domestic products, reducing data accuracy. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is considering strategies to improve Buy American Act data. The four agencies GAO reviewed varied in their approaches to Buy American Act training and guidance. DOD reports that it will have trained more than 18,000 personnel by the end of 2018. DHS reports training almost 1,400 people—approximately 94 percent of its contracting staff—as of April 2018. Some VA courses mention the Act, but none is focused specifically on implementing its requirements. HHS does not have agency-level training or guidance on the Act. GAO found that contracting officers for the contracts it reviewed face challenges implementing Buy American Act requirements. Having specific and targeted Buy American Act guidance and training can better ensure that agencies meet the Act's requirements.

However, the transition involves significant technical, operational, and governance challenges. States and localities face issues such as insufficient funding, evolving technology, interoperability concerns, cybersecurity risks, and varying governance structures. Federal agencies, including NHTSA, NTIA, FCC, and DHS, are supporting the transition through grants, cost studies, technology standards, and cybersecurity guidance. Despite these efforts, the National 911 Program lacks specific goals and performance measures to assess its effectiveness.

It also talks about federal and state efforts to support this transition, the issues faced by states and localities, and the recommendations made.\n\nFirst, I should outline the key sections. The report starts by explaining the evolution of 911 services from basic to Enhanced 911 and then to NG911. NG911 uses IP technology, allowing for multimedia and better data handling. Then it discusses the implementation process, the challenges like funding, technology, governance, and cybersecurity.

I should mention the transition to NG911, its benefits, the challenges faced by states and localities, the federal support measures, and the recommendations. I need to avoid too much technical jargon but still be accurate. Also, the summary should highlight the main findings and the key recommendations.\n\nLet me check if I missed any important points. The report mentions that states have varying governance structures", "answers": ["Each year, millions of Americans call 911 for help during emergencies. However, the nation's legacy 911 system relies on aging infrastructure that is not designed to accommodate modern communications technologies. As a result, states and localities are upgrading to NG911, which offers improved capabilities, such as the ability to process images, audio files, and video. While deploying NG911 is the responsibility of state and local entities, federal agencies also support implementation, led by NHTSA's National 911 Program, which facilitates collaboration among federal, state, and local 911 stakeholders. GAO was asked to review NG911 implementation nationwide. This report examines: (1) state and local progress and challenges in implementing NG911 and (2) federal actions to address challenges and planned next steps. GAO reviewed relevant statutes, regulations, and federal agency reports and plans. GAO also analyzed NHTSA's survey data on state 911 implementation for calendar year 2015, the most recent year for which data were available, and interviewed federal officials, state and local officials from nine states (selected to represent different regions and various phases of NG911 implementation), and officials from industry and advocacy groups. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) National 911 Program's most recent national survey on Next Generation 911 (NG911) implementation indicated that about half of states were in some phase of transition to NG911 in 2015, but that state and local progress varied. Specifically, 10 states reported that all 911 authorities in their state processed calls using NG911 systems; however, 18 states reported having no state or local NG911 transition plans in place—which may indicate these states were in the early phases of planning for the transition to NG911 or had not yet begun. GAO spoke with state and local 911 officials in 9 states, which were in various phases of implementing NG911, and found that none of the 9 selected states were accepting images, audio files, or video. State and local 911 officials identified a number of challenges to implementing NG911. Such challenges are related to funding, evolving technology and operations, and governance. For example, officials in 3 states said that the current funding they collect from telephone service subscribers may not be sufficient to support NG911's transition costs while simultaneously funding the operation of existing 911 systems. Federal agencies—including NHTSA, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the Federal Communications Commission, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security—have responsibilities to support NG911 implementation, such as through coordinating activities and administering grants, and are taking actions to assist state and local entities in addressing challenges to NG911's implementation. Such actions include developing resources, offering technical assistance, and convening stakeholders to explore emerging NG911 issues. For example, as the lead entity for coordinating federal NG911 efforts, NHTSA's National 911 Program is developing resources on NG911 topics, such as federal funding and governance structures. While the National 911 Program is taking steps to facilitate the state and local transition to NG911, the program lacks specific performance goals and measures to assess its progress. Without such goals and measures, it is not clear to what extent the program is effectively achieving its mission. In 2018, the National 911 Program plans to establish an interagency initiative tasked with creating a National NG911 Roadmap. This roadmap is intended to identify next steps for the federal government in supporting the creation of a national, interconnected NG911 system. While the National 911 Program is taking steps to develop a list of national-level tasks as part of its roadmap initiative, the program does not have a plan to identify: (1) roles or responsibilities for federal entities to carry out these tasks or (2) how the program plans to achieve the roadmap's objectives. Collaborating with the appropriate federal agencies to determine federal roles and responsibilities to carry out the roadmap's national-level tasks could reduce barriers to agencies effectively working together to achieve those tasks. Furthermore, developing an implementation plan that details how the roadmap's tasks will be achieved would place the National 911 Program in a better position to effectively lead interagency efforts to implement NG911 nationwide.

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report explains that the RRB administers retirement, survivor, disability, unemployment, and sickness benefits for railroad workers and their families under the RRA and RUIA. It mentions that railroad workers have been declining since the 1950s, with some fluctuations, and that the number of beneficiaries has decreased from 623,000 in FY2008 to 574,000 in FY2017. Benefit payments increased from $10.1 billion to $12.6 billion during the same period. In FY2017, the RRB paid $12.5 billion in benefits to about 548,000 beneficiaries, including $105.4 million in unemployment and sickness benefits.\n\nThe RRA and RUIA programs are financed through payroll taxes, financial interchanges with Social Security, and the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT). The report details the two tiers of payroll taxes: Tier I and Tier II. Tier I is similar to Social Security taxes, while Tier II is based on the railroad system's needs. The financial interchange ensures that Social Security trust funds are in the same position as if railroads were under Social Security from the start. The NRRIT invests in government and private securities, providing a significant portion of funding.\n\nEligibility for benefits requires a certain number of years of railroad service and meeting Social Security rules. Benefits are structured with Tier I and Tier II annuities, with Tier I being more generous in some cases. Disability and survivor benefits are also covered, with specific rules for eligibility and reductions. The RUIA provides unemployment and sickness benefits, funded by employer taxes, with surcharges if the fund is under threat.\n\nI need to condense all this into a one-page summary.

During FY2017, the RRB paid nearly $12.5 billion in retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to approximately 548,000 beneficiaries and paid $105.4 million in unemployment and sickness benefits to approximately 28,000 claimants. Of the total $12.5 billion benefit payments in the same fiscal year, 60.0% was paid to retired workers, 8.0% to disabled workers, 14.4% to spouses, and 16.8% to survivors. The Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) authorizes retirement, disability, and survivor benefits for railroad workers and their families. RRA is financed primarily by payroll taxes, financial interchanges from Social Security, and transfers from the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT). Railroad retirement payroll taxes have two tiers: the Tier I tax is essentially the same as the Social Security payroll tax and the Tier II tax is set each year based on the railroad retirement system's asset balances, benefit payments, and administrative costs. In FY2017, the gross RRA funding was about $12.7 billion. Railroad retirement annuities are also divided into two tiers. Tier I annuities are designed to be nearly equivalent to Social Security benefits and are based on both railroad retirement and Social Security-covered employment. However, Tier I annuities are more generous than Social Security benefits in certain situations. For example, at the age of 60, railroad workers with at least 30 years of covered railroad work may receive unreduced retirement annuities. Tier II annuities are similar to private pensions and based solely on covered railroad service. Tier II annuities are paid in addition to Tier I annuities. Railroad disability annuities may be payable to totally disabled railroad workers who are permanently disabled from all work and occupational disabled workers who are found to be permanently disabled from their regular railroad occupations. Eligible spouses and survivors of railroad workers may receive a certain portion of Tier I and Tier II benefits, but divorced spouses and surviving divorced spouses are eligible for only a certain portion of Tier I benefits. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA) authorizes unemployment and sickness benefits for railroad workers. RUIA is financed solely by railroad employers, whose contributions are based on the taxable earnings of their employees. Eligibility for railroad unemployment and sickness benefits is based on recent railroad service and earnings. The maximum daily unemployment and sickness benefit payable in the benefit year that began July 1, 2018, is $77, and the maximum benefit for a biweekly claim is $770. Normal benefits are paid for up to 26 weeks in a benefit year.

{"pred": " The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is responsible for providing healthcare, benefits, and memorial services to veterans, operating one of the largest healthcare systems in the U.S. with over 1,500 facilities and 340,000 employees. The VA's mission is supported by three main components: the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), and National Cemetery Administration (NCA). VHA manages healthcare services, including electronic health records (EHRs) through the VistA system, which has been in use since the 1980s. VBA provides benefits like disability compensation and education, while NCA handles burial and memorial services. The VA relies heavily on IT infrastructure to support its operations, with over 576 active or developing systems as of 2016. VistA, a critical system for healthcare delivery, faces challenges due to its age and maintenance costs, prompting efforts to modernize it. The VA has pursued multiple modernization initiatives, including HealtheVet, iEHR, VistA Evolution, and a new program to adopt the same EHR system used by the Department of Defense (DOD). Despite these efforts, the VA has faced issues with project management, cost overruns, and delays, leading to ongoing concerns about the efficiency and effectiveness of its IT systems. The VA has also been working to comply with the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA), which aims to improve IT acquisition and management. While progress has been made in areas like software licensing and data center optimization, challenges remain, particularly in consolidating data centers and ensuring incremental development of IT projects. The VA's recent decision to adopt the DOD's EHR system is seen as a significant step toward improving interoperability and reducing system differences. However, the success of this initiative depends on effective planning and execution, which are still in early stages. Overall, the VA continues to face significant challenges in modernizing its IT systems and ensuring efficient service delivery to veterans, requiring ongoing oversight and management to achieve its mission goals.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report about the VA's IT systems and modernization efforts.

However, VA has faced challenges spanning a number of critical initiatives related to modernizing its major systems. To improve all major federal agencies' acquisitions and hold them accountable for reducing duplication and achieving cost savings, in December 2014 Congress enacted federal IT acquisition reform legislation (commonly referred to as the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act , or FITARA). GAO was asked to summarize its previous and ongoing work regarding VA's history of efforts to modernize VistA, including past use of contractors, and the department's recent effort to acquire a commercial electronic health record system to replace VistA. GAO was also asked to provide an update on VA's progress in key FITARA-related areas, including (1) data center consolidation and optimization, (2) incremental system development practices, and (3) software license management. VA generally agreed with the information upon which this statement is based. For nearly two decades, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has undertaken multiple efforts to modernize its health information system—the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (known as VistA). Two of VA's most recent efforts included the Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) program, a joint program with the Department of Defense (DOD) intended to replace separate systems used by VA and DOD with a single system; and the VistA Evolution program, which was to modernize VistA with additional capabilities and a better interface for all users. VA has relied extensively on assistance from contractors for these efforts. VA obligated over $1.1 billion for contracts with 138 contractors during fiscal years 2011 through 2016 for iEHR and VistA Evolution. Contract data showed that the 15 key contractors that worked on both programs accounted for $741 million of the funding obligated for system development, project management, and operations and maintenance to support the two programs (see figure). VA recently announced that it intends to change its VistA modernization approach and acquire the same electronic health record system that DOD is implementing. With respect to key FITARA-related areas, the department has reported progress on consolidating and optimizing its data centers, although this progress has fallen short of targets set by the Office of Management and Budget. VA has also reported $23.61 million in data center-related cost savings, yet does not expect to realize further savings from additional closures. In addition, VA's Chief Information Officer (CIO) certified the use of adequate incremental development for 10 of the department's major IT investments; however, VA has not yet updated its policy and process for CIO certification as GAO recommended. Finally, VA has issued a software licensing policy and has generated an inventory of its software licenses to inform future investment decisions. GAO has made multiple recommendations to VA aimed at improving the department's IT management.

{"pred": " The report examines the relationship between climate change and migration, highlighting the potential impacts of climate change on both slow-onset and sudden-onset disasters, which can lead to internal and international migration. It notes that while climate change is a significant factor in migration decisions, the exact extent of its influence remains uncertain. The report discusses how rising sea levels, drought, and extreme weather events can disrupt livelihoods and force people to migrate, either temporarily or permanently. It also mentions that climate change may exacerbate existing migration trends and contribute to instability and national security challenges. The U.S. government agencies, including the Department of State, USAID, and the Department of Defense, have been involved in addressing climate change and its effects on migration, but there is a lack of clear guidance and consistent prioritization of this issue. The report highlights the shift in priorities related to climate change under different administrations, with some policies being revoked or modified. It also notes that while some activities and programs have been implemented to address climate change and migration, there is a need for more focused efforts and better coordination. The report concludes with recommendations for improving the assessment and response to climate change as a driver of migration, emphasizing the importance of clear guidance and consistent policy approaches.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report. Let me start by understanding the main points. The report discusses how climate change affects migration, both internally and internationally. It mentions slow-onset disasters like drought and sea level rise, and sudden-onset events like floods and hurricanes. These events can lead to migration, either voluntary or forced. The report also talks about the U.S. government agencies—State, USAID, and DOD—addressing climate change and migration, but there's a lack of clear guidance and consistent prioritization. There's a shift in policies under different administrations, with some executive orders being revoked. The report points out that while some activities exist, they aren't focused specifically on climate-driven migration. It ends with recommendations for better assessment and policy approaches.\n\nI need to condense this into a concise summary. Start with the main topic: climate change and migration. Mention the types of disasters and their impact. Then, the role of U.S. agencies, the policy shifts, and the recommendations. Keep it to one page, so around 300-400 words. Avoid too much detail on specific examples but highlight key points like the uncertainty in climate's role, the agencies' involvement, policy changes, and the need for better guidance. Make sure", "answers": ["The effects of climate change, combined with other factors, may alter human migration trends across the globe, according to the International Organization for Migration. For example, climate change can increase the frequency and intensity of natural disasters, causing populations to move from an area. Climate change can also intensify slow-onset disasters, such as drought, crop failure, or sea level rise, potentially altering longer-term migration trends. GAO was asked to review how U.S. agencies address climate change as a potential driver of global migration. For State, USAID, and DOD, this report (1) describes executive branch actions related to climate change and migration from fiscal years 2014 through 2018; (2) examines the extent to which the agencies discussed the potential effects of climate change on migration in their plans and risk assessments; and (3) describes agency activities on the issue. GAO analyzed documents on administration priorities; reviewed agency plans, risk assessments, and documentation of agency activities; and interviewed agency officials. From fiscal years 2014 through 2018, a variety of executive branch actions related to climate change—such as executive orders and strategies—affected the Department of State (State), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Department of Defense (DOD), including their activities that could potentially address the nexus of climate change and migration. For example, a fiscal year 2016 presidential memorandum—rescinded in 2017—required agencies to develop implementation plans to identify the potential impact of climate change on human mobility, among other things. In general, however, climate change as a driver of migration was not a focus of the executive branch actions. For example, a fiscal year 2014 executive order—also rescinded in 2017—requiring agencies to prepare for the impacts of climate change did not highlight migration as a particular concern. State, USAID, and DOD have discussed the potential effects of climate change on migration in agency plans and risk assessments. For example, State and USAID required climate change risk assessments when developing country and regional strategies, and a few of the strategies reviewed by GAO identified the nexus of climate change and migration as a risk. However, State changed its approach in 2017, no longer providing missions with guidance on whether and how to include climate change risks in their integrated country strategies. In doing so, State did not include in its 2018 guidance to the missions any information on how to include climate change risks, should the missions choose to do so. Without clear guidance, State may miss opportunities to identify and address issues related to climate change as a potential driver of migration. The three agencies have been involved in climate change related activities but none were specifically focused on the nexus with global migration. For example, USAID officials said that the agency's adaptation efforts, such as its Pastoralist Areas Resilience Improvement through Market Expansion project in Ethiopia, were the most likely to include activities, such as enhancing resilience, that can indirectly address the issue of climate change as a driver of migration. GAO recommends that State provide missions with guidance that clearly documents its process for climate change risk assessments for country strategies. In commenting on a draft of this report, State indicated that it would update its integrated country strategy guidance and will specifically note that missions have the option to provide additional information on climate resilience and related topics."], "all_classes": null, "length": 14011}
{"pred": " The report examines the evolution of executive emergency powers in the United States, focusing on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and its historical context. It traces the development of these powers from the 19th century, when presidents often acted unilaterally during crises, to the 20th century, where Congress began delegating emergency authority through statutes like the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA). The report highlights how TWEA, initially used during World War I and expanded during the Great Depression and World War II, became a broad tool for economic regulation. However, concerns over unchecked executive power led to the 1976 National Emergencies Act (NEA) and the 1977 IEEPA, which aimed to limit presidential emergency powers. IEEPA, while intended to be more constrained than TWEA, has been used extensively, with presidents declaring 54 national emergencies since its enactment. The report discusses the expansion of IEEPA's scope, including the targeting of individuals and non-geographic threats, and the increasing frequency and duration of emergencies. It also addresses the legal and constitutional debates surrounding IEEPA, including its use in economic sanctions, the balance of power between Congress and the executive, and the implications for civil liberties. The report concludes that while IEEPA has been a tool for implementing congressional will, its broad application and lack of clear termination mechanisms raise ongoing concerns about executive overreach and the need for legislative oversight.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this detailed report. Let me start by understanding the main points. The report is about the evolution of executive emergency powers in the U.S., focusing on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and its history. It starts by discussing how the U.S. Constitution is silent on emergency powers, leading to ad hoc actions by presidents and Congress in the 18th and 19th centuries. Then, in the 20th century, Congress began delegating these powers through statutes like the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA), which was expanded during World War I, the Great Depression, and World War II. \n\nThe report then moves to the 1970s, where concerns about unchecked executive power led to the National Emergencies Act (NEA) in 1976 and the IEEPA in 1977. IEEPA was meant to replace TWEA but has been used extensively, with", "answers": ["The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) provides the President broad authority to regulate a variety of economic transactions following a declaration of national emergency. IEEPA, like the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA) from which it branched, sits at the center of the modern U.S. sanctions regime. Changes in the use of IEEPA powers since the act's enactment in 1977 have caused some to question whether the statute's oversight provisions are robust enough given the sweeping economic powers it confers upon the President upon declaration of a state of emergency. Over the course of the twentieth century, Congress delegated increasing amounts of emergency power to the President by statute. The Trading with the Enemy Act was one such statute. Congress passed TWEA in 1917 to regulate international transactions with enemy powers following the U.S. entry into the First World War. Congress expanded the act during the 1930s to allow the President to declare a national emergency in times of peace and assume sweeping powers over both domestic and international transactions. Between 1945 and the early 1970s, TWEA became a critically important means to impose sanctions as part of U.S. Cold War strategy. Presidents used TWEA to block international financial transactions, seize U.S.-based assets held by foreign nationals, restrict exports, modify regulations to deter the hoarding of gold, limit foreign direct investment in U.S. companies, and impose tariffs on all imports into the United States. Following committee investigations that discovered that the United States had been in a state of emergency for more than 40 years, Congress passed the National Emergencies Act (NEA) in 1976 and IEEPA in 1977. The pair of statutes placed new limits on presidential emergency powers. Both included reporting requirements to increase transparency and track costs, and the NEA required the President to annually assess and extend, if appropriate, the emergency. However, some experts argue that the renewal process has become pro forma. The NEA also afforded Congress the means to terminate a national emergency by adopting a concurrent resolution in each chamber. A decision by the Supreme Court, in a landmark immigration case, however, found the use of concurrent resolutions to terminate an executive action unconstitutional. Congress amended the statute to require a joint resolution, significantly increasing the difficulty of terminating an emergency. Like TWEA, IEEPA has become an important means to impose economic-based sanctions since its enactment; like TWEA, Presidents have frequently used IEEPA to restrict a variety of international transactions; and like TWEA, the subjects of the restrictions, the frequency of use, and the duration of emergencies have expanded over time. Initially, Presidents targeted foreign states or their governments. Over the years, however, presidential administrations have increasingly used IEEPA to target individuals, groups, and non-state actors such as terrorists and persons who engage in malicious cyber-enabled activities. As of March 1, 2019, Presidents had declared 54 national emergencies invoking IEEPA, 29 of which are still ongoing. Typically, national emergencies invoking IEEPA last nearly a decade, although some have lasted significantly longer--the first state of emergency declared under the NEA and IEEPA, which was declared in response to the taking of U.S. embassy staff as hostages by Iran in 1979, may soon enter its fifth decade. IEEPA grants sweeping powers to the President to control economic transactions. Despite these broad powers, Congress has never attempted to terminate a national emergency invoking IEEPA. Instead, Congress has directed the President on numerous occasions to use IEEPA authorities to impose sanctions. Congress may want to consider whether IEEPA appropriately balances the need for swift action in a time of crisis with Congress' duty to oversee executive action. Congress may also want to consider IEEPA's role in implementing its influence in U.S. foreign policy and national security decision-making."], "all_classes": null, "length": 14753}

The national pipeline network spans over 2.7 million miles, transporting oil, natural gas, and hazardous liquids. It is divided into three main categories: hazardous liquid, natural gas transmission and storage, and natural gas distribution. The system is managed by over 3,000 companies, with federal agencies like the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) playing key roles in security and safety oversight. The report emphasizes the importance of physical and cybersecurity measures, noting that pipelines are vulnerable to attacks, sabotage, and cyber threats. Environmental activists and nation-state actors have targeted pipelines, with recent incidents such as sabotage and cyber intrusions. The report also discusses the challenges in securing the pipeline system, including the lack of a clear process for updating security guidelines, insufficient workforce planning, and outdated risk assessment tools. TSA's Pipeline Security Guidelines, last revised in 2018, need regular updates to reflect evolving threats and incorporate best practices like the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The report highlights the need for a strategic workforce plan to address cybersecurity expertise gaps and improve the reliability of risk assessments. It recommends enhancing data collection, peer reviews, and performance metrics to ensure the pipeline security program effectively reduces risks. The findings underscore the necessity for continuous improvement in both physical and cybersecurity measures to safeguard the nation's critical infrastructure.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report.

Interstate pipelines run through remote areas and highly populated urban areas, and are vulnerable to accidents, operating errors, and malicious physical and cyber-based attack or intrusion. The energy sector accounted for 35 percent of the 796 critical infrastructure cyber incidents reported to DHS from 2013 to 2015. Several federal and private entities have roles in pipeline security. TSA is primarily responsible for the oversight of pipeline physical security and cybersecurity. GAO was asked to review TSA's efforts to assess and enhance pipeline security and cybersecurity. This report examines, among other objectives: (1) the guidance pipeline operators reported using to address security risks and the extent that TSA ensures its guidelines reflect the current threat environment; (2) the extent that TSA has assessed pipeline systems' security risks; and (3) the extent TSA has assessed its effectiveness in reducing pipeline security risks. GAO analyzed TSA documents, such as its Pipeline Security Guidelines ; evaluated TSA pipeline risk assessment efforts; and interviewed TSA officials, 10 U.S. pipeline operators—selected based on volume, geography, and material transported—and representatives from five industry associations. Pipeline operators reported using a range of guidelines and standards to address physical and cybersecurity risks, including the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) Pipeline Security Guidelines , initially issued in 2011. TSA issued revised guidelines in March 2018 to reflect changes in the threat environment and incorporate most of the principles and practices from the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity . However, TSA's revisions do not include all elements of the current framework and TSA does not have a documented process for reviewing and revising its guidelines on a regular basis. Without such a documented process, TSA cannot ensure that its guidelines reflect the latest known standards and best practices for physical security and cybersecurity, or address the dynamic security threat environment that pipelines face. Further, GAO found that the guidelines lack clear definitions to ensure that pipeline operators identify their critical facilities. GAO's analysis showed that operators of at least 34 of the nation's top 100 critical pipeline systems (determined by volume of product transported) deemed highest risk had identified no critical facilities. This may be due, in part, to the guidelines not clearly defining the criteria to determine facilities' criticality. To assess pipeline security risks, TSA conducts pipeline security reviews—Corporate Security Reviews and Critical Facility Security Reviews—to assess pipeline systems' vulnerabilities. However, GAO found that the number of TSA security reviews has varied considerably over the last several years, as shown in the table on the following page. TSA officials stated that staffing limitations have prevented TSA from conducting more reviews. Staffing levels for TSA's Pipeline Security Branch have varied significantly since fiscal year 2010 with the number of staff ranging from 14 full-time equivalents in fiscal years 2012 and 2013 to 1 in 2014. Further, TSA does not have a strategic workforce plan to help ensure it identifies the skills and competencies—such as the required level of cybersecurity expertise—necessary to carry out its pipeline security responsibilities. By establishing a strategic workforce plan, TSA can help ensure that it has identified the necessary skills, competencies, and staffing. GAO also identified factors that likely limit the usefulness of TSA's risk assessment methodology for prioritizing pipeline system reviews. Specifically, TSA has not updated its risk assessment methodology since 2014 to reflect current threats to the pipeline industry. Further, its sources of data and underlying assumptions and judgments regarding certain threat and vulnerability inputs are not fully documented. In addition, the risk assessment has not been peer reviewed since its inception in 2007. Taking steps to strengthen its risk assessment, and initiating an independent, external peer review would provide greater assurance that TSA ranks relative risk among pipeline systems using comprehensive and accurate data and methods. TSA has established performance measures to monitor pipeline security review recommendations, analyze their results, and assess effectiveness in reducing risks. However, these measures do not possess key attributes—such as clarity, and having measurable targets—that GAO has found are key to successful performance measures. By taking steps to ensure that its pipeline security program performance measures exhibit these key attributes, TSA could better assess its effectiveness at reducing pipeline systems' security risks. Pipeline Security Branch officials also reported conducting security reviews as the primary means for assessing the effectiveness of TSA's efforts to reduce pipeline security risks. However, TSA has not tracked the status of Corporate Security Review recommendations for the past 5 years. Until TSA monitors and records the status of these reviews' recommendations, it will be hindered in its efforts to determine whether its recommendations are leading to significant reduction in risk. GAO makes 10 recommendations to TSA to improve its pipeline security program management (many are listed on the next page), and DHS concurred. GAO recommends, among other things, that the TSA Administrator take the following actions: implement a documented process for reviewing, and if deemed necessary, for revising TSA's Pipeline Security Guidelines at defined intervals; clarify TSA's Pipeline Security Guidelines by defining key terms within its criteria for determining critical facilities; develop a strategic workforce plan for TSA's Security Policy and Industry Engagement‘s Surface Division; update TSA's pipeline risk assessment methodology to include current data to ensure it reflects industry conditions and threats; fully document the data sources, underlying assumptions and judgments that form the basis of TSA's pipeline risk assessment methodology; take steps to coordinate an independent, external peer review of TSA's pipeline risk assessment methodology; ensure the Security Policy and Industry Engagement‘s Surface Division has a suite of performance measures which exhibit key attributes of successful performance measures; and enter information on Corporate Security Review recommendations and monitor and record their status."], "all_classes": null, "length": 15361}

The report is about the U.S. Department of Defense's global defense posture, specifically focusing on the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) and its implications. \n\nFirst, the report explains that global defense posture is crucial for U.S. military operations and strategic communication. It's managed through DOD Instruction 3000.12, which includes three elements: forces, footprint, and agreements. EUCOM is one of the combatant commands responsible for Europe and parts of Asia, the Middle East, and the Arctic. \n\nThe report mentions that since the Cold War, the number of U.S. military sites and personnel in Europe has decreased. EUCOM has been working on ERI since 2009 to enhance posture in Europe. However, there have been issues with cost estimation and planning. DOD initially didn't have comprehensive cost data, leading to recommendations to improve cost analysis in posture planning. \n\nERI's objectives expanded in 2014 to include deterring Russian aggression. DOD has been using OCO (Overseas Contingency Operations) funding for ERI, which is typically for short-term operations. This has led to challenges in long-term planning and cost estimation. The report points out that DOD hasn't prioritized ERI initiatives against base budget projects, estimated long-term sustainment costs, or provided future cost projections to Congress. \n\nThere are also issues with infrastructure improvements and host nation agreements. DOD has established new locations and improved infrastructure, but some projects are funded outside of established processes, leading to risks. The report recommends that DOD use its established posture planning processes, develop sustainment cost estimates, and provide Congress with future cost projections. \n\nThe summary needs to be concise, covering the key points: the importance of global defense posture, ERI's role, challenges in cost estimation and planning, the use of OCO funding, and the recommendations.

This initiative has been funded using OCO appropriations, which Congress provides in addition to DOD's base budget appropriations. The Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the Continuing Appropriations and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017, included a provision for GAO to review matters related to ERI. In this report, we (1) describe changes in ERI's objectives, funding under ERI, and DOD's posture in Europe since 2014 and (2) evaluate the extent to which DOD's planning processes for posture initiatives funded under ERI prioritize those initiatives, estimate their long-term costs, and communicate their estimated costs to Congress. GAO analyzed DOD strategy documentation, budget and cost analysis guidance, budget justification materials, and cost and obligations data. GAO also interviewed knowledgeable officials within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, U.S. European Command, the military services, and the State Department. Since 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) has expanded the European Reassurance Initiative's (ERI) objectives, increased its funding, and planned enhancements to European posture. DOD expanded ERI's objectives from the short-term reassurance of allies and partners to include deterring Russian aggression in the long term and developing the capacity to field a credible combined force should deterrence fail. With respect to funding, DOD will have requested approximately $4.5 billion for ERI's posture enhancements through the end of fiscal year 2017 (about $3.2 billion for fiscal year 2017 alone), and in July 2016 EUCOM identified funding needs for future posture initiatives. The expansion of ERI's objectives has contributed to DOD's enhancing its posture in Europe. Specifically, DOD has increased the size and duration of Army combat unit deployments, planned to preposition Army equipment in Eastern Europe, added new enduring locations (e.g., locations that DOD expects to access and use to support U.S. security interests for the foreseeable future), improved infrastructure, and negotiated new agreements with European nations. As of April 2017, DOD was considering further force enhancements under ERI as part of the department's ERI budget request. DOD also was reviewing whether new enduring locations to support ERI were needed and was considering other improvements to existing infrastructure. DOD's process for planning ERI has not established priorities among posture initiatives funded under ERI relative to those in its base budget, nor estimated long-term sustainment costs for some posture initiatives funded under ERI, nor communicated future costs to Congress. ERI is being planned using a separate process from DOD's established processes and is funded from DOD's overseas contingency operations (OCO) appropriations. GAO found several weaknesses: Lack of prioritization : DOD establishes priorities among ERI posture initiatives but has not evaluated them against base budget initiatives using its posture management process. As a result, DOD lacks an understanding of the relative importance of ERI initiatives and may be investing in projects that it will not continue should OCO funding become unavailable. Lack of sustainment costs : EUCOM and the military services have not fully estimated the long-term costs to sustain equipment and construction funded under ERI. Based on DOD's approach for calculating rough order sustainment costs, GAO determined that these costs could be substantial. DOD officials said that GAO correctly applied DOD's approach for estimating sustainment costs, but noted that actual costs may be lower, because the military services may not fully fund sustainment. In the absence of comprehensive estimates, DOD has been limited in its ability to assess affordability and plan for future costs. Not communicating future costs : DOD limits Congress's visibility into the resources needed to implement ERI and achieve its objectives because it does not include future costs in its ERI budget request. This is a public version of a classified report issued in August 2017. Information on specific posture planning, guidance, and budget estimates that DOD deemed to be classified have been omitted from this report. GAO recommends that DOD prioritize ERI posture initiatives against initiatives in its base budget, develop cost estimates for sustaining initiatives, and communicate future costs to Congress.

The report is about Medicaid spending on long-term care, specifically focusing on assisted living facilities and the oversight by CMS and states. \n\nFirst, the report mentions that Medicaid spending on long-term care has increased from $146 billion in 2013 to $158 billion in 2015. It notes that spending on home and community-based services (HCBS) exceeds institutional care like nursing homes. However, Medicaid doesn't cover room and board in assisted living facilities. \n\nThe federal-state partnership involves CMS overseeing state programs, while states handle day-to-day administration. There are different HCBS programs, with waivers being the most common. CMS requires states to meet specific requirements for these waivers, like administrative authority, level of care, qualified providers, service plans, health and welfare, and financial accountability. \n\nThe report highlights that oversight of assisted living facilities varies by state, unlike nursing homes which have federal standards. States have different programs for assisted living, and there's a lack of uniformity in critical incident reporting. CMS has some requirements for critical incident systems but doesn't mandate annual reporting. \n\nThere are issues with CMS's oversight, such as unclear guidance on reporting deficiencies, lack of critical incident data, and inconsistent enforcement of annual reports. The report also mentions that states face challenges in accessing assisted living services due to facility availability, enrollment caps, and costs. Some states have policies to limit room and board charges for Medicaid beneficiaries.\n\nThe recommendations from the report include clarifying reporting requirements, standardizing critical incident reporting, and ensuring timely submission of annual reports. HHS partially agreed with these recommendations, forming a workgroup to address them.\n\nNow, I need to condense all this into a one-page summary. I should start with the key statistics, then move into the structure of Medicaid programs, the oversight issues, the challenges in assisted living, and the recommendations. I need to make sure it's concise, double-spaced, and within the margin limits. Let me check the key points again to ensure I don't miss anything important. Also, I need to mention the three recommendations and HHS's response. Alright, time to structure the summary.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of the report. Let me start by outlining the main points. The report discusses", "answers": ["The number of individuals receiving long term care services from Medicaid in community residential settings is expected to grow. These settings, which include assisted living facilities, provide a range of services that allow aged and disabled beneficiaries, who might otherwise require nursing home care, to remain in the community. State Medicaid programs and CMS, the federal agency responsible for overseeing the state programs, share responsibility for ensuring that beneficiaries' health and welfare is protected. GAO was asked to examine state and federal oversight of assisted living services in Medicaid. This report (1) describes state spending on and coverage of these services, (2) describes how state Medicaid agencies oversee the health and welfare of beneficiaries in these settings, and (3) examines the extent that CMS oversees state Medicaid agency monitoring of assisted living services. GAO surveyed all state Medicaid agencies and interviewed officials in a nongeneralizeable sample of three states with varied oversight processes for their assisted living programs. GAO reviewed regulations and guidance, and interviewed CMS officials. State Medicaid agencies in 48 states that covered assisted living services reported spending more than $10 billion (federal and state) on assisted living services in 2014. These 48 states reported covering these services for more than 330,000 beneficiaries through more than 130 different programs. Most programs were operated under Medicaid waivers that allow states to target certain populations, limit enrollment, or restrict services to certain geographic areas. With respect to oversight of their largest assisted living programs, state Medicaid agencies reported varied approaches to overseeing beneficiary health and welfare, particularly in how they monitored critical incidents involving beneficiaries receiving assisted living services. State Medicaid agencies are required to protect beneficiary health and welfare and operate systems to monitor for critical incidents—cases of potential or actual harm to beneficiaries such as abuse, neglect, or exploitation. Twenty-six state Medicaid agencies could not report to GAO the number of critical incidents that occurred in assisted living facilities, citing reasons including the inability to track incidents by provider type (9 states), lack of a system to collect critical incidents (9 states), and lack of a system that could identify Medicaid beneficiaries (5 states). State Medicaid agencies varied in what types of critical incidents they monitored. All states identified physical, emotional, or sexual abuse as a critical incident. A number of states did not identify other incidents that may indicate potential harm or neglect such as medication errors (7 states) and unexplained death (3 states). State Medicaid agencies varied in whether they made information on critical incidents and other key information available to the public. Thirty-four states made critical incident information available to the public by phone, website, or in person, while another 14 states did not have such information available at all. Oversight of state monitoring of assisted living services by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is limited by gaps in state reporting. States are required to annually report to CMS information on deficiencies affecting beneficiary health and welfare for the most common program used to provide assisted living services. However, states have latitude in what they consider a deficiency. States also must describe their systems for monitoring critical incidents, but CMS does not require states to annually report data from their systems. Under federal internal control standards, agencies should have processes to identify information needed to achieve objectives and address risk. Without clear guidance on reportable deficiencies and no requirement to report critical incidents, CMS may be unaware of problems. For example, CMS found, after an in-depth review in one selected state seeking to renew its program, that the state lacked an effective system for assuring beneficiary health and welfare, including reporting insufficient information on the number of unexpected or suspicious beneficiary deaths. The state had not reported any deficiencies in annual reports submitted to CMS in 5 prior years. GAO recommendations to CMS include clarifying state requirements for reporting program deficiencies and requiring annual reporting of critical incidents. HHS concurred with GAO's recommendations to clarify deficiency reporting and stated that it would consider annual reporting requirements for critical incidents after completing an ongoing review."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6063}

The DOT's Office of Inspector General has reported, though, that FTA faces challenges in carrying out its enhanced safety oversight. FRA, also in DOT, has long carried out safety oversight of freight, intercity passenger, and commuter railroads. GAO was asked to review various rail safety and oversight issues, including the differences between FRA's and FTA's rail safety oversight programs. This report examines (1) key characteristics of FRA's and FTA's rail safety oversight programs and (2) strengths and limitations of FRA's and FTA's rail safety oversight programs. GAO assessed FRA's and FTA's information about rail safety oversight activities against guidance from the Office of Management and Budget, leading practices developed by the transit industry, and federal standards for internal control. GAO also interviewed stakeholders, including rail operators chosen based on mode, size, and location. The Department of Transportation's (DOT) Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and Federal Transit Administration (FTA) carry out different approaches to rail safety oversight. FRA has a more centralized safety oversight program for railroads, while FTA's program for oversight of rail transit safety largely relies on state safety agencies to monitor and enforce rail transit safety, as established in federal statute. Key characteristics of both programs include: (1) safety regulations, (2) inspections and other oversight activities, and (3) enforcement mechanisms to ensure that safety deficiencies are addressed (see figure). There are strengths and limitations to FRA's and FTA's approaches to their safety oversight missions, including how the two agencies develop safety regulations, conduct inspections, and carry out enforcement. The National Transportation Safety Board has reported, and stakeholders GAO spoke with generally agreed, that strengths of FRA's rail safety oversight program include its safety regulations, its risk-based inspection program, and its enforcement authorities. FRA also has potential limitations in its oversight framework, though, such as difficulty evaluating the effectiveness of its enforcement mechanisms. FTA has made some progress implementing changes to the rail transit safety program. However, FTA has not provided all the necessary guidance and support to states' safety agencies to ensure they develop appropriate and effective rail transit safety inspection programs. In particular, FTA has not provided states with guidance on how to develop and implement risk-based inspection programs. Though FTA has said that it will develop such guidance, it does not have a plan or timeline to do so. Without guidance from FTA on how to develop and carry out risk-based inspections, state safety agencies may not allocate their limited resources efficiently, and important safety issues may go undetected. In addition, FTA has not developed a process or methodology to evaluate whether state safety agency enforcement authorities and practices are effective. Without clear evidence that state safety agencies' enforcement is effective, states and FTA may not be able to compel rail transit operators to remedy safety deficiencies. As a result, deficiencies may remain for long periods, potentially contributing to safety incidents. GAO recommends that FTA (1) create a plan, with timeline, for developing risk-based inspection guidance for state safety agencies, and (2) develop and communicate a method for how FTA will monitor whether state safety agencies' enforcement practices are effective.

The program has evolved through multiple phases, initially using Space Act agreements for flexibility and later transitioning to FAR-based contracts to enable mission procurement. NASA has awarded contracts to Boeing and SpaceX, with the latter receiving a $2.6 billion contract and Boeing a $4.2 billion contract. The program requires contractors to meet ISS and Commercial Crew Program-specific safety and system requirements, with certification milestones that must be achieved before crewed missions can commence. Both contractors have faced significant delays, with certification milestones pushed to early 2019, and NASA's schedule risk analysis indicating potential further delays. The program has implemented a verification closure notice process to ensure contractors meet all requirements, but challenges remain in maintaining visibility into contractor progress without exacerbating schedule pressures. NASA has developed contingency plans, including purchasing additional Soyuz seats, but these may not be sufficient if delays persist. The program also faces challenges in assessing safety, particularly with the loss of crew metric, which is inconsistently applied across NASA. The program's safety technical authority is dual-hatted, creating potential conflicts of interest. NASA has not fully shared schedule risk information with Congress, and a contingency plan for beyond 2019 is still under development. The report recommends that NASA include schedule risk analysis in quarterly reports to Congress, develop a contingency plan, document risk tolerance for loss of crew, capture lessons learned, and restructure the safety technical authority to ensure independence.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this NASA Commercial Crew Program report. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report is about NASA's Commercial Crew Program, which started in 2010. The goal is to develop crew transportation systems to get the U.S. back to flying astronauts to the ISS without relying on Russia. They used different contract types, starting with Space Act agreements for flexibility and then moving to FAR-based contracts. The main contractors are Boeing and SpaceX, with contracts worth $4.2B and $2.6B respectively. \n\nThe program has phases, and the contractors have to meet certain requirements for ISS and safety. Certification milestones are crucial, and both Boeing and SpaceX have delayed their certification dates. The report mentions that NASA's schedule risk analysis shows more delays are likely, but they haven't shared this info with Congress. There's a", "answers": ["In 2014, NASA awarded two firm-fixed-price contracts to Boeing and SpaceX, worth a combined total of up to $6.8 billion, to develop crew transportation systems and conduct initial missions to the ISS. In February 2017, GAO found that both contractors had made progress, but their schedules were under mounting pressure. The contractors were originally required to provide NASA all the evidence it needed to certify that their systems met its requirements by 2017. A House report accompanying H.R. 5393 included a provision for GAO to review the progress of NASA's human exploration programs. This report examines the Commercial Crew Program, including (1) the extent to which the contractors have made progress towards certification and (2) how NASA's certification process addresses safety of the contractors' crew transportation systems. GAO analyzed contracts, schedules, and other documentation and spoke with officials from NASA, the Commercial Crew Program, Boeing, SpaceX, and two of NASA's independent review bodies that provide oversight. Both of the Commercial Crew Program's contractors, Boeing and Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX), are making progress finalizing designs and building hardware for their crew transportation systems, but both contractors continue to delay their certification milestone (see figure). Certification is the process that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will use to ensure that each contractor's system meets its requirements for human spaceflight for the Commercial Crew Program. Further delays are likely as the Commercial Crew Program's schedule risk analysis shows that the certification milestone is likely to slip. The analysis identifies a range for each contractor, with an earliest and latest possible completion date, as well as an average. The average certification date was December 2019 for Boeing and January 2020 for SpaceX, according to the program's April 2018 analysis. Since the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011, the United States has been relying on Russia to carry astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS). Additional delays could result in a gap in U.S. access to the space station as NASA has contracted for seats on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft only through November 2019. NASA is considering potential options, but it does not have a contingency plan for ensuring uninterrupted U.S. access. NASA's certification process addresses the safety of the contractors' crew transportation systems through several mechanisms, but there are factors that complicate the process. One of these factors is the loss of crew metric that was put in place to capture the probability of death or permanent disability to an astronaut. NASA has not identified a consistent approach for how to assess loss of crew. As a result, officials across NASA have multiple ways of assessing the metric that may yield different results. Consequently, the risk tolerance level that NASA is accepting with loss of crew varies based upon which entity is presenting the results of its assessment. Federal internal controls state that management should define risk tolerances so they are clear and measurable. Without a consistent approach for assessing the metric, the agency as a whole may not clearly capture or document its risk tolerance with respect to loss of crew. GAO is making five recommendations, including that NASA develop a contingency plan for ensuring a U.S. presence on the ISS and clarify how it will determine its risk tolerance for loss of crew. NASA concurred with three recommendations; partially concurred on the recommendation related to loss of crew; and non-concurred with a recommendation to report its schedule analysis to Congress.

In response to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, many new bank regulations were implemented pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act; P.L. 111-203) or under the existing authorities of bank regulators to address apparent weaknesses in the regulatory regime. While some observers view those changes as necessary and effective, others argued that certain regulations were unjustifiably burdensome. To address those concerns, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-174) relaxed certain regulations. Opponents of that legislation argue it unnecessarily pared back important safeguards, but proponents of deregulation argue additional pare backs are needed. Meanwhile, a variety of economic and technological trends continue to affect banks. As a result, the 116th Congress faces many issues related to banking, including the following: Safety and Soundness. Banks are subject to regulations designed to reduce the likelihood of bank failures. Examples include requirements to hold a certain amount of capital (which enables a bank to absorb losses without failing) and the so-called Volcker Rule (a ban on banks' proprietary trading). In addition, anti-money laundering requirements aim to reduce the likelihood banks will execute transactions involving criminal proceeds. Banks are also required to take steps to avoid becoming victims of cyberattacks. The extent to which these regulations (i) are effective, and (ii) appropriately balance benefits and costs is a matter of debate. Consumer Protection, Fair Lending, and Access to Banking. Certain laws are designed to protect consumers and ensure that lenders use fair lending practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has authorities to regulate for consumer protection. No consensus exists on whether current regulations strike an appropriate balance between protecting consumers while ensuring access to credit and justifiable compliance costs. In addition, whether Community Reinvestment Act regulations as currently implemented effectively and efficiently encourage banks to provide services in their areas of operation is an open question. Large Banks and \"Too Big To Fail.\" Regulators also regulate for systemic risks, such as those associated with very large and complex financial institutions that may contribute to systemic instability. Dodd-Frank Act provisions include enhanced prudential regulation for certain large banks and changes to resolution processes in the event one fails. In addition, bank regulators imposed additional capital requirements on certain large, complex banks. Subsequently, some argued that certain of these additional regulations were too broadly applied and overly stringent. In response, Congress reduced the applicability of the Dodd-Frank measures and regulators have proposed changes to the capital rules. Whether relaxing these rules will provide needed relief to these banks or unnecessarily pare back important safeguards is a debated issue. Community Banks. The number of small or \"community\" banks has declined substantially in recent decades. No consensus exists on the degree to which regulatory burden, market forces, and the removal of regulatory barriers to interstate branching and banking are causing the decline. What Companies Should Be Eligible for Bank Charters. To operate legally as a bank, an institution must hold a charter granted by a state or federal government. Traditionally, these are held by companies generally focused on and led by people with experience in finance. However, recently companies with a focus on technology are interested in having legal status as a bank, either through a charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or a state-level industrial loan company charter. Policymakers disagree over whether allowing these companies to operate as banks would create appropriately regulated providers of financial services or inappropriately extend government-backed bank safety nets and disadvantage existing banks. Recent Market and Economic Trends. Changing economic forces also pose issues for the banking industry. Some observers argue that increases in regulation could drive certain financial activities into a relatively lightly regulated \"shadow banking\" sector. Innovative financial technology may alter the way certain financial services are delivered. If interest rates rise, it could create opportunities and risks. Such trends could have implications for how the financial system performs and influence debates over appropriate banking regulations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12828}

However, the agreement faced significant challenges, including implementation delays, political opposition, and ongoing security threats from FARC dissidents and other armed groups. \n\nDespite the peace agreement, Colombia continues to grapple with the aftermath of the conflict, including the reintegration of former combatants, the protection of human rights, and the management of the country's complex security environment. The government has also faced challenges in addressing the humanitarian crisis caused by the influx of Venezuelan migrants, which has placed additional strain on Colombia's resources and infrastructure. \n\nEconomically, Colombia has made progress in reducing violence and promoting growth, but it remains heavily dependent on commodity exports, particularly oil, which has made it vulnerable to global market fluctuations.

Drug trafficking fueled the violence by funding both left-wing and right-wing armed groups. Some analysts feared Colombia would become a failed state in the late 1990s, but the Colombian government devised a new security strategy, known as Plan Colombia, to counter the insurgencies. Originally designed as a 6-year program, Plan Colombia ultimately became a 17-year U.S.-Colombian bilateral effort. The partnership focused initially on counternarcotics and later on counterterrorism; it then broadened to include sustainable development, human rights, trade, regional security, and many other areas of cooperation. Between FY2000 and FY2016, the U.S. Congress appropriated more than $10 billion to help fund Plan Colombia and its follow-on programs. For FY2018, Congress appropriated $391.3 million in foreign aid for Colombia, including assistance to promote peace and end the conflict. President Juan Manuel Santos (2010-2018) made concluding a peace accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)—the country's largest leftist guerrilla organization—his government's primary focus. Following four years of formal peace negotiations, Colombia's Congress ratified the FARC-government peace accord in November 2016. During a U.N.-monitored demobilization effort in 2017, approximately 11,000 FARC disarmed and demobilized. This figure included FARC who had been held in prison for crimes of rebellion and those making up FARC militias, who were accredited by the Colombian government as eligible to demobilize. On August 7, 2018, Iván Duque, a senator from the conservative Democratic Center party, was inaugurated to a four-year presidential term. Duque, who also worked at the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington, DC, and is Colombia's youngest president in a century, campaigned as a critic of the peace accord with the FARC. His party objected to specific measures concerning justice and political representation. Some observers maintain that his election has generated uncertainty for implementation of the accord. Shortly after taking office, Duque suspended peace talks with the National Liberation Army (ELN), the country's second-largest rebel group, which had begun under President Santos. Since the ratification of the peace accord, Colombia's long-term strategy has evolved from defeating insurgents to post-conflict stabilization. Many considered Plan Colombia and its successor strategies a remarkable advance, given the country's improvements in security and economic stability. Nevertheless, recent developments have called into question Colombia's progress. The FARC's demobilization has triggered open conflict among armed actors (including FARC dissidents and transnational criminal groups), which seek to control drug cultivation and trafficking, illegal mining, and other illicit businesses that the demobilized FARC abandoned. The ongoing lack of governance in remote rural areas recalls the conditions that originally gave rise to the FARC and other armed groups. Many observers continue to raise concerns about the country's human-rights conditions, sharp increases in coca cultivation and cocaine production, and problems stemming from the failing authoritarian government of neighboring Venezuela, which shares a nearly 1,400-mile border with Colombia. Venezuela's humanitarian crisis has set in motion an exodus of migrants, many of whom have sought temporary residence (or extended stays) in Colombia. Political upheaval has added yet more uncertainty after the United States and many other Western Hemisphere and European nations, including Colombia, called for a democratic transition in Venezuela and recognized the president of the Venezuelan National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, as the country's interim president in January 2019. The U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement went into force in May 2012. The United States remains Colombia's top trade partner.

The FAA's MPL process is crucial here. The report discusses how FAA calculates MPL values, which are used to set insurance requirements. They use three elements: number of casualties, cost of casualties, and property damage. \n\nThe FAA has updated some methods, like the risk profile method replacing the overlay method, and reduced the property damage factor from 50% to 25%. However, there are still issues. The cost of a casualty hasn't been updated since 1988, which might be too low. Also, the probability thresholds for risk distribution between the government and companies haven't been reviewed since the 1990s. \n\nThe report mentions that FAA didn't fully address all requirements under CSLCA, like balancing risk, evaluating cost impacts, and consulting with the industry. They didn't consult with the commercial space sector and insurance providers as required. The cost of casualties is a key component, and without updating it, the MPL might be understated, leading to insufficient insurance and higher federal exposure. \n\nThe recommendations include reevaluating probability thresholds, assessing cost impacts, consulting with stakeholders, and setting a timeline for guidance on methodology tools. The Department of Transportation concurred with the recommendations. \n\nNow, I need to condense all this into a one-page summary. Start with the purpose of the report, the MPL methodology, the changes made by FAA, the existing issues, the recommendations, and the conclusion. Make sure to highlight the key points without getting too detailed. Avoid jargon where possible, and keep it concise. Check for clarity and flow, ensuring each paragraph transitions smoothly. Also, mention the recommendations and the response from the Department of Transportation. Keep it under one page, so around 300-400 words. Let me structure it step by step.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of the report. Let me start by identifying the main points. The report discusses the FAA's Maximum Possible Loss (MPL) methodology for commercial space launches, which determines", "answers": ["The federal government shares liability risks with the commercial space launch industry for accidents that result in damages to third parties or federal property. This arrangement requires space launch companies to have a specific amount of insurance to cover these damages. The government is potentially liable for damages above that amount, up to a cap GAO estimated to be $3.1 billion in 2017, subject to appropriations in advance. CSLCA, enacted in 2015, directed the Department of Transportation, of which FAA is a part, to evaluate its MPL methodology and, if necessary, develop a plan to update that methodology. The act also included a provision requiring GAO to assess FAA's evaluation and any actions needed to update the methodology. This report discusses the extent to which (1) FAA's evaluation report addresses the requirements in CSLCA and (2) FAA has addressed previously identified weaknesses in the MPL methodology. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed FAA on its loss methodology evaluation and actions to address weaknesses. The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) report evaluating its maximum probable loss (MPL) methodology did not fully address the evaluation and consultation requirements specified by the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act (CSLCA). Balance of Risk. CSLCA required FAA to include ensuring that the federal government is not exposed to greater indemnification costs and that launch companies are not required to purchase more insurance coverage than necessary as a result of FAA's MPL methodology. FAA said that it ensured this balance by improving its methodology, but it did not reevaluate its probability thresholds after revising its methodology. These thresholds are used to divide the risk of loss between launch companies and the government. Impact on Costs. The act required FAA to consider the costs to both the industry and the federal government of implementing an updated methodology. FAA's report discussed the impact on indirect costs, such as data collection, but did not discuss direct costs: insurance premiums for launch companies and indemnification liability for the federal government. Consultation. The act also required FAA to consult with the commercial space sector and insurance providers in evaluating its MPL methodology in accordance with the preceding requirements. While the agency consulted with some stakeholders, these consultations were limited in scope. FAA officials said they have not been able to take the actions needed to fully satisfy the mandated elements because of issues such as resource limitations and the lack of available data. However, by not resolving these issues, FAA lacks assurance that launch companies are not purchasing more insurance than needed or that the federal government is not being exposed to greater indemnification costs than expected. FAA has addressed two of three previously identified weaknesses in its MPL methodology but has not yet dealt with the remaining weakness. Specifically, the agency has revised its methodology for estimating the number of potential casualties for a launch and changed the factor it uses to derive estimated property damage from estimated casualties. However, FAA has not updated the amount used for the cost of an individual casualty. GAO recommended in a March 2017 report (GAO-17-366) that FAA update this amount. Not doing so could understate the amount of insurance launch companies are required to purchase, exposing the federal government to excess risk. GAO also determined that while FAA has two tools and methods it can use in making its MPL estimates, it does not have guidance on determining which are most appropriate for a given launch scenario. For example, one tool is more comprehensive but also labor intensive to use, while the other is inappropriate for certain launch scenarios and could result in misleading MPL amounts. Officials said they have begun to create such guidance but do not have an estimated completion date. Without such guidance, FAA cannot ensure that the most appropriate MPL methodology is used for each launch. FAA should fully address mandated requirements in evaluating its MPL—probability thresholds, direct costs, and stakeholder consultations— and establish an estimated completion date for developing guidance on tools and methods to use for specific launch scenarios. The Department of Transportation concurred with the recommendations, and provided technical comments."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4125}

Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. \n\nThe report is from a government agency, probably GAO (Government Accountability Office), and it's about the Coast Guard's operations, missions, and challenges. The Coast Guard has a large staff and a fleet of aircraft and vessels. They're divided into geographic areas and districts. Their missions are outlined in the Homeland Security Act, with 11 statutory missions managed through six programs. They have performance goals and targets, but there are issues with data completeness, asset performance, and transparency.\n\nFirst, I should mention the structure of the Coast Guard: staff size, fleet, organizational structure. Then the 11 missions and the six programs. Next, the performance assessment process, including setting targets and the challenges with data. The report points out that some data is incomplete, especially regarding commercial fishing vessel accidents, which are a high-risk industry. The Coast Guard is trying to modernize with new vessels like the National Security Cutter and Fast Response Cutter, but there are affordability concerns and lack of long-term planning.\n\nThen there are specific recommendations from the GAO: improving data completeness, using realistic asset performance data, enhancing performance goal data reliability, increasing transparency of performance data, and improving capital planning transparency. The Coast Guard has agreed to some of these but needs to follow through. The report also mentions that the Coast Guard's Annual Performance Report hasn't been publicly released since 2011, affecting transparency.\n\nI need to condense all this into one page. Start with an introduction about the Coast Guard's role and structure. Then outline the missions and performance goals. Discuss the data issues and recommendations. Mention the modernization efforts and their challenges. Conclude with the need for transparency and long-term planning. Make sure to keep it concise, double-spaced, and within the one-page limit. Avoid too much technical jargon, but include key terms like statutory missions, performance goals, data limitations, asset modernization, etc. Check for flow and ensure each paragraph transitions smoothly. Also, make sure to highlight the recommendations and the Coast Guard's responses.

The Coast Guard has a large staff and fleet", "answers": ["The Coast Guard, a component of DHS, serves as the principal federal agency responsible for maritime safety, security, and environmental stewardship in U.S. ports and waterways. To ensure that the Coast Guard is effectively fulfilling its missions, agency managers must have accurate information and base decisions on sound analyses for effective program management. This statement discusses Coast Guard actions needed to (1) improve the quality of data used for program management and (2) improve the transparency of its data for reporting on mission performance and planning. This statement is based on relevant products GAO issued from June 2014 through December 2017 on Coast Guard strategic planning and management issues, as well as related recommendation follow-up conducted through February 2018. GAO reviewed applicable laws, regulations, policies and guidance. GAO also interviewed Coast Guard officials responsible for administering these programs and obtained information on how they used data to inform decisionmaking. GAO interviewed a range of stakeholders, including federal and industry officials. GAO's prior work recommended multiple actions to improve the Coast Guard's program management by improving the quality of data it uses to manage and report on its mission performance. Specifically, GAO recommended actions such as collecting more complete data and clarifying the data limitations to facilitate more effective program management. For example, in December 2017, GAO found that more information is needed to calculate vessel safety statistics that could enhance the Coast Guard's knowledge about accident, injury, and fatality trends involving commercial fishing vessels. Having more complete information could be useful to carrying out its marine safety mission, and GAO recommended, among other things, that the Coast Guard ensure that data collected during commercial fishing vessel incident investigations is accurately captured. In 2018, the Coast Guard reported taking initial steps to capture more accurate data. GAO's prior work also identified areas where the Coast Guard could improve the transparency of the data it uses for reporting on its mission performance as well its capital planning purposes. For example, in an October 2017 report on performance goals, GAO found the Coast Guard's Annual Performance Report (APR) has not been released publicly since 2011. Consequently, there has not been full visibility over performance across all of the Coast Guard's missions. Coast Guard officials stated that a decision by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership to limit the number of performance goals shared publicly had deterred the Coast Guard from public release of its APR. GAO recommended that APRs be available on the Coast Guard's website; the Coast Guard plans to publicly release future APRs. In addition, previous GAO reports found that the Coast Guard's annual 5-year capital investment plan, which projects acquisition funding needs for the upcoming 5 years, did not consistently reflect current total cost estimates or the effects of tradeoffs made as part of the annual budget cycle. GAO made recommendations to help the Coast Guard plan for future acquisitions and the difficult trade off decisions it will face given funding constraints. The Coast Guard agreed, but it is unclear when it will complete the 20-year plan. GAO is not making new recommendations in this statement but has made them to the Coast Guard and DHS in the past on improving its program management through, among other things, better quality and more transparent data.

{"pred": " The report provides an overview of the Small Business Act (SBA) and its role in promoting small business contracting opportunities within the federal government. Enacted in 1953, the SBA was established to ensure that small businesses receive a \"fair proportion\" of federal contracts, thereby preserving free competitive enterprise. The report outlines the various federal programs and requirements aimed at increasing small business participation in federal contracting, including the establishment of small business procurement goals, the setting aside of contracts for specific types of small businesses (such as 8(a) firms, HUBZone businesses, women-owned businesses, and service-disabled veteran-owned businesses), and the oversight mechanisms in place to ensure compliance with these policies.\n\nThe SBA administers several programs to support small businesses, including loan guaranty and venture capital programs, contracting programs to increase small business opportunities, direct loan programs for disaster recovery, and management and technical assistance training. The report also discusses the role of the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) in promoting small business contracting and the responsibilities of procurement officers and other federal agencies in implementing these policies.\n\nThe report highlights the importance of small business contracting programs in fostering market competition, local economic development, and job creation. It notes that these programs have strong bipartisan support but also acknowledges criticisms regarding their effectiveness and the impact of certain exclusions that limit their reach. The SBA's Small Business Goaling Report is used to track progress toward meeting federal procurement goals, although it has limitations in measuring the broader economic impacts of these programs.\n\nThe report concludes by emphasizing the need for continued oversight and potential reforms to enhance the effectiveness of small business contracting programs, particularly in areas such as the HUBZone program, where federal agencies have struggled to meet the 3% goal. It underscores the importance of these programs in supporting small businesses and promoting a robust, competitive economy.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report about the Small Business Act and federal contracting programs. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report begins by explaining the historical context of the Small Business Act (SBA) passed in 1953, which was a response to the challenges small businesses faced during WWII and the Korean War. The main goal was to ensure small businesses had fair access to federal contracts to preserve free enterprise. The SBA was established to help with this, and the report goes into detail about various programs and requirements that support small businesses in contracting with the federal government", "answers": ["Congress has broad authority to impose requirements upon the federal procurement process, that is, the process whereby agencies obtain goods and services from the private sector. One way in which Congress has exercised this authority is by adopting measures to promote contracting and subcontracting between \"small businesses\" and federal agencies. These measures, among other things, declare a congressional policy of ensuring that a \"fair proportion\" of federal contract and subcontract dollars is awarded to small businesses; establish government-wide and agency-specific goals for the percentage of federal contract and subcontract dollars awarded to small businesses; establish an annual Small Business Goaling Report to measure progress in meeting these goals; generally require federal agencies, under specified circumstances, to reserve contracts that have an anticipated value greater than the micro-purchase threshold (currently $10,000), but not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $250,000) exclusively for small businesses; authorize federal agencies, under specified circumstances, to set aside contracts that have an anticipated value greater than the simplified acquisition threshold exclusively for small businesses; authorize federal agencies to make sole source awards to small businesses when the award could not otherwise be made (e.g., only a single source is available, under urgent and compelling circumstances); authorize federal agencies to set aside contracts for, or grant other contracting preference to, specific types of small businesses (e.g., 8(a) small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, women-owned small businesses (WOSBs) and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs)); and task the Small Business Administration (SBA) and other federal procurement officers with reviewing and restructuring proposed procurements to maximize opportunities for small business participation. Small business contracting programs generally have strong bipartisan support. However, that does not mean that these programs face no opposition, or that issues have not been raised concerning the impact and operations of specific programs. For example, small business advocates note that implementing regulations in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) narrow the reach (and impact) of some small business contracting preferences by excluding specific types of contracts, such as those listed in the Federal Supply Schedules, from FAR requirements pertaining to small business contracting. Advocates want the federal government to enact policies that reduce or eliminate such exclusions. Critics have questioned some of these programs' effectiveness, in terms of both promoting small business opportunities to win federal contracts and promoting a more diversified, robust economy. Many observers judge the relative success or failure of federal efforts to enhance small business contracting opportunities by whether federal government and individual federal agencies meet the predetermined procurement goals in the annual Small Business Goaling Report. In recent years, the federal government has generally succeeded in meeting the government-wide goals of awarding 23% of the total value of all small business eligible prime contract awards to small businesses, 5% to small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs), and 3% to SDVOSBs. It has had difficulty meeting the goals of 5% to WOSBs and 3% to HUBZone small businesses. The Small Business Goaling Report is the most convenient measure available to compare federal small business contracting performance over time, but it has limitations. For example, the SBA excludes some contracts from the report in its determination of what is \"small business eligible\" and some federal procurement activities are not included because they are not recorded in the Federal Procurement Data System—Next Generation. It also does not evaluate the effect these contracts have on small businesses, industry competitiveness, or the overall economy."], "all_classes": null, "length": 9547}

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe LWCF Act of 1965 was created to help preserve and make outdoor recreation resources accessible. Its main goals are to promote recreation participation and improve public health. The fund gets $900 million annually from oil and gas leases on the Outer Continental Shelf, motorboat fuel taxes, and surplus sales. But these funds are only available if Congress appropriates them. There's also the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA) which adds mandatory funds for state grants. \n\nThe total revenue since 1965 is $40.9 billion, but only $18.9 billion has been appropriated through FY2019, leaving $22 billion unspent. The law requires at least 40% for federal purposes (like land acquisition) and 40% for state grants. The rest can be used for other purposes. \n\nOver the years, the fund has been used for federal land acquisition, state grants, and other purposes. The largest portion went to federal land acquisition ($11.4 billion), then state grants ($4.8 billion), and other purposes ($2.7 billion). \n\nThere's been debate about expanding the use of LWCF funds beyond land acquisition and state grants. Some want to use it for other programs like maintenance, infrastructure, or education. However, traditional advocates worry this might reduce funds for original purposes. \n\nThe report also details how appropriations for other purposes have varied. For example, in FY2001, there was a huge appropriation ($456 million) for the Lands Legacy Initiative, which funded many programs. But in recent years, it's been more limited, mainly for Forest Legacy and Endangered Species programs. \n\nI need to condense all this into a one-page summary. Start with the purpose of LWCF, funding sources, appropriation process, allocation of funds, historical use, debates over expanding uses, and recent trends.

The LWCF Act authorizes the fund to receive $900 million annually, with the monies available only if appropriated by Congress (i.e., discretionary appropriations). The fund also receives mandatory appropriations under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA). The level of annual appropriations for the LWCF has varied since the origin of the fund in FY1965. The LWCF Act outlines uses of the fund for federal and state purposes. Of the total made available through appropriations or deposits under GOMESA, not less than 40% is to be used for \"federal purposes\" and not less than 40% is to be used to provide \"financial assistance to states.\" The act lists the federal purposes for which the President is to allot LWCF funds \"unless otherwise allotted in the appropriation Act making them available.\" These purposes primarily relate to acquisition of lands and waters (and interests therein) by the federal government. With regard to state purposes, the act authorizes a matching grant program to states for outdoor recreation purposes. Throughout the LWCF's history, appropriations acts typically have provided funds for land acquisition and outdoor recreational grants to states. Beginning in FY1998, appropriations also have been provided each year (except FY1999) to fund other purposes related to natural resources. The extent to which the LWCF should be used for purposes other than federal land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants to states, and which other purposes should be funded from the LWCF, continue to be the subject of legislation and debate in Congress. In the past few decades, Presidents have sought LWCF funds for a variety of other purposes. Congress chooses which if any of these requests to fund, and has chosen programs not sought by the President for a particular year. Among other programs, appropriations have been provided for facility maintenance of the land management agencies, ecosystem restoration, the Historic Preservation Fund, the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, the Forest Legacy Program, State and Tribal Wildlife Grants (under the Fish and Wildlife Service), the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, U.S. Geological Survey science and cooperative programs, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Indian Land and Water Claim Settlements. Since FY1998, a total of $2.7 billion has been appropriated for other purposes, of a total LWCF appropriation of $18.9 billion over the history of the fund. The Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service have received the largest shares of the total appropriations for other purposes, about $1.4 billion (53%) and $1.0.billion (38%), respectively, from FY1998 to FY2019. Several agencies shared the remaining $0.2 billion (9%) of the appropriations. Both the dollar amounts and the percentages of annual LWCF appropriations for other purposes have varied widely since FY1998. The dollar amounts have ranged from $0 in FY1999 to $456.0 million in FY2001. The percentage of annual funds provided for other purposes ranged from 0% in FY1999 to a high of 59% in both FY2006 and FY2007. In some years, the appropriation for other purposes was significantly less than the Administration requested. For instance, for FY2008, the George W. Bush Administration sought $313.1 million; the appropriation was $101.3 million. The appropriation for other purposes last exceeded $100.0 million in FY2010, and most recently was $93.3 million, in FY2019. Prior to FY2008, several other purposes typically were funded each year from LWCF. Since FY2008, funds have been appropriated annually only for grants under two programs: Forest Legacy and Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund.

{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy government report about the Navy's readiness issues. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report mentions that since 2017, the Navy has had four major mishaps, resulting in 17 sailor deaths and significant ship damage. Three of these were collisions and a grounding, all involving ships based in Yokosuka, Japan. The Navy has reduced its fleet size by 17% since 1998, from 333 to 277 ships. Despite this reduction, the number of ships deployed overseas has stayed around 100, leading to increased deployment lengths. For example, carrier strike groups' deployments went from 6.4 months to 9 months. This has led to longer maintenance periods, less training, and declining ship conditions. \n\nThe report also talks about overseas homeporting, which the Navy uses for forward presence but comes with higher costs and reduced training. Ships in Japan, Spain, Bahrain, and Italy have had their training periods cut, leading to expired certifications and safety concerns. The Navy's Surface Force Readiness Manual emphasizes continuous readiness, but the report found that overseas ships don't have the same maintenance and training cycles as U.S.-based ones. \n\nThere's a section about crew manning. The Navy tried to reduce crew sizes to save costs, but this led to overwork and decreased ship conditions. The study found sailors were working 108 hours a week, exceeding the standard. The Navy hasn't fully addressed these issues, and there's a projected 30% fleet growth, which could strain resources further. \n\nMaintenance is a big problem. Shipyards are struggling with delays, poor conditions, and a lack of experienced workers. The Navy has extended readiness recovery goals to 2021 but hasn't set specific benchmarks. The report recommends reassessing overseas basing, crew workload, shipyard investments, and readiness planning. \n\nThe summary needs to be concise, covering the main issues: mishaps, fleet size reduction, deployment lengths, overseas homeporting challenges, crew manning issues, maintenance problems, and the recommendations. I should structure it into clear sections, maybe starting with the mishaps and fleet issues, then moving to overseas homeporting, crew manning, maintenance, and the recommendations. Make sure to", "answers": ["Since January 2017, the Navy has suffered four significant mishaps at sea that resulted in serious damage to its ships and the loss of 17 sailors. Three of these incidents involved ships homeported in Japan. In response to these incidents, the Chief of Naval Operations ordered an operational pause for all fleets worldwide, and the Vice Chief of Naval Operations directed a comprehensive review of surface fleet operations, stating that these tragic incidents are not limited occurrences but part of a disturbing trend in mishaps involving U.S. ships. This statement provides information on the effects of homeporting ships overseas, reducing crew size on ships, and not completing maintenance on time on the readiness of the Navy and summarizes GAO recommendations to address the Navy's maintenance, training, and other challenges. In preparing this statement, GAO relied on work it has published since 2015 related to the readiness of ships homeported overseas, sailor training and workload issues, maintenance challenges, and other issues. GAO updated this information, as appropriate, based on Navy data. GAO's prior work shows that the Navy has increased deployment lengths, shortened training periods, and reduced or deferred maintenance to meet high operational demands, which has resulted in declining ship conditions and a worsening trend in overall readiness. The Navy has stated that high demand for presence has put pressure on a fleet that is stretched thin across the globe. Some of the concerns that GAO has highlighted include: Degraded readiness of ships homeported overseas: Since 2006, the Navy has doubled the number of ships based overseas. Overseas basing provides additional forward presence and rapid crisis response, but GAO found in May 2015 that there were no dedicated training periods built into the operational schedules of the cruisers and destroyers based in Japan. As a result, the crews of these ships did not have all of their needed training and certifications. Based on updated data, GAO found that, as of June 2017, 37 percent of the warfare certifications for cruiser and destroyer crews based in Japan—including certifications for seamanship—had expired. This represents more than a fivefold increase in the percentage of expired warfare certifications for these ships since GAO's May 2015 report. The Navy has made plans to revise operational schedules to provide dedicated training time for overseas-based ships, but this schedule has not yet been implemented. Crew size reductions contribute to sailor overwork and safety risks: GAO found in May 2017 that reductions to crew sizes the Navy made in the early 2000s were not analytically supported and may now be creating safety risks. The Navy has reversed some of those changes but continues to use a workweek standard that does not reflect the actual time sailors spend working and does not account for in-port workload—both of which have contributed to some sailors working over 100 hours a week. Inability to complete maintenance on time: Navy recovery from persistently low readiness levels is premised on adherence to maintenance schedules. However, in May 2016, GAO found that the Navy was having difficulty completing maintenance on time. Based on updated data, GAO found that, in fiscal years 2011 through 2016, maintenance overruns on 107 of 169 surface ships (63 percent) resulted in 6,603 lost operational days (i.e., the ships were not available for training and operations). Looking to the future, the Navy wants to grow its fleet by as much as 30 percent but continues to face challenges with manning, training, and maintaining its existing fleet. These readiness problems need to be addressed and will require the Navy to implement GAO's recommendations—particularly in the areas of assessing the risks associated with overseas basing, reassessing sailor workload and the factors used to size ship crews, managing investments to modernize and improve the efficiency of the naval shipyards, and applying sound planning and sustained management attention to its readiness rebuilding efforts. In addition, continued congressional oversight will be needed to ensure that the Navy demonstrates progress in addressing its maintenance, training, and other challenges. GAO made 14 recommendations in prior work cited in this statement. The Department of Defense generally concurred with all of them but has implemented only 1.

{"pred": " The report examines the complexities of taxing the digital economy, focusing on the emergence of \"digital services taxes\" (DSTs) in Europe and the U.S. opposition to these unilateral measures. It highlights that digital economy businesses operate in \"two-sided markets,\" providing services to users and businesses, often generating revenue without a physical presence in the taxing jurisdiction. Proponents of DSTs argue that multinational corporations (MNCs) are not paying their \"fair share\" of taxes due to their ability to avoid permanent establishments and shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions. The report discusses the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, which aims to address these issues by redefining tax principles, such as taxing profits where value is created, including user interactions. However, the U.S. and some European countries oppose DSTs, citing concerns about tax competition and the potential for distortions in global markets. The report also analyzes the economic implications of DSTs, noting that they are more akin to excise taxes on revenue rather than taxes on corporate profits. It argues that DSTs could lead to inefficiencies, reduced investment, and regressive impacts on consumers. The report concludes that while DSTs may address perceived tax imbalances, they risk creating administrative challenges, inequitable treatment of firms, and potential violations of international trade agreements. It suggests that broader international reforms, such as formulary apportionment, may be more effective in addressing the challenges of taxing the digital economy.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points. \n\nThe report is about the digital economy and how it's being taxed, especially focusing on DSTs in Europe. The main points seem to be: \n\n1. **Digital Economy and DSTs**: The digital economy involves businesses that operate in two-sided markets, serving users and businesses. These companies often generate revenue without a physical presence in the taxing country. DSTs are taxes on these digital services, proposed by some European countries.\n\n2. **Reasons for DSTs**: Proponents argue that MNCs aren't paying their fair share because they can avoid permanent establishments and shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions. The European Commission and some countries like France and the UK are pushing for DSTs, citing user-generated value and the need to align tax with where value is created.\n\n3. **U.S. Opposition**: The U.S. and some European officials oppose DSTs, calling them politically motivated", "answers": ["Several countries, primarily in Europe, and the European Commission have proposed or adopted taxes on revenue earned by multinational corporations (MNCs) in certain \"digital economy\" sectors from activities linked to the user-based activity of their residents. These proposals have generally been labeled as \"digital services taxes\" (DSTs). For example, beginning in 2019, Spain is imposing a DST of 3% on online advertising, online marketplaces, and data transfer service (i.e., revenue from sales of user activities) within Spain. Only firms with €750 million in worldwide revenue and €3 million in revenues with users in Spain are to be subject to the tax. In 2020, the UK plans to implement a 3% DST that would apply only to businesses whose revenues exceed £25 million per year and groups that generate global revenues from search engines, social media platforms, and online marketplaces in excess of £500 million annually. The UK labels its DST as an \"interim\" solution until international tax rules are modified to allow countries to tax the profits of foreign MNCs if they have a substantial enough \"digital presence\" based on local users. The member states of the European Commission are also actively considering such a rule. These policies are being considered and enacted against a backdrop of ongoing, multilateral negotiations among members and nonmembers of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). These negotiations, prompted by discussions of the digital economy, could result in significant changes for the international tax system. Proponents of DSTs argue that digital firms are \"undertaxed.\" This sentiment is driven in part by some high-profile tech companies that reduced the taxes they paid by assigning ownership of their income-producing intangible assets (e.g., patents, marketing, and trade secrets) to affiliate corporations in low-tax jurisdictions. Proponents of DSTs also argue that the countries imposing tax should be entitled to a share of profits earned by digital MNCs because of the \"value\" to these business models made by participation of their residents through their content, reviews, purchases, and other contributions. Critics of DSTs argue that the taxes target income or profits that would not otherwise be subject to taxation under generally accepted income tax principles. U.S. critics, in particular, see DSTs as an attempt to target U.S. tech companies, especially as minimum thresholds are high enough that only the largest digital MNCs (such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon) will be subject to these specific taxes. DSTs are structured as a selective tax on revenue (akin to an excise tax) and not as a tax on corporate profits. A tax on corporate profits taxes the return to investment in the corporate sector. Corporate profit is equal to total revenue minus total cost. In contrast, DSTs are \"turnover taxes\" that apply to the revenue generated from taxable activities regardless of costs incurred by a firm. Additionally, international tax rules do not allow countries to tax an MNC's cross-border income solely because their residents purchase goods or services provided by that firm. Rather, ownership of assets justifies a country to be allocated a share of that MNC's profits to tax. Under these rules and their underlying principles, the fact that a country's residents purchase digital services from an MNC is not a justification to tax the MNC's profits. DSTs are likely to have the economic effect of an excise tax on intermediate services. The economic incidence of a DST is likely to be borne by purchasers of taxable services (e.g., companies paying digital economy firms for advertising, marketplace listings, or user data) and possibly consumers downstream from those transactions. As a result, economic theory and the general body of empirical research on excise taxes predict that DSTs are likely to increase prices in affected markets, decrease quantity supplied, and reduce investment in these sectors. Compared to a corporate profits tax—which, on balance, tends to be borne by higher-income shareholders—DSTs are expected to be more regressive forms of raising revenue, as they affect a broad range of consumer goods and services. Certain design features of DSTs could also create inequitable treatment between firms and increase administrative complexity. For example, minimum revenue thresholds could be set such that primarily large, foreign (and primarily U.S.) corporations are subject to tax. Requirements to identify the location of users could also introduce significant costs on businesses. This report traces the emergence of DSTs from multilateral tax negotiations in recent years, addresses various purported policy justifications of DSTs, provides an economic analysis of their effects, and raises several issues for Congress."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12505}
{"pred": " (One page, 250-300 words)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about commercial disclosure requirements and the First Amendment. Let me start by understanding the main points.\n\nThe report discusses how the First Amendment applies to laws that require businesses to disclose certain information to consumers. It mentions that while the First Amendment protects against compelled speech, commercial speech is treated differently. The Supreme Court has upheld some disclosure laws because commercial speech is given less protection than other types of speech. \n\nThe key cases mentioned are Virginia State Board of Pharmacy (1976) and Central Hudson (1980), which established that commercial speech can be regulated more freely. The report explains that disclosure requirements are often analyzed under different standards: strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, or the Zauderer standard, which is more lenient. \n\nZauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel (1985) is highlighted as a case where the Court allowed disclosure requirements if they are factual, uncontroversial, and related to the goods or services. However, recent cases like NIFLA (2018) suggest that the Court is applying stricter scrutiny, especially if the disclosure is not clearly factual or if the government's interest isn't well-supported. \n\nThe report also notes that the Supreme Court is moving towards a more skeptical view of commercial speech regulations, possibly applying strict scrutiny in some cases. Lower courts are split on how to apply these standards, and there's a trend towards requiring more evidence that the disclosure is necessary to prevent deception. \n\nI need to condense all this into a concise summary. Start with the main idea: the tension between First Amendment protections and commercial disclosure laws. Mention the different standards (strict, intermediate, Zauderer), the key cases, and the recent shift towards more scrutiny. Highlight the factors that determine which standard applies, like whether the disclosure is factual and related to the service. Also, note the implications for future regulations and the need for evidence supporting the government's interest. Make sure to keep it within one page, around 250-300 words, and avoid jargon. Check for clarity and flow.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of the report. Let me start by outlining the key points.

These disclosure provisions require commercial actors to make statements that they otherwise might not, compelling speech and implicating the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. Nonetheless, while commercial disclosure requirements may regulate protected speech, that fact in and of itself does not render such provisions unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has historically allowed greater regulation of commercial speech than of other types of speech. Since at least the mid-1970s, however, the Supreme Court has been increasingly protective of commercial speech. This trend, along with other developments in First Amendment law, has led some commentators to question whether the Supreme Court might apply a stricter test in assessing commercial disclosure requirements in the near future. Nonetheless, governing Supreme Court precedent provides that disclosure requirements generally receive lesser judicial scrutiny when they compel only commercial speech, as opposed to noncommercial speech. In National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra, a decision released in June 2018, the Supreme Court explained that it has applied a lower level of scrutiny to compelled disclosures under two circumstances. First, the Supreme Court has sometimes upheld laws that regulate commercial speech if the speech regulation is part of a larger regulatory scheme that is focused on conduct and only incidentally burdens speech. If a law is properly characterized as a regulation of conduct, rather than speech, then it may be subject to rational basis review, a deferential standard that asks only whether the regulation is a rational way to address the problem. However, it can be difficult to distinguish speech from conduct, and the Supreme Court has not frequently invoked this doctrine to uphold laws against First Amendment challenges. Second, the Supreme Court has sometimes applied a lower level of scrutiny to certain commercial disclosure requirements under the authority of a 1985 case, Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel. In Zauderer, the Court upheld a disclosure requirement after noting that the challenged provision compelled only \"factual and uncontroversial information about the terms under which . . . services will be available.\" The Court said that under the circumstances, the service provider's First Amendment rights were sufficiently protected because the disclosure requirement was \"reasonably related\" to the government's interest \"in preventing deception of consumers.\" Lower courts have generally interpreted Zauderer to mean that if a commercial disclosure provision requires only \"factual and uncontroversial information\" about the goods or services being offered, it should be analyzed under rational basis review. If a commercial disclosure requirement does not qualify for review under Zauderer, then it will most likely be analyzed under the intermediate standard that generally applies to government actions that regulate commercial speech. Some legal scholars have argued that recent Supreme Court case law suggests the Court may subject commercial disclosure provisions to stricter scrutiny in the future, either by limiting the factual circumstances under which these two doctrines apply or by creating express exceptions to these doctrines. If a court applies a heightened level of scrutiny, it may require the government to present more evidence of the problem it is seeking to remedy and stronger justifications for choosing a disclosure requirement to achieve its purposes."], "all_classes": null, "length": 9534}

Let me start by reading through the report to understand the main points. The report is about the U.S. involvement in Afghanistan's security and governance since 2001, focusing on the Resolute Support mission and the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF). \n\nFirst, the U.S. has two missions: a counterterrorism mission and the NATO-led Resolute Support. The goal is to build self-sustaining Afghan security forces. The report mentions that the security situation has deteriorated since the 2015 transition to Afghan-led security, with a high number of incidents in 2017. The U.S. contributes a significant portion of the personnel and funding for the ANDSF, which includes both conventional and specialized forces. \n\nThe ANDSF has improved in some areas, like operational planning and coordination between ministries, but there are still capability gaps. The specialized forces, like the Afghan Special Security Forces and the Afghan Air Force, are more capable than the conventional forces. The report highlights that the ANDSF relies on coalition support for maintenance and logistics, and there's a plan to increase the size of specialized forces by 2020. \n\nHowever, the U.S. and coalition forces lack reliable data on the conventional forces' ability to maintain equipment, which makes it hard to assess their readiness. The report also mentions that the ANDSF Roadmap aims to improve fighting capabilities, leadership, and counter-corruption. There are initiatives like the National Maintenance Strategy and the Security Force Assistance Brigade to address these gaps. \n\nThe main challenges include capability gaps in logistics, intelligence, and equipment sustainment. The report recommends that the Department of Defense develop methods to collect reliable information on the conventional forces' operational capabilities. \n\nNow, I need to condense all this into a one-page summary. I should start with the purpose of the report, the U.S. missions, the ANDSF structure, their progress and gaps, the initiatives to improve them, and the recommendations. I need to be concise, using bullet points or short paragraphs. Also, make sure to mention the financial aspects, the role of coalition support, and the specific examples like the MD-530 helicopters and radios. Avoid too much detail but cover the key points. Check for clarity and ensure that the summary flows logically from the problem to the efforts and recommendations.\nOkay,", "answers": ["Developing independently capable ANDSF is a key component of U.S. and coalition efforts to create sustainable security and stability in Afghanistan under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)-led Resolute Support mission. The United States is the largest contributor of funding and personnel to Resolute Support, providing and maintaining ANDSF equipment, along with training, advising, and assistance to help the ANDSF effectively use and sustain the equipment in the future. House Report 114-537 included a provision for GAO to review the ANDSF's capability and capacity to operate and sustain U.S.-purchased weapon systems and equipment. This report addresses (1) what has been reported about ANDSF capabilities and capability gaps and (2) the extent to which DOD has information about the ANDSF's ability to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment. To conduct this work, GAO analyzed DOD and NATO reports and documents, examined three critical equipment types, and interviewed DOD officials in the United States and Afghanistan. This is a public version of a sensitive report issued in September 2018. Information that DOD deemed sensitive has been omitted. Since the Resolute Support mission began in 2015, the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) have improved some fundamental capabilities, such as high-level operational planning, but continue to rely on U.S. and coalition support to fill several key capability gaps, according to Department of Defense (DOD) reporting. DOD has initiatives to address some ANDSF capability gaps, such as a country-wide vehicle maintenance and training effort, but DOD reports it does not expect the ANDSF to develop and sustain independent capabilities in some areas, such as logistics, for several years. While DOD has firsthand information on the abilities of the Afghan Air Force and Special Security Forces to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment, it has little reliable information on the equipment proficiency of conventional ANDSF units. U.S. and coalition advisors are embedded at the tactical level for the Air Force and Special Security Forces, enabling DOD to directly assess those forces' abilities. However, the advisors have little direct contact with conventional ANDSF units on the front lines. As a result, DOD relies on those units' self-assessments of tactical abilities, which, according to DOD officials, can be unreliable. GAO's analysis of three critical equipment types illustrated the varying degrees of DOD's information (see figure above). For example, DOD provided detailed information about the Air Force's ability to operate and maintain MD-530 helicopters and the Special Security Forces' ability to operate and maintain Mobile Strike Force Vehicles; however, DOD had limited information about how conventional forces operate and maintain radios and Mobile Strike Force Vehicles. DOD's lack of reliable information on conventional forces' equipment operations and maintenance abilities adds to the uncertainty and risk in assessing the progress of DOD efforts in Afghanistan.

CAPTA requires states to submit plans outlining how they will use funds to enhance their systems, and to submit annual data reports on child abuse and neglect cases. The report highlights the impact of the opioid epidemic on the rise in neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) and the challenges states face in addressing the needs of substance-affected infants. Under CAPTA, states must have policies to address infants affected by prenatal substance abuse, including ensuring health care providers notify child protective services (CPS) and developing plans of safe care for these infants. The report notes that while most states have policies in place, there is variability in how they define and implement these requirements. Some states require health care providers to report substance-affected infants, while others rely on mandated reporter laws. The report also discusses the challenges states face in developing and monitoring plans of safe care, including resource limitations, confidentiality issues, and the need for more clarity on what constitutes a plan of safe care. The report highlights the role of the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in providing technical assistance to states. Despite these efforts, many states report confusion about CAPTA requirements and a need for additional guidance. The report concludes that while CAPTA provides a framework for addressing the needs of substance-affected infants, more specific guidance and technical assistance from HHS are needed to ensure effective implementation and better support for these vulnerable children and families.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report on CAPTA. Let me start by understanding the main points. The report is about the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), which provides federal grants to states to improve child protective services. It mentions that CAPTA requires states to submit plans and annual data reports. The opioid epidemic has led to an increase in neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), which is a big part of the report. \n\nThe report talks about how states must have policies to address substance-affected infants, including health care providers notifying CPS. There's a part about the definition of \"plans of safe care,\" which isn't clearly defined in CAPTA, leading to confusion. Some states have different approaches—some require reporting, others rely on mandated reporter laws. \n\nThere are challenges mentioned, like resource limitations, confidentiality issues, and the need for more clarity on what a plan of safe care entails. The federal", "answers": ["Under CAPTA, states perform a range of prevention activities, including addressing the needs of infants born with prenatal drug exposure. The number of children under the age of 1 entering foster care increased by about 15 percent from fiscal years 2012 through 2015. Child welfare professionals attribute the increase to the opioid epidemic. GAO was asked to examine the steps states are taking to implement CAPTA requirements on substance-affected infants and related amendments enacted in 2016. This report examines (1) the extent to which states have adopted policies and procedures to notify CPS of substance-affected infants; (2) state efforts to develop plans of safe care, and associated challenges; and (3) steps HHS has taken to help states implement the provisions. To obtain this information, GAO surveyed state CPS directors in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and reached a 100 percent response rate. GAO also visited 3 states (Kentucky, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania); reviewed relevant documents such as federal laws and regulations, and HHS guidance; and interviewed HHS officials. GAO did not assess states' compliance with CAPTA requirements. All states reported adopting, to varying degrees, policies and procedures regarding health care providers notifying child protective services (CPS) about infants affected by opioids or other substances. Under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), as amended, governors are required to provide assurances that the states have laws or programs that include policies and procedures to address the needs of infants affected by prenatal substance use. This is to include health care providers notifying CPS of substance-affected infants. In response to GAO's survey, 42 states reported having policies and procedures that require health care providers to notify CPS about substance-affected infants and 8 states reported having policies that encourage notification. The remaining 1 state has a policy requiring health care providers to assess the needs of mothers and infants and if they conclude that infants are at risk for abuse or neglect, CPS is notified. In response to GAO's survey, 49 states reported that their CPS agency has policies to develop a plan of safe care; 2 reported not having such a requirement. Under CAPTA, states are required to develop a plan of safe care for substance-affected infants. Although not defined in law, a plan of safe care generally entails an assessment of the family's situation and a plan for connecting families to appropriate services to stabilize the family and ensure the child's safety and well-being. States reported that plans typically address the infant's safety needs, immediate medical needs, and the caregiver's substance use treatment needs. However, officials in the 3 states GAO visited noted challenges, including uncertainty about what to include in plans and the level of intervention needed for infants at low risk of abuse or neglect. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has provided technical assistance and guidance to states to implement these CAPTA requirements. Most states reported in GAO's survey that additional guidance and assistance would be very or extremely helpful for addressing their challenges. Nevertheless, HHS officials told GAO that the agency does not anticipate issuing additional written guidance, but that states can access technical assistance through their regional offices and the National Center on Substance Abuse and Child Welfare—a resource center funded by HHS. However, of the 37 states that reported on the helpfulness of the assistance they have received, 19 said it was only moderately helpful to not helpful. States offered suggestions for improving the assistance, such as developing substance abuse training materials for staff and holding video conferences with other states to share information. In October 2017, HHS officials explained that some states have submitted plans that include details on how they are addressing the CAPTA requirements. HHS officials reported that some of the plans submitted to date indicated that states are not meeting the requirements and those states have been asked to develop program improvement plans. Without more specific guidance and assistance to enhance states' understanding of CAPTA requirements and better address known challenges such as the ones described in this report, states may miss an opportunity to provide more effective protections and services for the children and families most in need.

However, some projects have been adversely affected, with delays or reduced scope. The report also notes that USAID's current reporting mechanisms do not capture these challenges, limiting the agency's ability to address them effectively. Despite efforts by Treasury and State to improve access through guidance and dialogue, USAID has limited engagement on these issues. The report recommends that USAID collect and communicate information on banking access challenges to better support its partners and mitigate risks.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report. Let me start by understanding the main points. The report is about banking access challenges faced by USAID and State partners in humanitarian assistance projects, especially in high-risk countries. \n\nFirst, the report explains how funds are transferred through correspondent banks, but there's a decline in these relationships, especially for high-risk jurisdictions. This affects international payments and could lead to financial crimes. Then, it talks about BSA/AML regulations that U.S. banks must follow, which can create barriers for NPOs and charities.\n\nThe study found that many NPOs face banking access issues like transfer delays, account closures, and increased fees. However, most partners mitigate these issues with strategies like maintaining buffers or using alternative methods. Some projects were affected, but not all. The report also mentions that USAID's reporting systems don't capture these challenges, so they aren't fully aware of the risks. \n\nThere's a part about Treasury and State working on solutions, like guidance and roundtable meetings, but USAID isn't as involved.

GAO was asked to review the possible effects of decreased banking access for nonprofit organizations on the delivery of U.S. humanitarian assistance. In this report, GAO examines (1) the extent to which State and USAID partners experienced banking access challenges, (2) USAID partners' reporting on such challenges, and (3) actions U.S. agencies have taken to help address such challenges. GAO selected four high-risk countries—Syria, Somalia, Haiti, and Kenya—based on factors such as their inclusion in multiple financial risk-related indices, and selected a non-generalizable sample of 18 projects in those countries. GAO reviewed documentation and interviewed U.S. officials and the 18 partners for the selected projects. Implementing partners (partners) for 7 of 18 Department of State (State) and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) humanitarian assistance projects that GAO selected noted encountering banking access challenges, such as delays or denials in transferring funds overseas. Of those 7 projects, 1 partner told us that banking access challenges adversely affected its project and 2 additional partners told us that the challenges had the potential for adverse effects. Moreover, the majority of partners (15 out of 18) for the 18 projects noted experiencing banking access challenges on their global portfolio of projects over the previous 5 years. USAID's partners' written reports do not capture potential risks posed by banking access challenges because USAID generally does not require most partners to report in writing any challenges that do not affect implementation. Six of the 7 projects that encountered challenges were USAID-funded. Of those 6 USAID projects, 5 partners told us that these challenges did not rise to the threshold of affecting project implementation that would necessitate reporting, and 1 did not report challenges although its project was adversely affected. Additionally, GAO's review of about 1,300 USAID partner reports found that the few instances where challenges were mentioned lacked sufficient detail for GAO to determine their type, severity, or origin. Without information on banking access challenges that pose potential risks to project implementation, USAID is not aware of the full extent of risks to achieving its objectives. The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and State have taken various actions to help address banking access challenges encountered by nonprofit organizations (NPO), but USAID's efforts have been limited. Treasury's efforts have focused on engagement between NPOs and U.S. agencies, while State has issued guidance on the topic to its embassies and designated an office to focus on these issues. In contrast, USAID lacks a comparable office, and NPOs stated that it is difficult to find USAID staff to engage with on this topic. Further, GAO found that awareness of specific challenges was generally limited to USAID staff directly overseeing the project. Without communicating these challenges to relevant parties, USAID may not be aware of all risks to agency objectives and may not be able to effectively engage with external entities on efforts to address these challenges.

The EFMP requires each military service to establish its own program with three components: identification and enrollment, assignment coordination, and family support. While DOD has established policies and oversight through the Office of Special Needs (OSN), there are significant variations in how the services implement these components, leading to inconsistent support for families. The report highlights that the number of services plans (SPs) created for families with special needs is relatively low compared to the number of enrolled families, and the Services have not fully developed standardized procedures for family support. Additionally, the lack of common performance metrics and systematic evaluation processes hampers DOD’s ability to assess the effectiveness of the EFMP across services. The report recommends that DOD develop common performance metrics, ensure sufficient resources for family support providers, and implement a systematic process for evaluating monitoring activities.

This report examines the extent to which (1) each Service provides family support and (2) the Services monitor and DOD evaluates assignment coordination and family support. GAO analyzed DOD and Service-specific EFMP guidance and documents; analyzed fiscal year 2016 EFMP data (the most recent available); visited seven military installations, selected for their large numbers of military-connected students; and interviewed officials responsible for implementing each Service's EFMP, as well as officials in OSN that administer DOD's EFM policy. The support provided to families with special needs through the Department of Defense's (DOD) Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) varies widely for each branch of Military Service. Federal law requires DOD's Office of Special Needs (OSN) to develop a uniform policy that includes requirements for (1) developing and updating a services plan for each family with special needs and (2) resources, such as staffing, to ensure an appropriate number of family support providers. OSN has developed such a policy, but DOD relies on each Service to determine its compliance with the policy. However, Army and Navy officials said they have not received feedback from OSN about the extent to which their Service-specific guidance complies. Federal internal control standards call for developing clear policies to achieve agency goals. In addition, DOD's most recent annual reports to Congress do not indicate the extent to which each Service provides services plans or allocates sufficient resources for family support providers. According to GAO's analysis, the Military Services have developed relatively few services plans, and there is wide variation in the number of family support providers employed, which raises questions about potential gaps in services for families with special needs (see table). Each Service uses various mechanisms to monitor how servicemembers are assigned to installations (assignment coordination) and obtain family support, but DOD has not established common performance measures to assess these activities. DOD has taken steps to better support families with special needs, according to the DOD officials GAO interviewed. For example, DOD established a working group to identify gaps in services. However, OSN officials said that DOD lacks common performance measures for assignment coordination and family support because the Services have not reached consensus on what those measures should be. In addition, OSN does not have a process to systematically evaluate the results of the Services' monitoring activities. Federal internal control standards call for assessing performance over time and evaluating the results of monitoring activities. Without establishing common performance measures and assessing monitoring activities, DOD will be unable to fully determine the effect of its efforts to better support families with special needs and the adequacy of the Services' EFMPs as required by federal law. GAO makes a total of three recommendations to DOD. DOD should assess and report to Congress on the extent to which each Service provides sufficient family support personnel and services plans, develop common performance metrics for assignment coordination and family support, and evaluate the results of the Services' monitoring activities.

The purpose of the sunshield is to protect the telescope's mirrors and instruments from the sun's heat. NASA found that hardware on the cover came loose during testing in April 2018. The new cost estimate of $9.7 billion is driven by the schedule extension, which requires keeping the contractor's workforce on board longer than expected. Before the project enters its final phase of integration and test, it must conduct a review to determine if it can launch within its cost and schedule commitments. As part of this review, the project is not required to update its joint cost and schedule confidence level analysis—an analysis that provides the probability the project can meet its cost and schedule commitments—but government and industry cost and schedule experts have found it is a best practice to do so. Such analysis would provide NASA officials with better information to support decisions on allocating resources, especially in light of the project's recent cost and schedule growth. NASA has taken steps to improve oversight and performance of JWST, and identified the JWST project manager as responsible for monitoring the continued implementation of these changes. Examples of recent changes include increasing on-site presence at the contractor facility and conducting comprehensive audits of design processes. Sustaining focus on these changes through launch will be important if schedule pressures arise later and because of past challenges with communications. GAO will follow up on the project's monitoring of these improvements in future reviews. GAO recommends NASA update the project's joint cost and schedule confidence level analysis. NASA concurred with the recommendation made in this report."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5967}
{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report about U.S. child nutrition programs. Let me start by reading through the report again to get the main points. \n\nThe report starts by explaining that child nutrition programs are run by USDA-FNS and include several key programs like NSLP, SBP, FFVP, and SMP. It mentions the HHFKA of 2010, which reauthorized these programs and set nutrition standards. Then there's a part about the reauthorization efforts in the 114th and 115th Congresses, which didn't pass. The report also talks about the nutrition standards, like the changes in milk, whole grains, and sodium requirements over time. There's a section on the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP) and the debate over using non-fresh produce. Then there's the Buy American requirements for sourcing foods domestically, and the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) with alternatives like Summer EBT. The Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) is discussed, along with issues like unpaid meal costs and lunch shaming. Finally, there's the paid lunch equity requirements from the HHFKA.\n\nSo, the summary needs to cover all these points concisely. Let me structure it: start with an overview of the programs, mention the HHFKA and its impact, then the reauthorization attempts, nutrition standards and their changes, FFVP and sourcing, Buy American, summer meal programs, CEP, unpaid meals and lunch shaming, and paid lunch equity. I should also note the stakeholders involved and the legislative proposals. Need to keep it to one page, so each section should be a brief paragraph. Make sure to highlight key issues like the nutritional standards, challenges in implementation, and the ongoing debates. Avoid too much detail on each program but ensure all major points are covered. Check for any important statistics or dates, like the 2010 Act, the 2018 farm bill, and the CEP participation numbers. Also, mention the current status of reauthorization efforts and the issues that might come up in future legislation. Alright, time to put this all together in a coherent, concise summary.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of the report. Let me start by outlining the key sections and main points. The report discusses various USDA-FNS child nutrition programs, their reauthorization, nutrition standards", "answers": ["The term child nutrition programs refers to several U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service (USDA-FNS) programs that provide food for children in institutional settings. These include the school meals programs—the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program—as well as the Child and Adult Care Food Program, Summer Food Service Program, Special Milk Program, and Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program. The most recent child nutrition reauthorization, the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA; P.L. 111-296), made a number of changes to the child nutrition programs. In some cases, these changes spurred debate during the law's implementation, particularly in regard to updated nutrition standards for school meals and snacks. On September 30, 2015, some of the authorities created by the HHFKA expired. Efforts to reauthorize the child nutrition programs in the 114th Congress, while not completed, considered several related issues and prompted further discussion about the programs. There were no substantial reauthorization attempts in the 115th Congress. Current issues discussed in this report include the following: Nutrition standards for school meals and snacks. The HHFKA required USDA to update the nutrition standards for school meals and other foods sold in schools. USDA issued final rules on these standards in 2012 and 2016, respectively. Some schools had difficulty implementing the nutrition standards, and USDA and Congress have taken actions to change certain parts of the standards related to whole grains, sodium, and milk. Offerings in the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP). There have been debates recently over whether the FFVP should include processed and preserved fruits and vegetables, including canned, dried, and frozen items. Currently, statute permits only fresh offerings. \"Buy American\" requirements for school meals. The school meals programs' authorizing laws require schools to source foods domestically, with some exceptions, under Buy American requirements. Efforts both to tighten and loosen these requirements have been made in recent years. The enacted 2018 farm bill (P.L. 115-334) instructed USDA to \"enforce full compliance\" with the Buy American requirements and report to Congress within 180 days of enactment. Congregate feeding in summer meals. Under current law, children must consume summer meals on-site. This is known as the \"congregate feeding\" requirement. Starting in 2010, Congress funded demonstration projects, including the Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) demonstration, to test alternatives to congregate feeding in summer meals. Congress has increased funding for Summer EBT in recent appropriations cycles and there have been discussions about whether to continue or expand the program. Implementation of the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP). The HHFKA created CEP, an option for qualifying schools, groups of schools, and school districts to offer free meals to all students. Because income-based applications for school meals are no longer required in schools adopting CEP, its implementation has created data issues for federal and state programs relying on free and reduced-price lunch eligibility data. Unpaid meal costs and \"lunch shaming.\" The issue of students not paying for meals and schools' handling of these situations has received increasing attention. Some schools have adopted what some term as \"lunch shaming\" practices, including throwing away a student's selected hot meal and providing a cold meal alternative when a student does not pay. Congress and USDA have taken actions recently to reduce instances of student nonpayment and stigmatization. Paid lunch pricing. One result of new requirements in the HHFKA was price increases for paid (full price) lunches in many schools. Attempts have been made—some successfully—to loosen these \"paid lunch equity\" requirements in recent years."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5157}
{"pred": " The Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund (CSPF) is a multiemployer pension plan that has faced significant financial challenges, leading to a critical and declining status. Established in 1955 to provide benefits to trucking industry workers, CSPF has experienced a decline in active participants and an increase in retirees, resulting in a shrinking contribution base and growing unfunded liabilities. Despite initial efforts to stabilize the plan, CSPF's funded percentage has remained below 40% since the 1980s, with a 2017 funded ratio of 38% of its accrued liability. The plan's financial difficulties are attributed to a combination of factors, including industry deregulation, declining union membership, employer withdrawals, and market downturns that impacted investment returns. The 2008 financial crisis exacerbated these issues, leading to significant losses in plan assets. CSPF's investment strategy, which historically favored equities, has not been sufficient to offset these losses, and the plan has had to rely on investment returns to meet funding targets. The plan's financial condition has been further strained by the withdrawal of major employers like UPS, which left a substantial unfunded liability. In response to these challenges, CSPF has sought to reduce benefits under the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014, but its application was denied. The plan is now moving toward a more conservative investment strategy to avoid insolvency, with a projected insolvency date of 2025. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) insures multiemployer plans, but its financial reserves are also under strain, with a projected insolvency within eight years. The report highlights the broader challenges facing multiemployer pension plans, including underfunding, investment risks, and the impact of industry-specific trends. It underscores the need for improved funding mechanisms, regulatory oversight, and potential reforms to ensure the long-term sustainability of these plans.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report about the Central States Pension Fund (CSPF). Let me start by understanding the key points from the report. \n\nFirst, CSPF is a multiemployer pension plan, which means it's funded by multiple employers and unions. It was established in 1955 for trucking industry workers. The report mentions that multiemployer plans are common in industries with many small employers, like trucking. However, CSPF has been in financial trouble for a long time. \n\nThe main issues are underfunding and financial", "answers": ["Multiemployer plans are collectively bargained pension agreements often between labor unions and two or more employers. CSPF is one of the nation's largest multiemployer defined benefit pension plans, covering about 385,000 participants. Since 1982, the plan has operated under a court-enforceable consent decree which, among other things, requires that the plan's assets be managed by independent parties. Within 7 years, CSPF estimates that the plan's financial condition will require severe benefit cuts. GAO was asked to review the events and factors that led to the plan's critical financial status and how its investment outcomes compare to similar plans. GAO describes (1) what is known about the factors that contributed to CSPF's critical financial condition; (2) what has been CSPF's investment policy, and the process for setting and executing it, since the consent decree was established; and (3) how CSPF's investments have performed over time, particularly compared to similar pension plans. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations; interviewed CSPF representatives, International Brotherhood of Teamsters officials and members, federal officials, and knowledgeable industry stakeholders; reviewed CSPF documentation including investment policy statements and board of trustee meeting minutes; and analyzed investment returns and fees from required, annual pension plan filings and from consultant benchmarking reports. The Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund (CSPF) was established in 1955 to provide pension benefits to trucking industry workers, and is one of the largest multiemployer plans. According to its regulatory filings, CSPF had less than half the estimated funds needed to cover plan liabilities in 1982 at the time it entered into a court-enforceable consent decree that provides for oversight of certain plan activities. Since then, CSPF has made some progress toward achieving its targeted level of funding; however, CSPF has never been more than 75 percent funded and its funding level has weakened since 2002, as shown in the figure below. Stakeholders GAO interviewed identified numerous factors that contributed to CSPF's financial condition. For example, stakeholders stated that changes within the trucking industry as well as a decline in union membership contributed to CSPF's inability to maintain a healthy contribution base. CSPF's active participants made up about 69 percent of all participants in 1982, but accounted for only 16 percent in 2016. The most dramatic change in active participants occurred in 2007 when the United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) withdrew from the plan. At that time, UPS accounted for about 30 percent of the plan's active participants (i.e. workers). In addition, the market declines of 2001 to 2002 and 2008 had a significant negative impact on the plan's long-term investment performance. Stakeholders noted that while each individual factor contributed to CSPF's critical financial condition, the interrelated nature of the factors also had a cumulative effect on the plan's financial condition. Both CSPF's investment policy and the process for setting and executing it have changed several times since the consent decree was established in 1982. The original consent decree gave an independent asset manager—called a named fiduciary—exclusive authority to set and change the plan's investment policies and manage plan assets, and prohibited CSPF trustees from managing assets or making investment decisions. Initially, the named fiduciaries sold the troubled real estate assets acquired during the pre-consent decree era. Subsequent changes include the following: In 1993, the named fiduciaries started to increase investment in equities, and their policies continued to direct that asset allocations be weighted toward equities until early 2017. Between 2003 and 2010, the court approved three plan decisions to move a total of 50 percent of CSPF's assets into passively-managed accounts (passive management typically seeks to match the performance of a specific market index and reduce investment fees). An early-2017 investment policy change precipitated by CSPF's deteriorating financial condition will continue to move plan assets into fixed income investments ahead of projected insolvency, or the date when CSPF is expected to have insufficient assets to pay promised benefits when due. As a result, assets will be gradually transitioned from “return-seeking assets”—such as equities and emerging markets debt—to high-quality investment grade debt and U.S. Treasury securities with intermediate and short-term maturities. The plan is projected to become insolvent on January 1, 2025. CSPF officials and named fiduciary representatives said these changes are intended to reduce the plan's exposure to market risk and volatility, and provide participants greater certainty prior to projected insolvency. GAO found that CSPF's investment returns and expenses were generally in line with similarly sized institutional investors and with demographically similar multiemployer pension plans. For example, GAO's analysis of returns using the peer group measure used by CSPF known as the Wilshire Associates' Trust Universe Comparison Service (TUCS), showed that CSPF's annual investment returns since 1995 were above the median about as many times as they were below. Similarly, comparing CSPF's returns to a peer group of similar multiemployer defined benefit plans using federally required annual reports found that CSPF's annual investment returns were in line with those of its peers. Specifically, CSPF's annual returns were above the median nine times and below it six times—and CSPF's overall (dollar-weighted) average annual return from 2000 through 2014 was close to that of the peer median average return of 4.8 percent. In addition, GAO found that CSPF's investment fees and other administrative expenses have also been in line with other large multiemployer plans. For example: CSPF's investment fees as a percentage of assets were about 9 percent lower than the median of large defined benefit multiemployer plans over the 2000 through 2014 period—though much of that difference is accounted for by a relative reduction in investment fees since 2007. CSPF's investment fees as a percentage of assets were, on average, about 34 basis points (or 0.34 percent). CSPF's administrative expenses related to the day-to-day operations of the plan have also been in line with other large multiemployer plans. CSPF's administrative expenses per participant were below the median for large defined benefit multiemployer plans for 12 of the 15 years over the 2000 through 2014 period. As of 2014, CSPF's administrative expense was $98 per participant, which is about 16 percent less than the median for large defined benefit multiemployer plans.

{"pred": " The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 established the Choice Program, which allowed veterans to receive care from community providers when VA facilities could not provide timely access. The program was funded with $10 billion and had a sunset date of June 2019. Additional funding was provided in 2017 and 2018, totaling $9.4 billion. The program was administered by two TPAs, Health Net and TriWest, which managed provider networks, scheduled appointments, and processed claims. However, the program faced challenges, including delays in claim payments to providers, which were attributed to VA's untimely payments to TPAs, strict reimbursement requirements, and inadequate provider education. VA made improvements, such as transitioning to a new payment system and modifying some requirements, but issues with authorization approvals and customer service for providers remained. The VA MISSION Act of 2018 aims to consolidate community care programs and improve payment timeliness. VA is also developing a new program, Veterans Community Care, with enhanced monitoring and customer service requirements. Despite these efforts, challenges persist, and the report recommends that VA monitor SAR approval times and ensure compliance with customer service requirements for providers.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report about the Veterans Choice Program. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report discusses the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014, which created the Choice Program to help veterans get care from community providers when VA facilities couldn't. It was funded with $10 billion and had a sunset date in 2019. Additional funding was added in 2017 and 2018. The program was managed by two TPAs, Health Net and TriWest, which handled provider networks, scheduling, and claims processing. \n\nBut there were issues. The report mentions delays in payments to providers, which were due to VA's slow payments to TPAs, strict requirements for reimbursement, and lack of provider education. VA made some improvements, like switching to a new payment system and modifying some rules, but problems with authorizations and customer service for providers remained. The VA MISSION Act of 2018 aims to consolidate programs and improve payment timeliness. They're also developing a new program, Veterans Community Care, with better monitoring and customer service. \n\nThe report also points out that VA isn't collecting data on some requirements, like SAR", "answers": ["Questions have been raised about the lack of timeliness of TPAs' payments to community providers under the Choice Program and how this may affect the willingness of providers to participate in the program as well as in the forthcoming Veterans Community Care Program. You asked GAO to review issues related to the timeliness of TPAs' payments to community providers under the Choice Program. This report examines, among other things, (1) the length of time TPAs have taken to pay community providers' claims and factors affecting timeliness of payments, and (2) actions taken by VA and the TPAs to reduce the length of time TPAs take to pay community providers for Choice Program claims. GAO reviewed TPA data on the length of time taken to pay community provider claims from November 2014 through June 2018, the most recent data available at the time of GAO's review. GAO also reviewed documentation, such as the contracts between VA and its TPAs, and interviewed VA and TPA officials. In addition, GAO interviewed a non-generalizable sample of 15 community providers, selected based on their large Choice Program claims volume, to learn about their experiences with payment timeliness. The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Choice Program (Choice Program) was created in 2014 to address problems with veterans' timely access to care at VA medical facilities. The Choice Program allows eligible veterans to obtain health care services from providers not directly employed by VA (community providers), who are then reimbursed for their services through one of the program's two third-party administrators (TPA). GAO's analysis of TPA data available for November 2014 through June 2018 shows that the length of time the TPAs took to pay community providers' clean claims each month varied widely—from 7 days to 68 days. VA and its TPAs identified several key factors affecting timeliness of payments to community providers under the Choice Program, including VA's untimely payments to TPAs, which in turn extended the length of time TPAs took to pay community providers' claims; and inadequate provider education on filing claims. VA has taken actions to address key factors that have contributed to the length of time TPAs have taken to pay community providers. For example, VA updated its payment system and related processes to pay TPAs more quickly. According to VA data, as of July 2018, VA was paying at least 90 percent of the TPAs' invoices within 7 days. In addition, VA and the TPAs have taken steps to improve provider education to help providers resolve claims processing issues. However, 9 of the 15 providers GAO interviewed said they continue to experience lengthy telephone hold times. According to VA and TPA officials, steps have been taken to improve the customer service offered to community providers. However, VA officials do not collect data on or monitor TPA compliance with customer service requirements—such as calls being answered within 30 seconds or less—for provider calls because they said they are not enforcing the requirements and are allowing TPAs to prioritize calls from veterans. Without collecting data and monitoring compliance, VA does not have information on challenges providers may face when contacting TPAs to resolve payment issues. GAO is making two recommendations, including that VA should collect data on and monitor compliance with its requirements pertaining to customer service for community providers. VA concurred with GAO's recommendations and described steps it will take to implement them."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5443}

The agency receives funding from federal, state, and local sources, with federal grants accounting for over half of its capital investments from 2011 to 2017. Despite significant capital expenditures, WMATA has faced challenges in fully utilizing its budgets due to issues like contract delays, changing priorities, and federal reimbursement restrictions. The report emphasizes the need for a more structured and transparent capital planning process to better align with strategic goals and improve decision-making. \n\nWMATA has initiated a new capital planning process aimed at developing a data-driven approach to prioritize capital projects and improve asset management. However, the agency has not yet established documented policies and procedures for this process, which could hinder consistent and effective investment decisions.

WMATA initiated a new preventive maintenance program for its rail track in 2017, and is currently implementing a new capital planning process. GAO was asked to examine issues related to WMATA's capital funding and maintenance practices. This report examines: (1) how WMATA spent its capital funds from fiscal years 2011 through 2017, (2) how WMATA's new capital planning process addresses weaknesses it identified in the prior process, and (3) WMATA's progress toward its track preventive maintenance program's goals and how the program aligns with leading program management practices. GAO analyzed WMATA's financial and program information, interviewed officials of WMATA, the Federal Transit Administration, and five transit agencies selected for similarities to WMATA. GAO compared WMATA's capital planning process and track maintenance program with leading practices. From fiscal years 2011 through 2017, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) spent almost $6 billion on a variety of capital assets, with the largest share spent on improving its rail and bus fleet (see figure). Over this period, WMATA's capital spending was, on average, about $845 million annually. WMATA's new capital planning process could address some weaknesses it identified in the prior process. WMATA established a framework for quantitatively prioritizing capital needs (investments to a group of related assets) over a 10-year period. However, WMATA has not established documented policies and procedures for implementing the new process, such as those for selecting specific projects for funding in its annual capital budget. WMATA is currently using its new capital planning process to make fiscal year 2020 investment decisions. WMATA has proposed a fiscal year 2020 capital budget of $1.4 billion. Without documented policies and procedures for implementing the new planning process, WMATA's stakeholders do not have reasonable assurance that WMATA is following a sound process for making investment decisions. WMATA has made significant progress toward its track preventive maintenance program's goals, which are to reduce both track-defect and electrical-fire incidents by 50 percent in fiscal year 2019 compared with 2017. In fiscal year 2018, WMATA met its goal for reducing track defect incidents and reduced electrical fire incidents by 20 percent. However, in designing the program, WMATA did not fully assess risks. For example, WMATA did not quantitatively assess the impact of track defects or electrical fires on its ability to provide service, nor did it consider other risks such as non-electrical track fires, which represent about 30 percent of all fires on the system, or other factors, such as resources or track time. Without a comprehensive risk assessment, WMATA lacks reasonable assurance that the program is designed to address risks affecting the safety of the rail system or other risks that could hinder the new program's success. GAO is making five recommendations, including that WMATA establish documented policies and procedures for the new capital planning process and conduct a comprehensive risk assessment for the track preventive maintenance program.

{"pred": " The World Trade Organization (WTO) is an international organization that administers trade rules and agreements among its 164 members, aiming to eliminate trade barriers and promote a rules-based trading system. Established in 1995, the WTO succeeded the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which was created in 1947 to foster postwar economic cooperation. The United States played a pivotal role in the establishment of the WTO and has been a key leader in shaping its rules and agreements. The WTO's core principles include nondiscrimination, transparency, and the gradual reduction of trade barriers, with the goal of fostering international economic stability and prosperity. \n\nThe WTO's functions include administering trade rules, facilitating negotiations, and resolving trade disputes through its Dispute Settlement Mechanism (DSM). However, the organization has faced challenges in recent years, including the inability to reach consensus on new multilateral agreements, such as the Doha Round, and the growing use of protectionist policies by some countries. The WTO's effectiveness has been questioned, particularly regarding its dispute settlement system, which has been criticized for procedural delays and perceived judicial overreach. The Appellate Body (AB), which reviews dispute panel decisions, has been a focal point of controversy, with the United States withholding approval for new appointments, leading to concerns about its functionality.\n\nThe Trump Administration has expressed skepticism toward the WTO, questioning its value to the U.S. economy and advocating for bilateral trade agreements instead of multilateral negotiations. This has raised concerns about the future of U.S. leadership in the WTO and the potential impact of U.S. withdrawal. The WTO's ability to address modern trade issues, such as digital trade, state-owned enterprises, and intellectual property rights, has also been challenged, as its rules have not kept pace with the rapid changes in global commerce.\n\nDespite these challenges, the WTO remains a critical institution for global trade, with the majority of world trade occurring among its members. The organization's future depends on its ability to reform and adapt to new economic realities, including the need for updated rules and a more efficient dispute settlement system.

The ongoing debates and negotiations within the WTO reflect the complex and evolving nature of international trade and the need for a balanced, rules-based system to support global economic cooperation.\nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) is an international organization that administers trade rules and agreements among", "answers": ["Historically, the United States' leadership of the global trading system has ensured the United States a seat at the table to shape the international trade agenda in ways that both advance and defend U.S. interests. The evolution of U.S. leadership and the global trade agenda remain of interest to Congress, which holds constitutional authority over foreign commerce and establishes trade negotiating objectives and principles through legislation. Congress has recognized the World Trade Organization (WTO) as the \"foundation of the global trading system\" within trade promotion authority (TPA) and plays a direct legislative and oversight role over WTO agreements. The statutory basis for U.S. WTO membership is the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (P.L. 103-465), and U.S. priorities and objectives for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)/WTO have been reflected in various TPA legislation since 1974. Congress also has oversight of the U.S. Trade Representative and other agencies that participate in WTO meetings and enforce WTO commitments. The WTO is a 164-member international organization that was created to oversee and administer multilateral trade rules, serve as a forum for trade liberalization negotiations, and resolve trade disputes. The United States was a major force behind the establishment of the WTO in 1995, and the rules and agreements resulting from multilateral trade negotiations. The WTO encompassed and succeeded the GATT, established in 1947 among the United States and 22 other countries. Through the GATT and WTO, the United States, with other countries, sought to establish a more open, rules-based trading system in the postwar era, with the goal of fostering international economic cooperation and raising economic prosperity worldwide. Today, 98% of global trade is among WTO members. The WTO is a consensus and member-driven organization. Its core principles include nondiscrimination (most favored nation treatment and national treatment), freer trade, fair competition, transparency, and encouraging development. These are enshrined in a series of WTO trade agreements covering goods, agriculture, services, intellectual property rights, and trade facilitation, among other issues. Some countries, including China, have been motivated to join the WTO not just to expand access to foreign markets but to spur domestic economic reforms, help transition to market economies, and promote the rule of law. The WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) provides an enforceable means for members to resolve disputes over WTO commitments and obligations. The WTO has processed more than 500 disputes, and the United States has been an active user of the dispute settlement system. Supporters of the multilateral trading system consider the dispute settlement mechanism an important success of the system. At the same time, some members, including the United States, contend it has procedural shortcomings and has exceeded its mandate in deciding cases. Many observers are concerned that the effectiveness of the WTO has diminished since the collapse of the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations, which began in 2001, and believe the WTO needs to adopt reforms to continue its role as the foundation of the global trading system. To date, WTO members have been unable to reach consensus for a new comprehensive multilateral agreement on trade liberalization and rules. While global supply chains and technology have transformed international trade and investment, global trade rules have not kept up with the pace of change. Many countries have turned to negotiating free trade agreements (FTAs) outside the WTO as well as plurilateral agreements involving subsets of WTO members rather than all members. At the latest WTO Ministerial conference in December 2017, no major deliverables were announced. Several members committed to make progress on ongoing talks, such as fisheries subsidies and e-commerce, while other areas remain stalled. While many were disappointed by the limited progress, in the U.S. view, the outcome signaled that \"the impasse at the WTO was broken,\" paving the way for groups of like-minded countries to pursue new work in other key areas. Certain WTO members have begun to explore aspects of reform and future negotiations. Potential reforms concern the administration of the organization, its procedures and practices, and attempts to address the inability of WTO members to conclude new agreements. Proposed DS reforms also attempt to improve the working of the dispute settlement system, particularly the Appellate Body—the seven-member body that reviews appeals by WTO members of a panel's findings in a dispute case. Some U.S. frustrations with the WTO are not new and many are shared by other trading partners, such as the European Union. At the same time, the Administration's overall approach has spurred new questions regarding the future of U.S. leadership and U.S. priorities for improving the multilateral trading system. Concerns have emphasized that the Administration's recent actions to unilaterally raise tariffs under U.S. trade laws and to possibly impede the functioning of the dispute settlement system might undermine the credibility of the WTO system. A growing question of some observers is whether the WTO would flounder for lack of U.S. leadership, or whether other WTO members like the EU and China taking on larger roles would continue to make it a meaningful actor in the global trade environment. The growing debate over the role and future direction of the WTO may be of interest to Congress. Important issues it may address include how current and future WTO agreements affect the U.S. economy, the value of U.S. membership and leadership in the WTO, whether new U.S. negotiating objectives or oversight hearings are needed to address prospects for new WTO reforms and rulemaking, and the relevant authorities and impact of potential U.S. withdrawal from the WTO on U.S. economic and foreign policy interests."], "all_classes": null, "length": 21561}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report to understand the main points. The report is about improper payments in federal programs and how agencies are required to address them under IPIA, IPERA, and IPERIA. \n\nFirst, the report outlines the steps agencies must take: risk assessment, developing estimates, analyzing root causes, and reporting. Then it talks about the six agencies reviewed and their methods for estimating improper payments. Some use statistical sampling, others alternative methods. For example, the Department of Education used an alternative method for Direct Loans after a cost-benefit analysis. The Department of Health and Human Services used it for Medicaid to manage resources. \n\nThere's mention of OMB guidance, which allows flexibility in methods but requires including all improper payments, even if recovered. The report points out that some agencies, like DOD and OPM, have limitations in their processes. DOD's Military Pay doesn't check eligibility for special pay, and OPM's Retirement program doesn't test older claims. These gaps could affect the accuracy of their estimates. \n\nThe report also discusses how agencies handle insufficient documentation and nonresponse cases. HHS considers nonresponse cases as improper, while others like IRS don't. There's a recommendation for OMB to provide clearer guidance on testing methods and handling nonresponse. Also, IRS is excluding recovered overpayments from their EITC estimates, which understates the problem. \n\nThe recommendations include OMB developing guidance on risk-based testing and nonresponse treatment, and specific actions for DOD, OPM, and IRS. The report concludes that current processes vary and may not fully address risks, leading to potential underestimation of improper payments. \n\nNow, I need to condense this into a one-page summary. Start with the purpose of the report, the requirements under the laws, the agencies reviewed, their methods, the issues found (like DOD and OPM's processes), the handling of documentation and nonresponse, the recommendations, and the conclusion.

Executive branch agencies are required to annually estimate improper payments for certain programs. Estimation of improper payments is key to understanding the extent of the problem and to developing effective corrective actions. Relevant laws and guidance provide agencies flexibility in developing estimates. This report describes agencies' processes to estimate improper payments in selected programs for fiscal year 2017 and the extent to which certain differences in these processes can affect the usefulness of the resulting estimates. GAO selected 10 programs across six agencies with the largest reported program outlays in fiscal years 2015 and 2016. For these programs, GAO reviewed relevant laws and guidance, analyzed agencies' policies and procedures, and interviewed officials at relevant agencies and OMB staff. The six agencies GAO reviewed reported taking various approaches related to key components of estimating improper payments—shown in the figure below—for 10 selected programs, which collectively reported outlays of over $2.5 trillion for fiscal year 2017. Sample selection. Eight of the 10 programs GAO reviewed reported using statistically valid approaches, and the remaining 2 reported using alternative methodologies approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The sampled data elements varied, including payments, medical claims, and tax returns. The age of the data used to develop fiscal year 2017 improper payment estimates also varied, ranging from calendar year 2013 to fiscal year 2017. Identification of improper payments. Some of the six agencies reported using processes designed specifically to estimate improper payments, whereas others reported leveraging existing reviews. These agencies' policies and procedures include a review of aspects of eligibility, except for those related to the Department of Defense's (DOD) Military Pay and the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Retirement overpayments. DOD and OPM have not fully assessed whether their estimation processes effectively consider key program risks. OMB guidance does not specifically address how agencies are to test to identify improper payments, such as using a risk-based approach to help ensure that key risks of improper payments are addressed. The six agencies also varied in the treatment of insufficient documentation, both in identifying and in reporting the root causes of improper payments. For the agencies that contact entities outside the agency to estimate improper payments, the treatment of nonresponse differed, with one agency including nonresponses as improper payments and another generally excluding the nonresponse cases from review. Although OMB guidance states that agencies should treat cases of insufficient documentation as improper payments, it does not specifically address the treatment of nonresponse cases. Calculation of the improper payment estimate. The six agencies generally reported using law and OMB guidance to calculate improper payment estimates for the selected programs, except for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) removed overpayments that were recovered when developing its estimate. OMB guidance requires agencies to include recovered amounts in their estimates. Removing these overpayments understates the EITC improper payment estimate and may limit IRS's ability to develop corrective actions to prevent improper payments. GAO recommends that OMB develop guidance on treatment of nonresponse cases and testing to identify improper payments, that DOD and OPM assess their estimation processes, and that IRS revise its methodology to not exclude recovered payments from its estimate. All of the agencies either agreed or partially agreed with the specific recommendations to them.

Key findings include:\n\n1. **TAP Structure and Staffing**: The Coast Guard's TAP is managed by 13 installations, with one or two managers per district overseeing operations across regions. The program manager in Headquarters manages TAP for the Coast Guard, which is under DHS, not DOD.\n\n2. **Data Reliability Issues**: The Coast Guard lacks an updated Commandant Instruction, leading to inconsistent and unreliable TAP participation data. Data are recorded ad-hoc in shared spreadsheets, and a new system (DOD's TAP-IT Enterprise System) is expected to improve data collection by May 2018.\n\n3. **Participation Challenges**: Remote locations, rapid separations, and lack of awareness are major barriers to TAP participation. Commanders sometimes hinder participation by requiring servicemembers to return to duty or delay classes due to mission priorities.\n\n4. **Online TAP Utilization**: Online delivery is critical for remote and rapidly separating servicemembers, but it lacks the interactivity of classroom settings. TAP managers note that online participants often struggle to engage with the material.\n\n5. **Performance Monitoring Gaps**: The Coast Guard does not track timeliness of participation or access to additional 2-day classes. Without formal performance goals or clear roles for commanders, monitoring and accountability are lacking.\n\n6. **Interagency Collaboration**: The Coast Guard is part of an interagency TAP governance structure, but data sharing with DOD and other agencies is limited, hindering comprehensive program evaluation.\n\n7. **Recommendations**: The report recommends updating the Commandant Instruction, establishing performance goals, monitoring participation timelines, improving data sharing, and clarifying commander roles to enhance TAP implementation and compliance with federal requirements.\n\nThe Coast Guard's efforts to improve TAP data reliability and implementation are ongoing, with a focus on aligning with DOD's systems and practices to better support servicemembers' transitions to civilian life.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report.

To help them prepare, federal law mandated that DHS provide separating Coast Guard servicemembers with counseling, employment assistance, and information on veterans' benefits through TAP. GAO was asked to examine TAP implementation. This review analyzes (1) the reliability of TAP data on participation levels for Coast Guard servicemembers and the factors that affect participation, and (2) the Coast Guard's performance measures and monitoring efforts related to TAP. GAO interviewed Coast Guard headquarters staff; surveyed 12 Coast Guard installations that conduct TAP (100 percent response rate); collected and reviewed participation data for reliability; and interviewed TAP managers from three installations selected for size and location, and 25 Coast Guard servicemembers at one location. (For a companion report on TAP implementation for separating and retiring servicemembers in other military services, see GAO-18-23 .) The United States Coast Guard (Coast Guard), which is overseen by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), lacks complete or reliable data on participation in the Transition Assistance Program (TAP), designed to assist servicemembers returning to civilian life. According to senior Coast Guard officials, a major reason why data are not reliable is the lack of an up-to-date Commandant Instruction that specifies when to record TAP participation data. Consequently, the data are updated on an ad-hoc basis and may not be timely or complete, according to officials. Federal internal control standards call for management to use quality information to achieve the entity's objectives. Until the Coast Guard issues an up-to-date Commandant Instruction that establishes policies and procedures to improve the reliability and completeness of TAP data, it will lack quality information to gauge the extent to which it is meeting TAP participation requirements in the VOW to Hire Heroes Act of 2011. According to GAO's survey of Coast Guard installations, various factors affected participation, such as servicemembers serving at geographically remote locations or separating from the Coast Guard rapidly. TAP officials and Coast Guard servicemembers GAO interviewed said commanders and direct supervisors sometimes pulled servicemembers out of TAP class or postponed participation because of mission priorities. TAP managers also said they rely on delivering TAP online because many Coast Guard servicemembers are stationed remotely. The Coast Guard cannot effectively measure performance to ensure key TAP requirements are met because it lacks reliable data and does not monitor compliance with several TAP requirements. Further, the Coast Guard has not established a formal performance goal against which it can measure progress, although federal internal control standards stipulate that management should consider external requirements—such as the laws with which the entity is required to comply—to clearly define objectives in specific and measurable terms. Establishing a goal could help the Coast Guard define expected performance. In addition, the Coast Guard does not monitor TAP requirements regarding the timeliness of servicemembers' TAP participation or their access to additional 2-day classes. Consequently, it cannot know whether servicemembers are starting TAP early enough to complete the program or those who elected to attend additional 2-day classes were able to do so before separation or retirement, as required by the Act. Finally, the Coast Guard lacks an up-to-date Commandant Instruction that establishes the roles and responsibilities of Coast Guard staff in implementing TAP. Federal internal control standards stipulate that management should assign responsibility and delegate authority to key roles throughout the entity. Issuing an up-to-date Commandant Instruction that defines roles and responsibilities would clarify who is ultimately responsible for ensuring Coast Guard servicemembers attend TAP, thereby facilitating accountability.

The summary needs to be concise, so I'll start with an introduction about the report's purpose. Then, the main sections: radiation effects, the linear no-threshold model, federal agencies' approaches, research funding, and the call for interagency collaboration.\n\nWait, the report also talks about the differences between high and low-dose radiation effects. High doses cause acute symptoms, while low doses are harder to detect. The National Academies' 2006 report is mentioned, which supports the linear model. Agencies like NRC, EPA, etc., use this model despite uncertainties, especially with data from Japanese survivors versus chronic exposure in the US.\n\nThen there's the part about funding. From 2012-2016, agencies spent $209.6 million, but there was no collaborative mechanism. DOE and NIH were the main funders, and funding decreased over the years. The report also mentions the Million Person Study and the need for better research to reduce uncertainty.\n\nThe recommendation part is important too. GAO suggested DOE lead an interagency collaboration, but DOE disagreed, thinking other agencies have their own mandates.

The Department of Energy (DOE), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Food and Drug Administration generally used the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public in the radiation exposure settings that GAO reviewed. These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas. GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research . Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.

{"pred": " The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) of 1977 was enacted to ensure that federally insured banks meet the credit needs of the communities in which they operate, particularly low- and moderate-income (LMI) areas. The CRA requires federal regulators to evaluate banks' lending, investment, and service activities within designated assessment areas, assigning performance ratings (Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve, Substantial Noncompliance) that influence decisions on bank charters, mergers, and other regulatory actions. While the CRA aims to promote equitable access to financial services, its effectiveness has been debated. Critics argue that the CRA may incentivize banks to focus on LMI areas at the expense of more profitable opportunities, potentially leading to higher-risk lending. Others contend that enforcement has been too lenient, resulting in insufficient financial services in underserved communities. The CRA applies to banks but not credit unions or other nonbank institutions, and it is administered by the OCC, Federal Reserve, and FDIC. Recent discussions focus on modernizing the CRA to address challenges posed by technological advancements and evolving financial markets, including revising assessment area definitions, clarifying qualifying activities, and improving the efficiency of the examination process. Despite these debates, the CRA remains a key tool in promoting financial inclusion and community development.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this detailed report on the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Let me start by understanding the main points of the report. \n\nFirst, the CRA was passed in 1977 to address concerns that banks weren't meeting local credit needs, especially in low- and moderate-income areas. It requires federal regulators to assess banks' activities and assign ratings that affect their regulatory actions. The report explains how the CRA works, including the three tests (lending, investment, service) and the performance ratings. \n\nThen there are debates about its effectiveness. Some say it might push banks to focus on LMI areas, leading to higher-risk loans, while others think enforcement isn't strict enough. The report also mentions that most banks get Satisfactory or better ratings, which some see as weak enforcement. \n\nThe CRA applies to certain banks but not credit unions or other institutions. It's administered by three agencies. The report discusses recent modernization efforts, like revising assessment areas and clarifying qualifying activities. There's also mention of challenges like technological changes affecting how banks operate and the difficulty in linking lending decisions directly to CRA incentives.\n\nI need to condense all this into a concise one-page", "answers": ["The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA; P.L. 95-128, 12 U.S.C. §§2901-2908) addresses how banking institutions meet the credit needs of the areas they serve, particularly in low- and moderate-income (LMI) neighborhoods. The federal banking regulatory agencies—the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)—currently implement the CRA. The regulators issue CRA credits, or points, where banks engage in qualifying activities—such as mortgage, consumer, and business lending; community investments; and low-cost services that would benefit LMI areas and entities—that occur with a designated assessment area. These credits are then used to issue each bank a performance rating. The CRA requires these ratings be taken into account when banks apply for charters, branches, mergers, and acquisitions among other things. The CRA, which was enacted in 1977, was subsequently revised in 1989 to require public disclosure of bank CRA ratings to establish a four-tiered system of descriptive performance levels (i.e., Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve, or Substantial Noncompliance). In 1995, the CRA examination was customized to account for differences in bank sizes and business models. In 2005, the bank size definitions were revised and indexed to the Consumer Price Index. The 2005 amendments also expanded opportunities for banks to earn CRA credit for public welfare investments (such as providing housing, services, or jobs that primarily benefit LMI individuals). Qualifying activities under the CRA have evolved to include consumer and business lending, community investments, and low-cost services that would benefit LMI areas and entities. Congressional interest in the CRA stems from various perceptions of its effectiveness. Some have argued that, by encouraging lending in LMI neighborhoods, the CRA may also encourage the issuance of higher-risk loans to borrowers likely to have repayment problems (under the presumption that low-income is correlated with lower creditworthiness), which can translate into losses for lenders. Others are concerned that the CRA is not generating sufficient incentives to increase credit availability to qualified LMI borrowers, which may impede economic recovery for some, particularly following the 2007-2009 recession. This report informs the congressional debate concerning the CRA's effectiveness in incentivizing bank lending and investment activity to LMI borrowers. After a discussion of the CRA's origins, it presents the CRA's examination process and bank activities that are eligible for consideration of CRA credits. Next, it discusses the difficulty of determining the CRA's influence on bank behavior. For example, the CRA does not specify the quality and quantity of CRA-qualifying activities, meaning that compliance with the CRA does not require adherence to lending quotas or benchmarks. In the absence of benchmarks, determining the extent to which CRA incentives have influenced LMI credit availability relative to other factors is not straightforward. Banks also face a variety of financial incentives—for example, capital requirements, the prevailing interest rate environment, changes in tax laws, and technological innovations—that influence how much (or how little) they lend to LMI borrowers. Because multiple financial profit incentives and CRA incentives tend to exist simultaneously, it is difficult to determine the extent to which CRA incentives have influenced LMI credit availability relative to other factors."], "all_classes": null, "length": 7111}

The VA is divided into three major administrations: the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), and National Cemetery Administration (NCA). The report highlights the challenges VA faces in managing employee misconduct and disciplinary actions, particularly due to fragmented information systems and inconsistent data collection practices. VA has 12 separate systems for tracking misconduct and disciplinary actions, but none provide complete or interoperable data, limiting the agency’s ability to analyze misconduct department-wide. The report identifies issues such as missing data fields, lack of standardization, and the absence of unique identifiers, which hinder the reliability and usefulness of the data. Additionally, the report finds that VA’s processes for documenting and retaining disciplinary action files are inconsistent, with some files missing key documentation required by policy. The Office of Inspector General (OIG) and other oversight bodies are responsible for investigating allegations of misconduct, but the report notes that responses to these investigations often lack the required elements, and there is a risk of conflicts of interest when investigations are conducted by the same facility or program office where the misconduct occurred. The report also highlights concerns about retaliation against whistleblowers, as nonanonymous whistleblowers faced higher rates of adverse action and attrition compared to the general VA population. The report concludes with 16 recommendations to improve data collection, documentation, and oversight processes to ensure accountability and transparency in handling misconduct cases within the VA.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report about the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Let me start by understanding the main points. The report is about VA's structure, its various administrations, and the challenges they face with employee misconduct and disciplinary actions. \n\nFirst, the VA has three main administrations: VHA, VBA, and NCA. The VHA is the largest with around 316,800 employees. The report mentions that VA has a budget of $186.4 billion for fiscal year 2018. Then there are several offices involved in addressing misconduct, like OHRM, OAR, OIG, OAWP, etc. \n\nThe key issue the report focuses on is the management of employee misconduct. VA uses 12 different information systems to track misconduct and disciplinary actions, but these systems are fragmented. They don't share data, leading to incomplete", "answers": ["VA provides services and benefits to veterans through hospitals and other facilities nationwide. Misconduct by VA employees can have serious consequences for some veterans, including poor quality of care. GAO was asked to review employee misconduct across VA. This report reviews the extent to which VA (1) collects reliable information associated with employee misconduct and disciplinary actions, (2) adheres to documentation-retention procedures when adjudicating cases of employee misconduct, (3) ensures allegations of misconduct involving senior officials are reviewed according to VA investigative standards and these officials are held accountable, and (4) has procedures to investigate whistle-blower allegations of misconduct; and the extent to which (5) data and whistle-blower testimony indicate whether retaliation for disclosing misconduct occurs at VA. GAO analyzed 12 information systems across VA to assess the reliability of misconduct data, examined a stratified random sample of 544 misconduct cases from 2009 through 2015, analyzed data and reviewed cases pertaining to senior officials involved in misconduct, reviewed procedures pertaining to whistle-blower investigations, and examined a nongeneralizable sample of whistle-blower disclosures from 2010 to 2014. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) collects data related to employee misconduct and disciplinary actions, but fragmentation and data-reliability issues impede department-wide analysis of those data. VA maintains six information systems that include partial data related to employee misconduct. For example, VA's Personnel and Accounting Integrated Data system collects information on disciplinary actions that affect employee leave and pay, but the system does not collect information on other types of disciplinary actions. The system also does not collect information such as the offense or date of occurrence. GAO also identified six other information systems that various VA administrations and program offices use to collect specific information regarding their respective employees' misconduct and disciplinary actions. GAO's analysis of all 12 information systems found data-reliability issues—such as missing data, lack of identifiers, and lack of standardization among fields. Without collecting reliable misconduct and disciplinary action data on all cases department-wide, VA's reporting and decision making on misconduct are impaired. VA inconsistently adhered to its guidance for documentation retention when adjudicating misconduct allegations, based on GAO's review of a generalizable sample of 544 out of 23,622 misconduct case files associated with employee disciplinary actions affecting employee pay. GAO estimates that VA would not be able to account for approximately 1,800 case files. Further, GAO estimates that approximately 3,600 of the files did not contain required documentation that employees were adequately informed of their rights during adjudication procedures—such as their entitlement to be represented by an attorney. The absence of files and associated documentation suggests that individuals may not have always received fair and reasonable due process as allegations of misconduct were adjudicated. Nevertheless, VA's Office of Human Resource Management does not regularly assess the extent to which files and documentation are retained consistently with applicable requirements. VA did not consistently ensure that allegations of misconduct involving senior officials were reviewed according to investigative standards and these officials were held accountable. For example, based on a review of 23 cases of alleged misconduct by senior officials that the VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) referred to VA facility and program offices for additional investigation, GAO found VA frequently did not include sufficient documentation for its findings, or provide a timely response to the OIG. In addition, VA was unable to produce any documentation used to close 2 cases. Further, OIG policy does not require the OIG to verify the completeness of investigations, which would help ensure that facility and program offices had met the requirements for investigating allegations of misconduct. Regarding senior officials, VA did not always take necessary measures to ensure they were held accountable for substantiated misconduct. As the figure below shows, GAO found that the disciplinary action proposed was not taken for 5 of 17 senior officials with substantiated misconduct. As a result of June 2017 legislation, a new office within VA—the Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection—will be responsible for receiving and investigating allegations of misconduct involving senior officials. VA has procedures for investigating whistle-blower complaints, but the procedures allow the program office or facility where a whistle-blower has reported misconduct to conduct the investigation. According to the OIG, it has the option of investigating allegations of misconduct, or exercising a “right of first refusal” whereby it refers allegations of misconduct to the VA facility or program office where the allegation originated. VA does not have oversight measures to ensure that all referred allegations of misconduct are investigated by an entity outside the control of the facility or program office involved in the misconduct, to ensure independence. As a result, GAO found instances where managers investigated themselves for misconduct, presenting a conflict of interest. Data and whistle-blower testimony indicate that retaliation may have occurred at VA. As the table below shows, individuals who filed a disclosure of misconduct with the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) received disciplinary action at a much higher rate than the peer average for the rest of VA in fiscal years 2010–2014. Additionally, GAO's interviews with six VA whistle-blowers who claim to have been retaliated against provided anecdotal evidence that retaliation may be occurring. These whistle-blowers alleged that managers in their chain of command took several untraceable actions to retaliate against the whistle-blowers, such as being denied access to computer equipment necessary to complete assignments. GAO makes numerous recommendations to VA to help enhance its ability to address misconduct issues (several of the recommendations are detailed on the following page). GAO recommends, among other things, that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs develop and implement guidance to collect complete and reliable misconduct and disciplinary-action data department-wide; such guidance should include direction and procedures on addressing blank fields, lack of personnel identifiers, and standardization among fields; direct applicable facility and program offices to adhere to VA's policies regarding misconduct adjudication documentation; direct the Office of Human Resource Management to routinely assess the extent to which misconduct-related files and documents are retained consistently with applicable requirements; direct the Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection (OAWP) to review responses submitted by facility or program offices to ensure evidence produced in senior-official case referrals demonstrates that the required elements have been addressed; direct OAWP to issue written guidance on how OAWP will verify whether appropriate disciplinary action has been implemented; and develop procedures to ensure (1) whistle-blower investigations are reviewed by an official independent of and at least one level above the individual involved in the allegation, and (2) VA employees who report wrongdoing are treated fairly and protected against retaliation. GAO also recommends, among other things, that the VA OIG revise its policy and require verification of evidence produced in senior-official case referrals. VA concurred with nine recommendations and partially concurred with five. In response, GAO modified three of the recommendations.

The mission of the FCC is to make available for all people of the United States, \"without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex, a rapid, efficient, Nationwide, and worldwide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.\" The FCC operates under a public interest mandate first laid out in the 1927 Radio Act (P.L. 632, 69th Congress), but how this mandate is applied depends on how \"the public interest\" is interpreted. Some regulators seek to protect and benefit the public at large through regulation, while others seek to achieve the same goals through the promotion of market efficiency. Additionally, Congress granted the FCC wide latitude and flexibility to revise its interpretation of the public interest standard to reflect changing circumstances and the agency has not defined it in more concrete terms. These circumstances, paired with changes in FCC leadership, have led to significant changes over time in how the FCC regulates the broadcast and telecommunications industries. The FCC is directed by five commissioners appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for five-year terms. The President designates one of the commissioners as chairperson. Three commissioners may be members of the same political party of the President and none can have a financial interest in any commission-related business. The current commissioners are Ajit Pai (Chair), Michael O'Rielly, Brendan Carr, Jessica Rosenworcel, and Geoffrey Starks. The day-to-day functions of the FCC are carried out by 7 bureaus and 10 offices. The current basic structure of the FCC was established in 2002 as part of the agency's effort to better reflect the industries it regulates. The seventh bureau, the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau, was established in 2006. The bureaus process applications for licenses and other filings, manage non-federal spectrum, analyze complaints, conduct investigations, develop and implement regulatory programs, and participate in hearings, among other things. The offices provide support services. Bureaus and offices often collaborate when addressing FCC issues. Beginning in the 110th Congress, the FCC has been funded through the House and Senate Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) appropriations bill as a single line item. Previously, it was funded through what is now the Commerce, Justice, Science appropriations bill, also as a single line item. Since 2009 the FCC's budget has been derived from regulatory fees collected by the agency rather than through a direct appropriation. The fees, often referred to as \"Section (9) fees,\" are collected from license holders and certain other entities. The FCC is authorized to review the regulatory fees each year and adjust them to reflect changes in its appropriation from year to year. Most years, appropriations language prohibits the use by the commission of any excess collections received in the current fiscal year or any prior years. For FY2020, the FCC has requested $335,660,000 in budget authority from regulatory fee offsetting collections. The FCC also requested $132,538,680 in budget authority for the spectrum auctions program."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3388}

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report discusses how the President has used emergency powers throughout U.S. history, both under the Constitution and through statutory laws. It mentions that these powers aren't limited to wartime situations. There are two types: continuously available powers and standby powers that require a national emergency proclamation. Congress can modify or end these powers. \n\nThe report traces the history from the Revolutionary War to modern times, noting that before World War I, Presidents used emergency powers on their own. Then, after WWI, more standby laws were created. The National Emergencies Act of 1976 was a major change, establishing procedures for declaring emergencies and regulating their use. \n\nIt also talks about the philosophical underpinnings, like John Locke's ideas on emergency powers, and how different presidents have interpreted their authority, such as Roosevelt's \"stewardship\" theory versus Taft's more limited view. \n\nThe report includes examples like Lincoln's actions during the Civil War, Wilson and FDR's use of emergency powers, and the 1970s committees that studied these powers. The National Emergencies Act of 1976 is highlighted as a key reform, with its structure and how it affects current emergency declarations. \n\nThere's also a mention of specific cases, like the 2005 Hurricane Katrina response, where the President used a different legal basis than the National Emergencies Act. The summary should cover the historical context, the types of emergency powers, the role of Congress, the National Emergencies Act, and the ongoing debates and examples.\n\nI need to condense all this into one page.

Such powers may be stated explicitly or implied by the Constitution, assumed by the Chief Executive to be permissible constitutionally, or inferred from or specified by statute. Through legislation, Congress has made a great many delegations of authority in this regard over the past 230 years. There are, however, limits and restraints upon the President in his exercise of emergency powers. With the exception of the habeas corpus clause, the Constitution makes no allowance for the suspension of any of its provisions during a national emergency. Disputes over the constitutionality or legality of the exercise of emergency powers are judicially reviewable. Both the judiciary and Congress, as co-equal branches, can restrain the executive regarding emergency powers. So can public opinion. Since 1976, the President has been subject to certain procedural formalities in utilizing some statutorily delegated emergency authority. The National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. §§1601-1651) eliminated or modified some statutory grants of emergency authority, required the President to formally declare the existence of a national emergency and to specify what statutory authority activated by the declaration would be used, and provided Congress a means to countermand the President's declaration and the activated authority being sought.

Revenue from these products increased from 10% to 28% of total mail revenue. The growth is driven by e-commerce, especially last-mile delivery. USPS expects continued growth but faces competition from other delivery services.\n\nThey use scanning technology to track packages, with barcodes scanned up to 13 times. The scanning data helps customers and USPS track packages, optimize operations, and reduce costs. However, there are issues with missed or inaccurate scans, even though the overall scanning rate is high. The report mentions that some districts and post offices have missed scans, leading to potential revenue loss and customer complaints.\n\nUSPS has procedures and training for employees, but the documents are inconsistent and outdated. For example, some handbooks haven't been updated in over a decade. This inconsistency leads to confusion and errors. The report also points out that USPS doesn't follow internal control standards like COSO, which could help improve their processes.\n\nThe GAO recommends that USPS adopt internal control standards, improve communication of procedures, and create standard operating procedures for managers to handle scanning issues. USPS partially agrees, planning a cost study for internal controls and committing to improve procedures by 2018.\n\nI need to condense all this into one page. Start with the growth of competitive products, the role of scanning, the issues with accuracy, the existing procedures and their shortcomings, the recommendations, and USPS's response.

USPS scans these packages at various points throughout the postal network. When scans are inaccurate or missing, questions are raised about the veracity of USPS's data on scanning performance and can lead to customer complaints. GAO was asked to review USPS's scanning policies and procedures. In this report, GAO (1) describes USPS's scanning performance and (2) examines how USPS ensures accurate scanning. GAO reviewed USPS's policies and procedures and assessed them against internal control standards; interviewed officials from USPS and five high-volume mailers; and conducted site visits to six post offices in two USPS districts that represented a range of volume, number of routes, and performance. Mail products over which the United States Postal Service (USPS) does not exercise market dominance, such as many of its packages, are called competitive products. These items are scanned throughout the mail delivery system to track their progress (see figure). USPS data show that these products are almost always scanned. For example, USPS data showed that for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2018; all but one of USPS's 67 districts met their scanning goals. Additionally, mailers that account for a high volume of USPS's competitive products told GAO that they believed USPS was generally scanning products correctly. However, a small percentage of missed or inaccurate scans occur. For example, a report from one USPS district showed that for one week, 0.73 percent of the products delivered were missing a scan and that for the fiscal year to date almost 155,000 competitive products were missing a delivery scan. USPS has designed and implemented procedures and activities to help ensure accurate scanning, but some limitations could contribute to scanning errors. For example, USPS has not based its operational procedures for scanning on any internal control standards. USPS officials said the procedures were based on USPS's unique responsibilities, management experience, and sound business practices, but the officials could not identify specific standards or a framework that they followed as the basis for the procedures. USPS officials said they did not believe any internal controls standards applied to these procedures. By not basing procedures on standards, USPS may miss opportunities to improve how it achieves its mission to scan and measure the performance of competitive products. Additionally, USPS's scanning procedure documents, such as for outlining specific delivery scanning steps, are not always consistent, and USPS relies on more informal methods, such as meetings with employees to communicate changes. Thus, employees may not have accurate procedures available to them. Finally, USPS lacks procedures to help managers identify and address incorrect scans, address customer complaints or otherwise address scanning irregularities. For example, USPS's guidance for managers is limited to a list of bullet-points that do not detail the steps managers should follow to resolve scanning irregularities. In addition, this list has not been updated since 2005. Without consistent or detailed procedures, USPS's employees and managers may not scan items accurately or find information needed to resolve scanning issues—a situation that could hinder USPS's ability to reduce inaccurate or missing scans for these important mail products. GAO recommends that USPS: (1) identify and adopt internal control standards for its operational activities such as for scanning of competitive products; (2) improve the communication of procedures for scanning competitive products; and, (3) create procedures for supervisors on how to address inaccurate scans and resolve scanning issues.

Three space telescope projects are the key enablers for NASA to achieve its astrophysics' science goals, which include seeking to understand the universe. In its fiscal year 2018 budget request, NASA asked for about $697 million for these three projects, which represents over 50 percent of NASA's budget for its astrophysics' major projects. In total, these projects represent an expected investment of at least $12.4 billion. This statement reflects preliminary observations on (1) the current status and cost of NASA's major telescope projects and (2) lessons learned that can be applied to NASA's management of its telescope projects. This statement is based on ongoing work on JWST and ongoing work on the status of NASA's major projects. Both reports are planned to be published in Spring 2018. This statement is also based on past GAO reports on JWST and NASA's acquisitions of major projects, and NASA input. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) current portfolio of major space telescopes includes three projects that vary in cost, complexity, and phase of the acquisition life cycle. GAO's ongoing work indicates that these projects are each making progress in line with their phase of the acquisition cycle but also face some challenges. For example, the current launch date for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) project reflects a 57-60-month delay from the project's original schedule. GAO's preliminary observations indicate this project still has significant integration and testing to complete, with very little schedule reserve remaining to account for delays. Therefore, additional delays beyond the delay of up to 8 months recently announced are likely, and funding available under the $8 billion Congressional cost cap for formulation and development may be inadequate. There are a number of lessons learned from its acquisitions that NASA could consider to increase the likelihood of successful outcomes for its telescope projects, as well as for its larger portfolio of projects, such as its human spaceflight projects. For example, twice in the history of the JWST program, independent reviews found that the program was not holding adequate cost and schedule reserves. GAO has found that NASA has not applied this lesson learned to all of its large projects, and similar outcomes to JWST have started to emerge. For example, NASA did not incorporate this lesson with its human spaceflight programs. In July 2016 and April 2017, GAO found that these programs were holding inadequate levels of cost and schedule reserves to cover unexpected cost increases or delays. In April 2017, GAO recommended that NASA reassess the date of the programs' first test flight. NASA concurred and, in November 2017, announced a launch delay of up to 19 months.

The program guarantees up to $6.5 million per contract, with a potential increase to $10 million if approved by a federal contracting officer. Established in 1971 under the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1970, the program aims to support small businesses, particularly minority and women-owned firms, by reducing the risk for surety companies to bond them. The SBA guarantees 80% to 90% of the loss if a contractor defaults, with the guarantee rate adjusted over time, including a 2016 increase to 90% for the Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Program (PSB). The program has faced challenges, including fluctuating demand, administrative costs, and a decline in surety participation, leading to periodic legislative adjustments to expand the bond limit and improve program efficiency. Despite these challenges, the program has seen a resurgence in recent years due to increased bond limits and improved economic conditions. The SBA continues to work on streamlining processes, such as the Quick Bond Program, to make it easier for small businesses to obtain bonds and compete for contracts. The program's effectiveness is supported by congressional testimony and GAO reports, though determining its optimal size remains a topic of ongoing debate.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report about the SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Program. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report starts by explaining the SBA's role in supporting small businesses through various programs, with a focus on the Surety Bond Guarantee Program. It mentions the program's history, starting in 1971, and its purpose to help small businesses get surety bonds, which are necessary for federal contracts. The program guarantees up to $6.5 million, with a possible increase to $10 million if approved. The SBA covers 80-90% of the loss if a contractor defaults. \n\nThere's a lot of legislative history here, like the 1970 act that authorized the program, and subsequent changes over the years, including the creation of the Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Program (PSB) in 1988. The guarantee rates were adjusted, especially in 2016 when they were increased to 90% for PSB.

The program guarantees individual contracts of up to $6.5 million, and up to $10 million if a federal contracting officer certifies that such a guarantee is necessary. The SBA's guarantee currently ranges from 80% to 90% of the surety's loss if a default occurs. In FY2018, the SBA guaranteed 10,800 bid and final surety bonds with a total contract value of nearly $6.5 billion. A surety bond is a three-party instrument between a surety (who agrees to be responsible for the debt or obligation of another), a contractor, and a project owner. The agreement binds the contractor to comply with the contract's terms and conditions. If the contractor is unable to successfully perform the contract, the surety assumes the contractor's responsibilities and ensures that the project is completed. Surety bonds encourage project owners to contract with small businesses that may not have the credit history or prior experience of larger businesses and may be at greater risk of failing to comply with the contract's terms and conditions. Surety bonds are important to small businesses interested in competing for federal contracts because the federal government requires prime contractors—prior to the award of a federal contract exceeding $150,000 for the construction, alteration, or repair of any building or public work of the United States—to furnish a performance bond issued by a surety satisfactory to the contracting officer in an amount that the officer considers adequate to protect the government. P.L. 112-239, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, increased the program's bond limit to $6.5 million, or up to $10 million if a federal contracting officer certifies that such a guarantee is necessary. The limit had been $2 million since 2000, with a temporary increase from February 17, 2009, through September 30, 2010, to $5 million, and up to $10 million if a federal contracting officer certified in writing that such a guarantee was necessary. Advocates of raising the program's bond limit argued that doing so would increase contracting opportunities for small businesses and bring the limit more in line with limits of other small business programs, such as the 8(a) Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development Program and the Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Program. Opponents argued that raising the limit could lead to higher amounts being guaranteed by the SBA and, as a result, increase the risk of program losses. This report examines the program's origin and development, including (1) the decision to supplement the original Prior Approval Program with the Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Program that initially provided a lower guarantee rate (not to exceed 70%) than the Prior Approval Program (not to exceed 80% or 90%, depending on the size of the contract and the type of small business) in exchange for allowing preferred sureties to issue SBA-guaranteed surety bonds without the SBA's prior approval; (2) P.L. 114-92, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, which increased the Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Program's guarantee rate from not to exceed 70% to not to exceed 90% of losses; and (3) the decision to increase the program's bond limit."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8920}

However, some challenges remain, such as rounding errors in income and expenses, with 25% of reports not rounding as required in 2017. Additionally, 15% of LD-2 reports may not have properly disclosed previously held covered positions. The U.S. Attorney’s Office (USAO) is responsible for enforcing LDA compliance, with the ability to impose civil or criminal penalties for noncompliance. The report also notes that while most lobbying firms find the disclosure requirements “very easy” or “somewhat easy” to comply with, some issues persist, such as difficulty in locating noncompliant lobbyists and challenges in verifying political contributions.

Also, mention the methodology used in the report, like the sample", "answers": ["The LDA, as amended, requires lobbyists to file quarterly disclosure reports and semiannual reports on certain political contributions. The law also includes a provision for GAO to annually audit lobbyists' compliance with the LDA.

This is GAO's 11th report under the provision. GAO reviewed a stratified random sample of 98 quarterly disclosure LD-2 reports filed for the third and fourth quarters of calendar year 2016 and the first and second quarters of calendar year 2017. GAO also reviewed two random samples totaling 160 LD-203 reports from year-end 2016 and midyear 2017. This methodology allowed GAO to generalize to the population of 45,818 disclosure reports with $5,000 or more in lobbying activity, and 30,594 reports of federal political campaign contributions. GAO also met with officials from USAO to obtain status updates on its efforts to focus resources on lobbyists who fail to comply. GAO is not making any recommendations in this report. GAO provided a draft of this report to the Department of Justice for review and comment. The Department of Justice provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. For the 2017 reporting period, most lobbyists provided documentation for key elements of their disclosure reports to demonstrate compliance with the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, as amended (LDA). For lobbying disclosure (LD-2) reports and political contributions (LD-203) reports filed during the third and fourth quarter of 2016 and the first and second quarter of 2017, GAO estimates that 87 percent of lobbyists filed reports as required for the quarter in which they first registered; the figure below describes the filing process and enforcement; 99 percent of all lobbyists who filed (up from 83 percent in 2016) could provide documentation for income and expenses; and 93 percent filed year-end 2016 LD-203 reports as required. These findings are generally consistent with prior reports GAO issued for the 2010 through 2016 reporting periods. However, in recent years GAO's findings showed some variation in the estimated percentage of reports with supporting documentation. For example, an estimated increase in lobbyists who could document expenses is notable in 2017 and represents a statistically significant increase from 2016. As in GAO's other reports, some lobbyists were still unclear about the need to disclose certain previously held covered positions, such as paid congressional internships or certain executive agency positions. GAO estimates that 15 percent of all LD-2 reports may not have properly disclosed previously held covered positions. On the other hand, over the past several years of reporting on lobbying disclosure, GAO found that most lobbyists in the sample rated the terms associated with LD-2 reporting as “very easy” or “somewhat easy” to understand.

Overall, the SBA's appropriations have ranged from a high of $2.359 billion in FY2018 to a low of $571.8 million in FY2007. Much of this volatility is due to significant variation in appropriations for disaster assistance, which ranged from a high of $1.7 billion in FY2006 to a low of $0 in FY2009. This variation can be attributed primarily to supplemental appropriations provided to address disaster needs arising from the impact of major hurricanes, such as Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, and more recently, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. The SBA's appropriations for business loan credit subsidies have also varied since FY2000, ranging from a high of $319.7 million in FY2013 ($337.3 million before sequestration and rescission) to a low of $1.3 million in FY2006 and FY2007. This variation is due to the impact of changing economic conditions on the SBA's guaranteed loan portfolios. During good economic times, revenue from SBA fees and collateral liquidation is typically sufficient to cover the costs of purchasing guaranteed loans that have defaulted. During and immediately following recessions, however, that revenue is typically insufficient to cover the costs of purchasing guaranteed loans that have defaulted.

{"pred": " The report examines the financial status and future outlook of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund (Trust Fund), which provides benefits to miners and their dependents affected by black lung disease. Key findings include:\n\n- **Benefits and Funding**: The Trust Fund provides cash assistance and medical benefits to beneficiaries, with cash payments ranging from $650 to $1,300 per month in 2017. Medical benefits cover treatment costs, averaging $6,980 annually per miner. In 2017, about 25,700 beneficiaries received benefits, though the number has declined due to fewer miners and an aging population. However, there is a potential increase in claims due to rising black lung disease cases, particularly in Appalachian regions.\n\n- **Trust Fund Operations**: Claims are processed by the Department of Labor (DOL), with contested claims adjudicated by the Office of Administrative Law Judges. Benefits are funded by mine operators or the Trust Fund, with the latter relying on coal taxes and other revenue sources. The Trust Fund has faced persistent financial challenges, with expenditures consistently exceeding revenue since its inception, leading to significant debt.\n\n- **Debt and Financial Challenges**: The Trust Fund has accumulated over $4.3 billion in debt by 2017, primarily due to the coal tax rates not covering expenses. The 2008 Energy Independence and Security Act (EIEA) extended tax rates and provided debt forgiveness, but the Trust Fund still faces deficits. Simulations suggest that the scheduled 2019 tax rate decrease will further strain the Trust Fund, potentially leading to a $15.4 billion deficit by 2050.\n\n- **Options for Improvement**: The report evaluates various options to address the Trust Fund’s financial issues, including adjusting coal tax rates, forgiving debt or interest, and modifying the tax structure. Increasing tax rates by 25% could eliminate debt by 2050, while maintaining current rates with $2.4 billion in debt forgiveness could balance the fund. Other options, such as eliminating the tax cap or creating a variable tax, are also discussed.\n\n- **Conclusion**: The Trust Fund’s financial sustainability is at risk, and without intervention, it will require continued borrowing from the federal government. The report highlights the need for policy decisions to address the Trust Fund’s long-term viability, balancing the burden between the coal industry and taxpayers.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report. Let me start by reading through the user's", "answers": ["With revenue of about $450 million in fiscal year 2017, the Trust Fund paid about $184 million in benefits to more than 25,000 coal miners and eligible dependents. However, the Trust Fund also borrowed about $1.3 billion from the Treasury's general fund in fiscal year 2017 to cover its debt repayment expenditures. Adding to this financial challenge, the coal tax that supports the Trust Fund is scheduled to decrease by about 55 percent beginning in 2019. GAO was asked to review the financial positon of the Trust Fund and identify options to improve it. This report examines (1) factors that have challenged the financial position of the Trust Fund since its inception and (2) the extent to which Trust Fund debt may change through 2050, and selected options that could improve its future financial position. GAO reviewed Trust Fund financial data from fiscal years 1979 through 2017. GAO also interviewed officials from the Departments of Labor, Treasury, Health and Human Services (HHS) and representatives of coal industry and union groups. Using assumptions, such as the about 55 percent coal tax decrease and moderately declining coal production, GAO simulated the extent to which Trust Fund debt may change through 2050. GAO also simulated how selected options, such as forgiveness of debt, could improve finances. The options simulated are not intended to be exhaustive. Further, GAO is not endorsing any particular option or combination of options. GAO provided a draft of this report to DOL, Treasury, and HHS. The agencies provided technical comments, which were incorporated as appropriate. Multiple factors have challenged Black Lung Disability Trust Fund (Trust Fund) finances since it was established about 40 years ago. Its expenditures have consistently exceeded its revenues, interest payments have grown, and actions taken that were expected to improve Trust Fund finances did not completely address its debt. When necessary to make expenditures, the Trust Fund borrows with interest from the Department of the Treasury's (Treasury) general fund. Because Trust Fund expenditures have consistently exceeded revenue, it has borrowed almost every year since 1979, its first complete fiscal year, and as a result debt and interest payments increased. Legislative actions were taken over the years including (1) raising the rate of the coal tax that provides Trust Fund revenues and (2) forgiving debt. For example, the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 provided an appropriation toward Trust Fund debt forgiveness; about $6.5 billion was forgiven, according to Department of Labor (DOL) data (see figure). However, coal tax revenues were less than expected due, in part, to the 2008 recession and increased competition from other energy sources, according to DOL and Treasury officials. As a result, the Trust Fund continued to borrow from Treasury's general fund from fiscal years 2010 through 2017 to cover debt repayment expenditures. GAO's simulation suggests that Trust Fund borrowing will likely increase from fiscal years 2019 through 2050 due, in part, to the coal tax rate decrease of about 55 percent that will take effect in 2019 and declining coal production. The simulation estimates that Trust Fund borrowing may exceed $15 billion by 2050 (see figure). However, various options, such as adjusting the coal tax and forgiving interest or debt, could reduce future borrowing and improve the Trust Fund's financial position. For example, maintaining the current coal tax rates and forgiving debt of $2.4 billion could, under certain circumstances, balance the Trust Fund by 2050, whereby revenue would be sufficient to cover expenditures. However, a coal industry representative said that maintaining or increasing the coal tax would burden the coal industry, particularly at a time when coal production has been declining. Further, Treasury officials noted that the costs associated with forgiving Trust Fund interest or debt would be paid by taxpayers."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5783}
{"pred": " \n\nThe report examines how selected federal agencies assess whether personal property is needed and how they dispose of unneeded personal property, with a focus on how space reduction efforts have affected these processes. Federal agencies manage a wide range of personal property, including common items like computers and furniture, as well as specialized equipment. While agencies are required by law to maintain inventory controls, identify excess property, and dispose of it in accordance with GSA regulations, many do not have systematic processes for identifying unneeded property. The report highlights that agencies often rely on \"triggering events\" such as office moves or consolidations to determine excess property, rather than proactive assessments. This can lead to inefficiencies, as unneeded property may remain in storage or be sold at a loss. The General Services Administration (GSA) provides a disposal process that includes transferring, donating, selling, or abandoning property, but agencies often lack the policies and procedures to effectively implement these steps. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has the authority to issue guidance to reinforce these requirements, and the report recommends that OMB provide clear guidance to agencies on managing personal property. The report also notes that while some agencies have made progress in reducing office and warehouse space through initiatives like \"Freeze the Footprint\" and \"Reduce the Footprint,\" they face challenges in managing the associated personal property. The report concludes that improving property management practices can lead to better resource utilization, cost savings, and more efficient operations.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report.

By law, each agency is required to follow GSA's disposal process so that an agency's unneeded property can be used by other agencies or certain non-federal entities. Since 2012, agencies have reduced their office and warehouse space due to government-wide initiatives, a reduction that in turn has required agencies to dispose of some affected personal property. GAO was asked to review how federal agencies identify and dispose of unneeded personal property. This report examines (1) how selected agencies assess whether personal property is needed and (2) how these agencies dispose of unneeded property and how, if at all, space reduction efforts have affected disposals. GAO reviewed federal statutes and regulations, and selected five agencies—EPA, Forest Service, GSA, HUD, and IRS—mainly based on space reduction results and goals. GAO reviewed these agencies' property disposal data for 2012 through 2016 and interviewed headquarters and field staff about their property management and disposal processes. The five agencies GAO reviewed—the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Forest Service, General Services Administration (GSA), Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and Internal Revenue Service (IRS)—generally do not have policies or processes for identifying unneeded personal property, such as office furniture, on a proactive basis. Instead, officials from these agencies said they typically identified unneeded property as a result of a “triggering event,” such as an office space reduction. Executive agencies are required by law to continuously review property under their control to identify unneeded personal property and then dispose of it promptly. Without such policies or processes, agencies may not be routinely identifying unneeded property that could be used elsewhere, and efforts to maximize federal personal property use and minimize unnecessary storage costs may not be effective. GSA has issued regulations establishing a government-wide disposal process for unneeded personal property. However, according to GSA officials, the agency lacks the authority to promulgate regulations or formal guidance on management of in-use agency property, and there is no government-wide guidance to agencies on identifying unneeded personal property. Agencies are required to have internal control activities—such as policies and procedures—for reasonable assurance of efficient operations and minimal resource waste, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides guidance to agencies on implementing such activities. Guidance from OMB that emphasizes agencies' internal control responsibilities could help ensure that agencies are proactively and regularly identifying property that is no longer needed. The selected agencies reported little difficulty in following GSA's personal property disposal process, reporting over 37,000 items as unneeded property in fiscal years 2012 through 2016. This property was disposed of through transfers to other agencies, donations to authorized recipients, sales, or discarding. When disposing of personal property from space reduction projects at locations GAO visited, agencies also reported using GSA's process (see figure). Overall, agencies said they have not experienced major challenges with disposing of personal property from space reduction efforts. This lack of challenges could be because projects are geographically dispersed and spread over several years.

GAO analyzed documents and interviewed officials from State, USAID, HHS, USDA, and the organizations. GAO also analyzed a nongeneralizable sample of 12 of the 60 assistance agreements that were awarded by State, USAID, HHS, and USDA to OAS, PAHO, and IICA and were active during calendar years 2014 through 2016. For each agency, GAO selected three agreements with the lowest, median, and highest dollar value. GAO found that strategic goals of the Organization of American States (OAS), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA), and the Pan-American Institute of Geography and History (PAIGH) are predominantly aligned with the strategic goals of the Department of State (State), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). For example, IICA's strategic goals of a productive agricultural sector, enhancing agricultural development, and food security are aligned with USDA's foreign assistance goals. State, USAID, HHS, and USDA fund activities in the form of assistance agreements (e.g., grants and cooperative agreements) with OAS, PAHO, and IICA, which in 2016 totaled $32 million. According to agency officials, the agencies employ mechanisms to ensure that these agreements align with U.S. strategic goals. OAS, PAHO, IICA, and PAIGH have established mechanisms for overseeing their use of funds, such as external auditors, internal audit boards, and anti-fraud and ethics policies. State and USDA have directly supported these mechanisms. For example, State engaged in the selection process for OAS's Inspector General. GAO's review of 12 selected assistance agreements found that USDA included no financial or performance monitoring provisions in one of its agreements and that State did not include two key monitoring provisions in one of its agreements, called for by applicable guidance. GAO found that the remaining 10 agreements it reviewed contained all key monitoring provisions and that State has since taken corrective action. GAO found that U.S. agencies did not have full documentation of 18 of the 42 monitoring activities required by the 12 assistance agreements GAO reviewed (see table). For example, USDA did not have full documentation, such as for financial reports, of any of its 10 required monitoring activities and USDA officials did not explain their lack of documentation. USAID officials explained that their lack of full documentation was due, in part, to grant officers not always following their document management policies. State and HHS have since taken corrective action.

Changes in the market for counterfeit goods entering the United States pose new challenges for consumers, the private sector, and U.S. agencies that enforce intellectual property rights (IPR). Specifically, growth in e-commerce has contributed to a shift in the sale of counterfeit goods in the United States, with consumers increasingly purchasing goods online and counterfeiters producing a wider variety of goods that may be sold on websites alongside authentic products. For example, 20 of 47 items GAO purchased from third-party sellers on popular consumer websites were counterfeit, according to testing by the products' rights holders (see table), highlighting potential risks to consumers. The changes in the market for counterfeit goods can also pose challenges to the private sector—for example, the challenge of distinguishing counterfeit from authentic goods listed for sale online—and complicate the enforcement efforts of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). CBP and ICE engage in a number of activities to enhance IPR enforcement; however, while ICE has assessed some of its efforts, CBP has taken limited steps to do so. CBP's and ICE's IPR enforcement activities broadly include detecting imports of potentially IPR-infringing goods, conducting special operations at U.S. ports, engaging with international partners, and undertaking localized pilot programs or port-led initiatives. CBP and ICE have collected some performance data for each of the eight activities GAO reviewed, and ICE has taken some steps to understand the impact of its efforts. However, CBP has conducted limited evaluation of its efforts to enhance IPR enforcement. Consequently, CBP may lack information needed to ensure it is investing its resources in the most efficient and effective activities. CBP and ICE generally collaborate on IPR enforcement, but according to private sector representatives, restrictions on CBP's information sharing limit private sector enforcement efforts. GAO found that CBP and ICE have undertaken efforts that align with selected key practices for interagency collaboration, such as participating in developing a national IPR enforcement strategy and agreeing on roles and responsibilities. However, sharing additional information about seized items with rights-holding companies and e-commerce websites could improve enforcement, according to private sector representatives. CBP officials said they share information to the extent allowed under current regulations, but CBP has not completed an assessment of what, if any, additional information would be beneficial to share with private sector entities.

This report responds to some frequently asked questions about TANF; it does not describe TANF rules (see, instead, CRS Report RL32748, The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Block Grant: A Primer on TANF Financing and Federal Requirements, by Gene Falk). TANF Funding and Expenditures. TANF provides fixed funding for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the territories, and American Indian tribes. The basic block grant totals $16.5 billion per year. States are also required in total to contribute, from their own funds, at least $10.3 billion annually under a maintenance-of-effort (MOE) requirement. Though TANF is best known for funding cash assistance payments for needy families with children, the block grant and MOE funds are used for a wide variety of benefits and activities. In FY2017, expenditures on basic assistance totaled $7.1 billion—23% of total federal TANF and MOE dollars. Basic assistance is often—but not exclusively—paid as cash. In addition to funding basic assistance, TANF also contributes funds for child care and services for children who have been, or are at risk of being, abused and neglected. Some states also count expenditures in prekindergarten programs toward the MOE requirement. The TANF Assistance Caseload. A total of 1.2 million families, composed of 3.1 million recipients, received TANF- or MOE-funded assistance in September 2018. The bulk of the \"recipients\" were children—2.3 million in that month. The assistance caseload is heterogeneous. The type of family once thought of as the \"typical\" assistance family—one with an unemployed adult recipient—accounted for 32% of all families on the rolls in FY2016. Additionally, 31% of cash assistance families had an employed adult, while 38% of all TANF families were \"child-only\" and had no adult recipient. Child-only families include those with disabled adults receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI), adults who are nonparents (e.g., grandparents, aunts, uncles) caring for children, and families consisting of citizen children and ineligible noncitizen parents. Cash Assistance Benefits. TANF cash benefit amounts are set by states. In July 2017, the maximum monthly benefit for a family of three ranged from $1,021 in New Hampshire to $170 in Mississippi. Only New Hampshire (at 60% of the federal poverty guidelines) had a maximum TANF cash assistance amount for this sized family in excess of 50% of poverty-level income. Work Requirements. TANF's main federal work requirement is actually a performance measure that applies to the states. States determine the work rules that apply to individual recipients. TANF law requires states to engage 50% of all families and 90% of two-parent families with work-eligible individuals in work activities, though these standards can be reduced by \"credits.\" Therefore, the effective standards states face are often less than the 50% or 90% targets, and vary by state. In FY2017, states achieved, on average, an all-family participation rate of 53.0% and a two-parent rate of 69.5%. In FY2017, two jurisdictions did not meet the all-family participation standard: Nevada and Guam. This is a reduction from FY2012, when 16 states did not meet that standard.

The report discusses changes in Medicare payment rates for lab tests after the implementation of PAMA in 2018. \n\nFirst, before 2018, Medicare used the CLFS with rates based on 1984-1985 data adjusted for inflation, and there were 57 different fee schedules. Payment rates were the minimum of the lab's claim, local fee, or national limit. Panel tests had bundled rates, and the payment was based on the number of tests. \n\nThen, PAMA in 2018 replaced the 57 fee schedules with a single national schedule based on private-payer rates from 2016. For individual tests, the payment was the median private rate, weighted by volume. Panel tests without billing codes were paid separately for each component, while those with codes could be billed as a panel or individually. \n\nThe report also mentions that CMS collected data from about 2,000 labs, but not all complied, leading to potential inaccuracies. The new rates were lower than previous ones, but CMS used the 2017 national limitation amounts as a base, leading to higher payments than necessary. There were concerns about unbundling panel tests, which increased Medicare expenditures. \n\nThe GAO made three recommendations: collect all data, phase in reductions from actual past rates, and use bundled rates for panel tests.

These tests help health care providers prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases. PAMA included a provision for GAO to review CMS's implementation of new payment rates for these tests. This report addresses, among other objectives, (1) how CMS developed the new payment rates; (2) challenges CMS faced in setting accurate payment rates and what factors may have mitigated these challenges; and (3) the potential effect of the new payment rates on Medicare expenditures. GAO analyzed 2016 Medicare claims data (the most recent data available when GAO started its work and the year on which new payment rates were based) and private-payer data CMS collected. GAO also interviewed CMS and industry officials. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) revised the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS) for 2018, establishing new Medicare payment rates for laboratory services. Prior to 2018, these rates were based on historical laboratory fees and were typically higher than the rates paid by private payers. The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA) required CMS to develop a national fee schedule for laboratory tests based on private-payer data. To revise the rates, CMS collected data on private-payer rates from approximately 2,000 laboratories and calculated median payment rates, weighted by volume. GAO found that the median private-payer rates were lower than Medicare's maximum payment rates in 2017 for 88 percent of tests. CMS is gradually phasing in reductions to Medicare payment rates, limited annually at 10 percent over a 3-year period (2018 through 2020), as outlined in PAMA. CMS relied on laboratories to determine whether they met data reporting requirements, but agency officials told GAO that CMS did not receive data from all laboratories required to report. CMS did not estimate the amount of data it should have received from laboratories that were required to report but did not. CMS took steps to exclude inaccurate private-payer data and estimated how collecting certain types and amounts of additional private-payer data could affect Medicare expenditures. However, it is not known whether CMS's estimates reflect the actual risk of incomplete data resulting in inaccurate Medicare payment rates. GAO found that PAMA's phased in reductions to new Medicare payment rates likely mitigated this risk of inaccurate Medicare payment rates from 2018 through 2020. However, GAO found that collecting incomplete data could have a larger effect on the accuracy of Medicare payment rates in future years when PAMA allows for greater payment-rate reductions. CMS's implementation of the new payment rates could lead Medicare to pay billions of dollars more than is necessary and result in CLFS expenditures increasing from what Medicare paid prior to 2018 for two reasons. First, CMS used the maximum Medicare payment rates in 2017 as a baseline to start the phase in of payment-rate reductions instead of using actual Medicare payment rates. This resulted in excess payments for some laboratory tests and, in some cases, higher payment rates than those Medicare previously paid, on average. GAO estimated that Medicare expenditures from 2018 through 2020 may be $733 million more than if CMS had phased in payment-rate reductions based on the average payment rates in 2016. Second, CMS stopped paying a bundled payment rate for certain panel tests (groups of laboratory tests generally performed together), as was its practice prior to 2018, because CMS had not yet clarified its authority to do so under PAMA, according to officials. CMS is currently reviewing whether it has the authority to bundle payment rates for panel tests to reflect the efficiency of conducting a group of tests. GAO estimated that if the payment rate for each panel test were unbundled, Medicare expenditures could increase by as much as $10.3 billion from 2018 through 2020 compared to estimated Medicare expenditures using lower bundled payment rates for panel tests. GAO recommends that the Administrator of CMS (1) collect complete private-payer data from all laboratories required to report or address the estimated effects of incomplete data, (2) phase in payment-rate reductions that start from the actual payment rates rather than the maximum payment rates Medicare paid prior to 2018, and (3) use bundled rates for panel tests. HHS concurred with GAO's first recommendation, neither agreed nor disagreed with the other two, and has since issued guidance to help address the third. GAO believes CMS should fully address these recommendations to prevent Medicare from paying more than is necessary."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6322}

While the nature of lawmakers' interest in bank regulation has shifted over time, most bank regulations fall into one of three general categories. First, banks must abide by a variety of safety-and-soundness requirements designed to minimize the risk of their failure and maintain macroeconomic stability. Second, banks must comply with consumer protection rules intended to deter abusive practices and provide consumers with complete information about financial products and services. Third, banks are subject to various reporting, recordkeeping, and anti-money laundering requirements designed to assist law enforcement in investigating criminal activity. The substantive content of these requirements remains the subject of intense debate. However, the division of regulatory authority over banks between the federal government and the states plays a key role in shaping that content. In some cases, federal law displaces (or \"preempts\") state bank regulations. In other cases, states are permitted to supplement federal regulations with different, sometimes stricter requirements. Because of its substantive implications, federal preemption has recently become a flashpoint in debates surrounding bank regulation. In the American \"dual banking system,\" banks can apply for a national charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) or a state charter from a state's banking authority. A bank's choice of chartering authority is also a choice of primary regulator, as the OCC serves as the primary regulator of national banks and state regulatory agencies serve as the primary regulators of state-chartered banks. However, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) also play an important role in bank regulation. The Federal Reserve supervises all national banks and state-chartered banks that become members of the Federal Reserve System (FRS), while the FDIC supervises all state banks that do not become members of the FRS. This complex regulatory architecture has resulted in a \"symbiotic system\" with both federal regulation of state banks and state regulation of national banks. In the modern dual banking system, national banks are often subject to generally applicable state laws, and state banks are subject to both generally applicable federal laws and regulations imposed by their federal regulators. The evolution of this system during the 20th century caused the regulation of national banks and state banks to converge in a number of important ways. However, despite this convergence, federal preemption provides national banks with certain unique advantages. In Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson, the Supreme Court held that the National Bank Act (NBA) preempts state laws that \"significantly interfere\" with the powers of national banks. The Court has also issued two decisions on the preemptive scope of a provision of the NBA limiting states' \"visitorial powers\" over national banks. Finally, OCC rules have taken a broad view of the preemptive effects of the NBA, limiting the ways in which states can regulate national banks. Courts, regulators, and legislators have recently confronted a number of issues involving banking preemption and related federalism questions. Specifically, Congress has considered legislation that would overturn a line of judicial decisions concerning the circumstances in which non-banks can benefit from federal preemption of state usury laws. The OCC has also announced its intention to grant national bank charters to certain financial technology (FinTech) companies—a decision that is currently being litigated. Finally, Congress has recently turned its attention to the banking industry's response to state efforts to legalize and regulate marijuana."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8713}

The main issues for Congress are whether to approve the funding, how many oilers the Navy needs in the future, and whether to add more self-defense equipment to the ships. \n\nThe report explains the role of fleet oilers: they refuel and resupply other ships, which is crucial for sustained operations. The current fleet has 15 Kaiser-class ships, which are aging. The TAO-205s are supposed to replace them. The design is similar to the Kaiser-class but with double hulls for environmental and spill protection.

Let me start by outlining the key sections. The report discusses three service classifications: competitive service, except", "answers": ["According to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the federal workforce consists of an estimated two million civilian employees. Federal law categorizes these employees into three types of service—the competitive service, the excepted service, and the Senior Executive Service (SES)—that may be distinguished by different selection, compensation, and other standards. Title 5 of the U.S. Code (Title 5) contains most of the standards governing federal employment, and OPM is generally responsible for implementing these requirements. The competitive service largely consists of all civil service positions in the executive branch, other than (1) positions excepted from the competitive service by statute; (2) positions appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate; and (3) the SES. Traditionally, OPM has administered examinations for entrance into the competitive service. These examinations are meant to be \"practical in character\" and relate to \"matters that fairly test the relative capacity and fitness of the applicants for the appointment sought.\" Title 5 also authorizes OPM to prescribe rules allowing agencies to hire candidates directly under specified circumstances. The excepted service includes designated civil service positions that are not in the competitive service or the SES and are not subject to competitive examination. OPM maintains authority to exempt a position from the competitive service when it determines that an appointment through competitive examination is not practicable, or the recruitment of students or recent graduates would be better achieved through alternate recruitment and assessment processes. The pay structure for the competitive service and the excepted service is similar. Both services are typically paid in accordance with the General Schedule, a schedule of annual basic pay rates that consists of 15 grades, designated \"GS-1\" through \"GS-15.\" This fixed pay scale is generally designed to reflect, among other things, equal pay for substantially equal work within a local pay area. Additionally, the competitive service and the excepted service generally have similar notice and appeal rights for adverse personnel actions. For example, before a removal, a suspension for more than 14 days, a reduction in grade or pay, or a furlough of 30 days or less, the agency must provide at least 30 days' advance written notice to the affected employee. The employee must also be given a reasonable time to respond to the notice and provide affidavits and other evidence to support the answer. Some adverse actions may also be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB or Board), an independent, quasi-judicial agency that reviews and adjudicates specified personnel actions taken against qualifying federal employees. The SES is a corps of some 7,000 high-level government administrators who manage major programs and projects within most federal agencies. In these leadership roles, SES members may serve as a link between top-level political appointees of an agency and career civil servants within the agency. The SES is governed by a regulatory structure separate from the competitive and excepted services. While SES members are primarily career appointees chosen through a merit-based competitive hiring process, others are noncareer, limited term or limited emergency appointees (commonly political appointees) selected by agency leadership. To shield certain SES roles from political influence, some SES positions (career reserved positions) must be filled with career appointees, and Title 5 limits the number of noncareer and limited term appointees that may serve in SES positions. The SES pay structure is distinct from the rest of the civil service. Title 5 specifies that SES members are paid within a particular range based on an executive's individual performance or contribution to agency performance (or both), as measured under a performance appraisal system. In addition, Title 5 articulates special conditions and procedures for removing, suspending, or taking other adverse actions against a member of the SES. For example, career SES appointees who have successfully completed a one-year probationary period may be removed or subject to adverse action only for specified reasons, including misconduct and substandard performance. Career appointees must receive advance written notice of these actions, and an opportunity to appeal the action. In comparison, noncareer, limited term, and limited emergency appointees are generally not subject to the same protections and may be removed from the SES at any time."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2697}

The U.S.", "answers": ["China's actions in recent years in the South China Sea (SCS)—particularly its island-building and base-construction activities at sites that it occupies in the Spratly Islands—have heightened concerns among U.S. observers that China is rapidly gaining effective control of the SCS, an area of strategic, political, and economic importance to the United States and its allies and partners, particularly those in the Indo-Pacific region. U.S. Navy Admiral Philip Davidson, in his responses to advance policy questions from the Senate Armed Services Committee for an April 17, 2018, hearing to consider his nomination to become Commander, U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM), stated that \"China is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in all scenarios short of war with the United States.\" Chinese control of the SCS—and, more generally, Chinese domination of China's near-seas region, meaning the SCS, the East China Sea (ECS), and the Yellow Sea—could substantially affect U.S. strategic, political, and economic interests in the Indo-Pacific region and elsewhere. China is a party to multiple territorial disputes in the SCS and ECS, including, in particular, disputes with multiple neighboring countries over the Paracel Islands, Spratly Islands, and Scarborough Shoal in the SCS, and with Japan over the Senkaku Islands in the ECS. Up through 2014, U.S. concern over these disputes centered more on their potential for causing tension, incidents, and a risk of conflict between China and its neighbors in the region, including U.S. allies Japan and the Philippines and emerging partner states such as Vietnam. While that concern remains, particularly regarding the potential for a conflict between China and Japan involving the Senkaku Islands, U.S. concern since 2014 (i.e., since China's island-building activities in the Spratly Islands were first publicly reported) has shifted increasingly to how China's strengthening position in the SCS may be affecting the risk of a U.S.-China crisis or conflict in the SCS and the broader U.S.-Chinese strategic competition. In addition to territorial disputes in the SCS and ECS, China is involved in a dispute, particularly with the United States, over whether China has a right under international law to regulate the activities of foreign military forces operating within China's exclusive economic zone (EEZ). The position of the United States and most other countries is that while international law gives coastal states the right to regulate economic activities (such as fishing and oil exploration) within their EEZs, it does not give coastal states the right to regulate foreign military activities in the parts of their EEZs beyond their 12-nautical-mile territorial waters. The position of China and some other countries (i.e., a minority group among the world's nations) is that UNCLOS gives coastal states the right to regulate not only economic activities, but also foreign military activities, in their EEZs. The dispute appears to be at the heart of multiple incidents between Chinese and U.S. ships and aircraft in international waters and airspace since 2001, and has potential implications not only for China's EEZs, but for U.S. naval operations in EEZs globally, and for international law of the sea. A key issue for Congress is how the United States should respond to China's actions in the SCS and ECS—particularly its island-building and base-construction activities in the Spratly Islands—and to China's strengthening position in the SCS. A key oversight question for Congress is whether the Trump Administration has an appropriate strategy—and an appropriate amount of resources for implementing that strategy—for countering China's \"salami-slicing\" strategy or gray zone operations for gradually strengthening its position in the SCS, for imposing costs on China for its actions in the SCS and ECS, and for defending and promoting U.S. interests in the region."], "all_classes": null, "length": 40508}

The report outlines the different funding mechanisms, including mission funding, customer funding, and the Navy Working Capital Fund, and discusses the challenges in utilizing these funds effectively. It also examines the use of four key legislative authorities: Laboratory Initiated Research Authority, Direct Hire Authorities, Laboratory Enhancement Pilot Program, and Micro-purchase Authority, which aim to enhance innovation and efficiency in DOD labs. The report identifies barriers to the full utilization of these authorities, such as bureaucratic constraints, financial management issues, and policy limitations. It further explores the role of Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) and University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs) in supporting DOD's research and development needs, noting their unique governance models and challenges.

The Navy uses a revolving fund, while the Air Force and Army rely on other funding models. \n\nThen there are the legislative authorities that help the labs", "answers": ["Congress created several authorities that provide DOD research labs with ways to increase efficiency and foster innovation. Senate report 114-255 contained a provision for GAO to study governance models used by federal labs. This report evaluates DOD labs' use of authorities to foster innovation and efficiency. GAO selected four authorities that recent work on best practices for science and technology management and expedited defense lab hiring have shown to be the most crucial for supporting innovation; administered a survey to 44 lab directors to gain insight into their use of the authorities; interviewed key lab officials and contractors; and reviewed relevant policies and guidance. Congress has provided the Department of Defense's (DOD) research labs with several authorities to enhance management and operations. Four authorities that GAO examined provide lab directors with greater ability to make their own decisions regarding the funding of projects, hiring, lab management, and purchasing of equipment or services. 1. Laboratory initiated research authority. This authority, as implemented, provides labs with a means to fund new science and technology projects that they consider a priority. Labs may use a percentage of all funds available to the lab and are permitted to charge customers of the lab a percentage fee of the costs for activities performed by the lab for the customer. 2. Direct hire authority. This authority enables labs to compete with private industry for high-quality talent. For example, it provides for streamlined hiring of applicants with relevant advanced degrees, or students enrolled in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics programs. 3. Laboratory enhancement pilot program authority. This authority generally allows lab directors to propose alternative methods that might lead to more effective lab management, and waive certain policies or procedures that might affect implementation of these methods. 4. Micro-purchase authority. This authority raises the threshold for small purchases for DOD research lab activities from $3,500 to $10,000 to facilitate acquisitions. While labs have used these authorities, their use has sometimes been limited, particularly with the laboratory initiated research authority. DOD lab directors at Air Force, Navy, and Army cited several obstacles that impede wider use of that authority, specifically: Air Force: Financial management officials at the Air Force stated that the service's accounting system does not currently have an automated capability to transfer the allowable percentage fee of costs to a central account at the Air Force Research Laboratory. This lack of capability, officials noted, creates a significant administrative burden related to charging these fees. Navy: In fiscal year 2017, Navy labs invested $7.3 million in lab infrastructure projects, compared to $32.9 million and $53.7 million at the Air Force and Army, respectively. Navy lab officials told us that they were restricted in their use of infrastructure funds available under the laboratory initiated research authority due to a lack of clear guidance as to whether and how to use this authority within the Capital Investment Program of the Navy Working Capital Fund. Army: The Army requires its labs to use a similar percentage of funds from two sources: (1) what it refers to as directly appropriated funds and (2) funds labs charge for customer activities. Some Army lab directors reported assessing a lower rate on customer funds than allowed so as not to drive customers away. The labs then generally charge a lower than desired rate on their directly appropriated funds, which further constrains the total funding available to them. GAO is making three recommendations to enhance DOD's use of laboratory initiated research authority, including that the Air Force assess potential accounting system improvements, the Navy clarify how labs can use the authority for infrastructure improvements, and the Army assess its policy to determine whether changes are needed to remove disincentives for labs to use the authority.

However, the report identifies several weaknesses in CMS's oversight, including inconsistent variance analyses for higher-matching-rate expenditures, a lack of comprehensive risk assessment, and an inadequate sampling methodology for Medicaid expansion populations. These issues may lead to undetected errors and improper federal funding. The report recommends that CMS conduct a national risk assessment, clarify guidance on variance analyses, and revise the sampling methodology to better target high-risk areas. HHS concurred with the recommendations, indicating that CMS will take steps to address these issues.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points. \n\nThe report is about CMS's oversight of Medicaid expenditures. States report their expenditures quarterly using the CMS-64 form, and there's a 2-year limit for adjusting past reports. CMS reviews these to ensure they're allowable and supported. They have quarterly reviews and FMRs. But there are issues: inconsistent variance analyses for higher-matching-rate expenditures, no comprehensive risk assessment, and a flawed sampling method for Medicaid expansion. These issues could lead to errors and improper funding. The recommendations are to do a risk assessment, clarify variance analysis guidance, and improve the sampling method. HHS agreed with the recommendations.\n\nNow, I need to condense this into a one-page summary. Let me structure it. Start with the main purpose: CMS's oversight of Medicaid expenditures. Mention the CMS-64 form, the 2-year filing limit, and the review processes (quarterly and FMRs). Then outline the weaknesses found: inconsistent variance analyses, lack of risk assessment, and inadequate sampling for expansion populations. Explain the implications—potential errors and improper funding. Then the recommendations: risk assessment, clarify guidance, revise sampling. Finally, mention HHS's concurrence.\n\nWait, the user wants a one-page summary, so I need to be concise. Avoid too much detail. Make sure to highlight the key points without getting bogged down in specifics. Also, check for any other important elements.

CMS is responsible for assuring that expenditures—reported quarterly by states—are consistent with Medicaid requirements and matched with the correct amount of federal funds. CMS's review of reported expenditures has become increasingly complex due to variation in states' Medicaid programs and an increasing number of different matching rates. GAO was asked to examine CMS's oversight of state-reported Medicaid expenditures. In this report, GAO examined how CMS assures that (1) expenditures are supported and consistent with requirements; and (2) the correct federal matching rates were applied to expenditures subject to a higher match. GAO also examined the financial impact of resolved errors. GAO reviewed documentation for the most recently completed quarterly reviews by 3 of CMS's 10 regional offices for six states that varied by Medicaid program expenditures and design. GAO also reviewed policies, procedures, and data on resolved errors; and interviewed CMS and state officials. GAO assessed CMS's oversight processes against federal standards for internal control. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which oversees Medicaid, has various review processes in place to assure that expenditures reported by states are supported and consistent with Medicaid requirements. The agency also has processes to review that the correct federal matching rates were applied to expenditures receiving a higher than standard federal matching rate, which can include certain types of services and populations. These processes collectively have had a considerable federal financial benefit, with CMS resolving errors that reduced federal spending by over $5.1 billion in fiscal years 2014 through 2017. However, GAO identified weaknesses in how CMS targets its resources to address risks when reviewing whether expenditures are supported and consistent with requirements. CMS devotes similar levels of staff resources to review expenditures despite differing levels of risk across states. For example, the number of staff reviewing California's expenditures—which represent 15 percent of federal Medicaid spending—is similar to the number reviewing Arkansas' expenditures, which represents 1 percent of federal Medicaid spending. CMS cancelled in-depth financial management reviews in 17 out of 51 instances over the last 5 years. These reviews target expenditures considered by CMS to be at risk of not meeting program requirements. CMS told GAO that resource constraints contributed to both weaknesses. However, the agency has not completed a comprehensive assessment of risk to (1) determine whether oversight resources are adequate and (2) focus on the most significant areas of risk. Absent such an assessment, CMS is missing an opportunity to identify errors in reported expenditures that could result in substantial savings to the Medicaid program. GAO also found limitations in CMS's processes for reviewing expenditures that receive a higher federal matching rate. Internal guidance for examining variances in these expenditures was unclear, and not all reviewers in the three CMS regional offices GAO reviewed were investigating significant variances in quarter-to-quarter expenditures. Review procedures for expenditures for individuals newly eligible for Medicaid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act were not tailored to different risk levels among states. For example, in its reviews of a sample of claims for this population, CMS reviewed claims for the same number of enrollees—30—in California as for Arkansas, even though California had 10 times the number of newly eligible enrollees as Arkansas. Without clear internal guidance and better targeting of risks in its review procedures for expenditures receiving higher matching rates, CMS may overpay states. GAO is making three recommendations, including that CMS improve its risk-based targeting of oversight efforts and resources, and clarify related internal guidance. The Department of Health and Human Services concurred with these recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5872}

It notes that the military has consistently backed these leaders, with the Muslim Brotherhood as the main opposition. The Arab Spring in 2011 led to Mubarak's ousting and Morsi's brief presidency, which ended with a military coup in 2013. The military, under Sisi, then took control, leading to a crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood and other dissenters. \n\nEconomically, Egypt has been undergoing reforms with IMF support, leading to growth but also high inflation and debt. The government has implemented austerity measures, and there's a focus on energy sectors like natural gas. However, there are concerns about inequality and the impact of economic policies on the population. \n\nInternationally, Egypt is trying to diversify its partnerships beyond the U.S., engaging with Gulf states, Israel, Russia, and France. The U.S. relationship is complex, with some aid withheld due to human rights issues. There's also mention of Egypt's role in regional conflicts, like Libya and the Sinai Peninsula, where they combat terrorism. \n\nThe report also discusses constitutional changes that could extend Sisi's presidency, human rights issues, and the treatment of Coptic Christians.

Egypt controls the Suez Canal, which is one of the world's most well-known maritime chokepoints, linking the Mediterranean and Red Seas. Egypt, with its population of more than 100 million people, is by far the most populous Arabic-speaking country. Although it may not play the same type of leading political or military role in the Arab world as it has in the past, Egypt may retain some \"soft power\" by virtue of its history, media, and culture. Cairo plays host both to the 22-member Arab League and Al Azhar University, which claims to be the oldest continuously operating university in the world and has symbolic importance as a leading source of Islamic scholarship. Additionally, Egypt's 1979 peace treaty with Israel remains one of the most significant diplomatic achievements for the promotion of Arab-Israeli peace. While people-to-people relations remain cold, the Israeli and Egyptian governments have increased their cooperation against Islamist militants and instability in the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip. Personnel moves and possible amendments to the Egyptian constitution highlight apparent efforts by President Sisi to consolidate power with the help of political allies, including colleagues from Egypt's security establishment. President Sisi has come under repeated international criticism for an ongoing government crackdown against various forms of political dissent and freedom of expression. The Egyptian government has defended its human rights record, asserting that the country is under pressure from terrorist groups seeking to destabilize Arab nation-states. The Trump Administration has tried to normalize ties with the Sisi government that were generally perceived as strained under President Obama. In January 2019, U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo delivered a major policy speech at the American University in Cairo, where he stated, \"And as we seek an even stronger partnership with Egypt, we encourage President Sisi to unleash the creative energy of Egypt's people, unfetter the economy, and promote a free and open exchange of ideas.\" The United States has provided significant military and economic assistance to Egypt since the late 1970s. Successive U.S. Administrations have justified aid to Egypt as an investment in regional stability, built primarily on long-running cooperation with the Egyptian military and on sustaining the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. All U.S. foreign aid to Egypt (or any recipient) is appropriated and authorized by Congress. Since 1946, the United States has provided Egypt with over $83 billion in bilateral foreign aid (calculated in historical dollars—not adjusted for inflation). Annual appropriations legislation includes several conditions governing the release of these funds. All U.S. military aid to Egypt finances the procurement of weapons systems and services from U.S. defense contractors. For FY2019, Congress has appropriated $1.4 billion in total bilateral assistance for Egypt, the same amount it provided in FY2018. For FY2020, the President is requesting a total of $1.382 billion in bilateral assistance for Egypt. Nearly all of the U.S. funds for Egypt come from the FMF account (military aid). In November 2018, the U.S. Defense Department notified Congress of a major $1 billion sale of defense equipment to Egypt, consisting of 10 AH-64E Apache Attack Helicopters, among other things. Beyond the United States, President Sisi has broadened Egypt's international base of support to include several key partners, including the Arab Gulf states, Israel, Russia, and France.

For such satellite systems, a single adversary attack or on-orbit failure can result in the loss of billions of dollars of investment and significant loss of vital capabilities. As DOD plans new space systems and addresses an increasingly contested space environment, it has the opportunity to consider different acquisition approaches. One such approach is to integrate a government sensor or payload onto a commercial host satellite. House Armed Services Committee report 115-200, accompanying a bill for the Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, included a provision for GAO to review DOD's use of commercially hosted payloads. This report (1) determines the extent to which DOD uses commercially hosted payloads and (2) describes and assesses factors that affect their use. GAO reviewed DOD policies, documentation, and planning documents, and interviewed a wide range of DOD and civil government officials, and commercial stakeholders. GAO and others have found that using commercial satellites to host government sensors or communications packages—called payloads—may be one way DOD can achieve on-orbit capability faster and more affordably. Using hosted payloads may also help facilitate a proliferation of payloads on orbit, making it more difficult for an adversary to defeat a capability. Since 2009, DOD has used three commercially hosted payloads, with three more missions planned or underway through 2022 (see figure below). DOD estimates that it has achieved cost savings of several hundred million dollars from using commercially hosted payloads to date, and expects to realize additional savings and deliver faster capabilities on orbit from planned missions. Cost savings can result from sharing development, launch, and ground system costs with the commercial host company. Among the factors that affect DOD's use of hosted payloads are a perception among some DOD officials that matching government payloads to commercial satellites is too difficult; and limited, fragmented knowledge on how to mitigate various challenges GAO found that further opportunities to use hosted payloads may emerge as DOD plans new and follow-on space systems in the coming years. However, DOD's knowledge on using hosted payloads is fragmented, in part because programs are not required to share information. In 2011, the Air Force created a Hosted Payload Office to provide expertise and other tools to facilitate matching government payloads with commercial hosts. However, GAO found that DOD programs using hosted payloads are not required and generally do not provide cost and technical data, or lessons learned, to the Hosted Payload Office, or another central office for analysis. Requiring programs that use hosted payloads agency-wide to provide this information to a central location would better position DOD to make informed decisions when considering acquisition approaches for upcoming space system designs. GAO recommends that DOD require programs using commercially hosted payloads to contribute resulting data to a central location. In implementing this recommendation, DOD should assess whether the Air Force's Hosted Payload Office is the appropriate location to collect and analyze the data.

Key findings include:\n\n1. **Technology Workforce Trends**: The technology sector, defined by industries with the highest concentration of technology workers, has seen significant growth in employment, with 7.5 million workers in 2015. However, women, Black, and Hispanic workers remain underrepresented compared to their representation in the general workforce. While the percentage of women in the technology workforce has remained flat, Black and Hispanic workers have not seen statistically significant increases in their representation, despite overall growth in the sector. Asian workers, however, have shown increased representation.\n\n2. **EEOC and OFCCP Oversight**: Both agencies are responsible for enforcing antidiscrimination laws and ensuring affirmative action compliance. EEOC faces challenges in analyzing industry-specific data due to incomplete industry code information in its database, limiting its ability to focus enforcement efforts. OFCCP, which oversees federal contractors, has faced delays in compliance reviews and has not fully assessed the causes of these delays. Additionally, OFCCP’s current approach to compliance evaluations, which is based on establishment-level reviews, may not adequately address the evolving nature of work in the technology sector, which often spans multiple locations.\n\n3. **Affirmative Action and Placement Goals**: OFCCP requires federal contractors to develop affirmative action programs (AAPs), but does not mandate the disaggregation of demographic data for specific minority groups when setting placement goals. This may hinder efforts to address underrepresentation in certain groups. The report recommends that OFCCP consider requiring more detailed placement goals and evaluate the effectiveness of alternative programs like the Functional Affirmative Action Program (FAAP).\n\n4. **Recommendations**: The report outlines six recommendations, including improving data collection for EEOC, analyzing OFCCP’s compliance processes, and enhancing placement goals for contractors. These steps aim to improve the effectiveness of oversight and promote diversity in the technology sector.\n\nThe report highlights the need for both agencies to refine their processes to better address systemic discrimination and support equal opportunity in the rapidly evolving technology industry.

EEOC provides federal oversight of nondiscrimination requirements by investigating charges of discrimination, and OFCCP enforces federal contractors' compliance with affirmative action requirements. GAO was asked to review workforce trends in the technology sector and federal oversight. This report examines (1) trends in the gender, racial, and ethnic composition of the technology sector workforce; and (2) EEOC and OFCCP oversight of technology companies' compliance with equal employment and affirmative action requirements. GAO analyzed workforce data from the American Community Survey for 2005-2015 and EEOC Employer Information Reports for 2007-2015, the latest data available during our analysis. GAO analyzed OFCCP data on compliance evaluations for fiscal years 2011-2016. GAO interviewed agency officials, researchers, and workforce, industry, and company representatives. The estimated percentage of minority technology workers increased from 2005 to 2015, but GAO found that no growth occurred for female and Black workers, whereas Asian and Hispanic workers made statistically significant increases (see figure). Further, female, Black, and Hispanic workers remain a smaller proportion of the technology workforce—mathematics, computing, and engineering occupations—compared to their representation in the general workforce. These groups have also been less represented among technology workers inside the technology sector than outside it. In contrast, Asian workers were more represented in these occupations than in the general workforce. Stakeholders and researchers GAO interviewed identified several factors that may have contributed to the lower representation of certain groups, such as fewer women and minorities graduating with technical degrees and company hiring and retention practices. Both the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) have taken steps to enforce equal employment and affirmative action requirements in the technology sector, but face limitations. While EEOC has identified barriers to recruitment and hiring in the technology sector as a strategic priority, when EEOC conducts investigations, it does not systematically record the type of industry, therefore limiting sector-related analyses to help focus its efforts. EEOC has plans to determine how to add missing industry codes but has not set a timeframe to do this. In addition, OFCCP's regulations may hinder its ability to enforce contractors' compliance because OFCCP directs contractors to set placement goals for all minorities as a group rather than for specific racial/ethnic groups. OFCCP also has not made changes to its establishment-based approach to selecting entities for review in decades, even though changes have occurred in how workplaces are structured. Without taking steps to address these issues, OFCCP may miss opportunities to hold contractors responsible for complying with affirmative action and nondiscrimination requirements. GAO makes 6 recommendations, including that EEOC develop a timeline to improve industry data collection and OFCCP take steps toward requiring more specific minority placement goals by contractors and assess key aspects of its selection approach.

The CHIP-IN Act authorizes up to five pilot projects, with the Omaha project being the first, which involves a $56 million VA contribution and a $30 million private donation. The program aims to test innovative approaches to VA's infrastructure challenges, potentially leading to cost and time savings through private-sector involvement.

The CHIP-IN Act includes a provision for GAO to report on donation agreements. This report (1) examines the extent to which the VA's pilot design aligns with leading practices and (2) discusses what VA has learned from the pilot to date. GAO reviewed VA documents, including plans for the pilot program, and visited the Omaha pilot project. GAO interviewed VA officials, the Omaha donor group, and three non-federal entities that responded to VA's request seeking donors. GAO compared implementation of VA's pilot to leading practices for pilot design, organizational transformation, and cross-functional teams. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is conducting a pilot program, called CHIP-IN, that allows VA to partner with non-federal entities and accept real property donations from them as a way to help address VA's infrastructure needs. Although VA signed its first project agreement under the program in April 2017, VA has not yet established a framework for effective design of the pilot program. Specifically, VA's pilot program design is not aligned with four of five leading practices for designing a well-developed and documented pilot program. VA has begun to implement one leading practice by improving its efforts to communicate with relevant stakeholders, such as including external stakeholders in key meetings. However, the VA offices involved have not agreed upon and documented clear, measurable objectives for the pilot program, which is a leading practice. Further, VA has not developed an assessment methodology or an evaluation plan that would help inform decisions about whether or how the pilot approach could be expanded. While VA officials said they intend to develop these items as tasks for the newly formed CHIP-IN steering committee, they have no timeline for doing so. Without clear objectives and assessment and evaluation plans, VA and Congress may have difficulty determining whether the pilot approach is an effective way to help address VA's infrastructure needs. To date, the CHIP-IN pilot suggests that donation partnerships could improve construction projects, but identifying donors and establishing a team for the pilot program have presented challenges. Officials from VA and the donor group for the first pilot project—an ambulatory care center in Omaha, Nebraska—said they are completing the project faster than if it had been a standard federal construction project, while achieving potential cost savings by using private sector practices. However, VA officials said it is challenging to find partners to make large donations with no financial return, and VA's lack of marketing and philanthropic development experience exacerbates that challenge. VA and the donor group agreed that a dedicated team of individuals with relevant expertise could facilitate the pilot's implementation. The new CHIP-IN steering committee could serve this purpose, but it lacks documented roles and responsibilities. Establishing a team with clear roles and responsibilities and identifying both available and needed staff resources could assist VA in partnering with additional donors and creating new opportunities to meet veterans' needs.

{"pred": " The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) plays a central role in addressing lead paint hazards in federally-assisted housing, working alongside the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). HUD is responsible for implementing regulations such as the Lead Disclosure Rule and the Lead Safe Housing Rule, which require property owners and landlords to disclose lead hazards and take action when children have elevated blood lead levels. The EPA sets federal standards for lead in paint, soil, and dust, while CDC establishes the blood lead reference value, which was lowered to 5 micrograms per deciliter in 2012. HUD has aligned its standards with CDC’s to better protect children from lead exposure. HUD’s lead grant programs, including the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control Grant and the Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration Grant, provide funding to state and local jurisdictions to address lead hazards. These programs require matching funds and prioritize areas with high lead risk, such as older housing and high poverty rates. However, HUD faces challenges in documenting and evaluating its grant processes, ensuring consistent scoring of applications, and targeting resources effectively. The agency also struggles with monitoring compliance by public housing authorities (PHAs), as some PHAs may falsely certify compliance, and HUD lacks comprehensive data for the voucher program. HUD has taken steps to improve compliance monitoring, such as using databases to track lead hazards and elevated blood lead levels, but more robust enforcement mechanisms are needed. Additionally, HUD’s inspection standards for voucher units are less stringent than for public housing, potentially leaving children in voucher units more vulnerable to lead exposure. The report recommends that HUD improve documentation of grant processes, develop time frames for identifying at-risk areas, strengthen compliance monitoring, and request legislative authority to adopt more rigorous inspection standards for voucher units. HUD also needs to establish comprehensive performance goals, evaluate the effectiveness of its regulations, and report on its lead safety efforts to ensure accountability and transparency. Overall, while HUD has made progress in addressing lead hazards, there are opportunities to enhance its programs to better protect children in low-income housing from the long-term health effects of lead exposure.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report about HUD's efforts to address lead paint hazards. Let me start by understanding the key points.

HUD awards grants to state and local governments to reduce lead paint hazards in housing and oversees compliance with lead paint regulations in its rental assistance programs. The 2017 Consolidated Appropriations Act, Joint Explanatory Statement, includes a provision that GAO review HUD’s efforts to address lead paint hazards. This report examines HUD’s efforts to (1) incorporate statutory requirements and other relevant federal standards in its lead grant programs, (2) monitor and enforce compliance with lead paint regulations in its rental assistance programs, (3) adopt federal health guidelines and environmental standards for its lead grant and rental assistance programs, and (4) measure and report on the performance of its lead efforts. GAO reviewed HUD documents and data related to its grant programs, compliance efforts, performance measures, and reporting. GAO also interviewed HUD staff and some grantees. The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) lead grant and rental assistance programs have taken steps to address lead paint hazards, but opportunities exist for improvement. For example, in 2016, HUD began using new tools to monitor how public housing agencies comply with lead paint regulations. However, HUD could further improve efforts in the following areas: Lead grant programs. While its recent grant award processes incorporate statutory requirements on applicant eligibility and selection criteria, HUD has not fully documented or evaluated these processes. For example, HUD’s guidance is not sufficiently detailed to ensure consistent and appropriate grant award decisions. Better documentation and evaluation of HUD’s grant program processes could help ensure that lead grants reach areas at risk of lead paint hazards. Further, HUD has not developed specific time frames for using available local-level data to better identify areas of the country at risk for lead paint hazards, which could help HUD target its limited resources. Oversight. HUD does not have a plan to mitigate and address risks related to noncompliance with lead paint regulations by public housing agencies. We identified several limitations with HUD’s monitoring efforts, including reliance on public housing agencies’ self-certifying compliance with lead paint regulations and challenges identifying children with elevated blood lead levels. Additionally, HUD lacks detailed procedures for addressing noncompliance consistently and in a timely manner. Developing a plan and detailed procedures to address noncompliance with lead paint regulations could strengthen HUD’s oversight of public housing agencies. Inspections. The lead inspection standard for the Housing Choice Voucher program is less strict than that of the public housing program. By requesting and obtaining statutory authority to amend the standard for the voucher program, HUD would be positioned to take steps to better protect children in voucher units from lead exposure as indicated by analysis of benefits and costs. Performance assessment and reporting. HUD lacks comprehensive goals and performance measures for its lead reduction efforts. In addition, it has not complied with annual statutory reporting requirements, last reporting as required on its lead efforts in 1997. Without better performance assessment and reporting, HUD cannot fully assess the effectiveness of its lead efforts. GAO makes nine recommendations to HUD including to improve lead grant program and compliance monitoring processes, request authority to amend its lead inspection standard in the voucher program, and take additional steps to report on progress. HUD generally agreed with eight of the recommendations. HUD disagreed that it should request authority to use a specific, stricter inspection standard.

These goals are to be reviewed regularly, with data-driven reviews and strategic assessments to track progress. The report highlights that while OMB and agencies have made progress in implementing GPRAMA, significant challenges remain. Key areas of focus include improving coordination to reduce fragmentation, overlap, and duplication among federal programs, enhancing the use of performance information in decision-making, and ensuring transparency through platforms like Performance.gov. Despite some improvements, the report notes that the use of performance information has not significantly increased, and many recommendations related to program inventories and tax expenditures remain unaddressed. The report also discusses the suspension of quarterly updates on CAP and APG progress due to a presidential transition, which has affected transparency. OMB is expected to resume these efforts in 2018. The findings suggest that while GPRAMA provides a framework for better governance, continued implementation and focus on specific recommendations are necessary to achieve meaningful improvements in federal performance and accountability. The report concludes with four recommendations for OMB to enhance transparency, improve program inventory implementation, and expand data-driven reviews to drive better results. Overall, the report underscores the importance of sustained effort and collaboration to fully realize the potential of GPRAMA in addressing key governance challenges. (Word count: 250)\nThe Government Performance and Results Act Modernization Act (GPRAMA) aims to enhance federal performance and accountability by addressing longstanding management and results challenges. GPRAMA establishes cross-agency priority (CAP) goals, agency priority goals (APGs), and strategic objectives to focus on outcomes and improve interagency collaboration. These goals are reviewed regularly through data-driven reviews and strategic assessments. While OMB and agencies have made progress in implementing GPRAMA, significant challenges persist. Key areas include reducing fragmentation, overlap, and duplication among federal programs, improving the use of performance information in decision-making, and ensuring transparency through platforms like Performance.gov. Despite some improvements, the report notes that performance information use has not significantly increased, and many recommendations related to program inventories and tax expenditures remain unaddressed. The suspension of quarterly updates on CAP and APG progress due to a presidential transition has affected transparency. OMB is expected to resume these efforts in 2018. The", "answers": ["Full implementation of GPRAMA could facilitate efforts to reform the federal government and make it more effective. GPRAMA includes a provision for GAO to review the act's implementation. This report assesses how GPRAMA implementation has affected the federal government's progress in resolving key governance challenges in (1) addressing cross-cutting issues, (2) ensuring performance information is useful and used, (3) aligning daily operations with results, and (4) building a more transparent and open government. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed statutory requirements, OMB guidance, and GAO's recent work related to GPRAMA implementation and the key governance challenges. GAO also interviewed OMB staff and surveyed a stratified random sample of 4,395 federal managers from 24 agencies on various performance and management topics. With a 67 percent response rate, the survey results are generalizable to the government-wide population of managers. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and agencies have made some progress in more fully implementing the GPRA Modernization Act (GPRAMA), but GAO's work and 2017 survey of federal managers highlight numerous areas where improvements are needed. Cross-cutting issues: Various GPRAMA provisions are aimed at addressing cross-cutting issues, such as cross-agency and agency priority goals and related data-driven reviews of progress towards those goals. To ensure alignment with the current administration's priorities, OMB's 2017 guidance removed the priority status of those goals, which stopped quarterly data-driven reviews and related public progress reports until new goals are published. OMB plans to resume implementation of these provisions in February 2018. GPRAMA also requires OMB and agencies to implement an inventory of federal programs, which could help decision makers better identify and manage fragmentation, overlap, and duplication. OMB and agencies implemented the inventory once, in May 2013. In October 2014, GAO found several issues limited the usefulness of that inventory. Since then, OMB has postponed updating the inventory, citing among other reasons the passage of subsequent laws. OMB has yet to develop a systematic approach for resuming implementation of the inventory and specific time frames for doing so. A systematic approach to developing the inventory could help ensure it provides useful information for decision makers and the public. Performance information: Survey results show federal managers generally reported no improvements in their use of performance information in decision making for various management activities, or practices that can enhance such use, since GAO's 2013 survey. For example, the use of performance information to streamline programs to reduce duplicative activities (an estimated 33 percent in 2017) is statistically significantly lower relative to 2013 (44 percent). In contrast, managers who were familiar with and whose programs were subject to quarterly data-driven reviews reported that those reviews were used to make progress toward agency priority goals. Identifying and sharing practices to expand the use of such reviews—for other performance goals and at lower levels within agencies—could lead to increased use of performance information. Daily operations: Agencies have made progress in developing results-oriented cultures but need to take additional actions. GAO's past work found that high-performing organizations use performance management systems to help individuals connect their daily activities to organizational goals. In 2017, about half of federal managers reported using performance information when setting expectations with employees (no change from GAO's last survey in 2013). Transparent and open government: GAO's past work identified a number of needed improvements to Performance.gov, the central government-wide website required by GPRAMA. The site is to provide quarterly updates on priority goals in effect through September 2017, but those updates stopped in December 2016. According to OMB, the existing information for cross-agency priority goals is the final update, and agencies should publish final updates on their priority goals in annual performance reports. Performance.gov does not provide users with this information, thereby limiting the transparency and accessibility of those results. In addition to following through on plans to resume implementation of key GPRAMA provisions, GAO recommends that OMB (1) consider a systematic approach to developing the program inventory, (2) revise guidance to provide specific time frames for inventory implementation, (3) identify and share practices for expanding the use of data-driven reviews, and (4) update Performance.gov to explain that reporting on priority goals was suspended and provide the location of final progress updates.

{"pred": " The Colorado River Basin, spanning over 246,000 square miles and flowing through seven U.S. states and Mexico, is a critical water source for agriculture, municipal, and industrial uses, as well as power generation and recreation. Managed primarily by the Bureau of Reclamation under federal law, the basin's water is allocated through a complex legal framework known as the Law of the River, which includes the Colorado River Compact of 1922 and subsequent agreements. The compact divided the river into Upper and Lower Basins, with the Lower Basin receiving additional water rights and the federal government playing a central role in managing water distribution. The basin faces significant challenges due to prolonged drought, climate change, and increasing water demand, with natural flows declining from an average of 14.8 million acre-feet annually to 12.4 million acre-feet since 2000. Storage facilities, such as Lake Mead and Lake Powell, are crucial for managing water supply, but their levels have dropped dramatically, raising concerns about future water availability. The 2007 Interim Guidelines and subsequent Drought Contingency Plans (DCPs) aim to address these issues by implementing water conservation measures, curtailments, and storage strategies. Congress plays a vital role in funding and overseeing these efforts, including environmental protection programs and infrastructure projects. The report highlights the need for continued collaboration among federal, state, and tribal stakeholders to ensure sustainable water management in the face of growing demand and environmental pressures.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this detailed report about the Colorado River Basin. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nFirst, the report talks about the Colorado River's vast area, the states it flows through, and the federal role in managing its waters. The Bureau of Reclamation is a big part of that management, especially in the Lower Basin. The river is used for agriculture, municipal, and industrial purposes, and it's also important for power, wildlife, and recreation. The report mentions that 70% of the water is used for irrigation on 5.5 million acres, and 40 million people rely on it for M&I uses. There's a lot of trans-basin diversions, like to cities in Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and California.\n\nThen there's the history of the Colorado River Compact of 1922, which divided the river into Upper and Lower Basins. The Lower Basin", "answers": ["The Colorado River Basin covers more than 246,000 square miles in seven U.S. states (Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and California) and Mexico. Pursuant to federal law, the Bureau of Reclamation (part of the Department of the Interior) manages much of the basin's water supplies. Colorado River water is used primarily for agricultural irrigation and municipal and industrial (M&I) uses, but it also is important for power production, fish and wildlife, and recreational uses. In recent years, consumptive uses of Colorado River water have exceeded natural flows. This causes an imbalance in the basin's available supplies and competing demands. A drought in the basin dating to 2000 has raised the prospect of water delivery curtailments and decreased hydropower production, among other things. In the future, observers expect that increasing demand for supplies, coupled with the effects of climate change, will further increase the strain on the basin's limited water supplies. River Management The Law of the River is the commonly used shorthand for the multiple laws, court decisions, and other documents governing Colorado River operations. The foundational document of the Law of the River is the Colorado River Compact of 1922. Pursuant to the compact, the basin states established a framework to apportion the water supplies between the Upper and Lower Basins of the Colorado River, with the dividing line between the two basins at Lee Ferry, AZ (near the Utah border). The Upper and Lower Basins each were allocated 7.5 million acre-feet (MAF) annually under the Colorado River Compact; an additional 1.5 MAF in annual flows was made available to Mexico under a 1944 treaty. Future agreements and court decisions addressed numerous other issues (including intrastate allocations of flows), and subsequent federal legislation provided authority and funding for federal facilities that allowed users to develop their allocations. A Supreme Court ruling also confirmed that Congress designated the Secretary of the Interior as the water master for the Lower Basin, a role in which the federal government manages the delivery of all water below Hoover Dam. Reclamation and basin stakeholders closely track the status of two large reservoirs—Lake Powell in the Upper Basin and Lake Mead in the Lower Basin—as an indicator of basin storage conditions. Under recent guidelines, dam releases from these facilities are tied to specific water storage levels. For Lake Mead, the first tier of \"shortage,\" under which Arizona's and Nevada's allocations would be decreased, would be triggered if Lake Mead's January 1 elevation is expected to fall below 1,075 feet above mean sea level. As of early 2019, Reclamation projected that there was a 69% chance of a shortage condition at Lake Mead in 2020; there was also a lesser chance of Lake Powell reaching critically low levels. Improved hydrology in early 2019 may decrease the chances of shortage in the immediate future. Drought Contingency Plans Despite previous efforts to alleviate future shortages, the basin's hydrological outlook has generally worsened in recent years. After several years of negotiations, in early 2019 Reclamation and the basin states transmitted to Congress additional plans to alleviate stress on basin water supplies. These plans, known as the drought contingency plans (DCPs) for the Upper and Lower Basins, were authorized by Congress in April 2019 in the Colorado River Drought Contingency Plan Authorization Act (P.L. 116-14). The DCPs among other things obligate Lower Basin states to additional water supply cutbacks at specified storage levels (i.e., cutbacks beyond previous curtailment plans), commit Reclamation to additional water conservation efforts, and coordinate Upper Basin operations to protect Lake Powell storage levels and hydropower generation. Congressional Role Congress plays a multifaceted role in federal management of the Colorado River basin. Congress funds and oversees management of basin facilities, including operations and programs to protect and restore endangered species. It has also enacted and continues to consider Indian water rights settlements involving Colorado River waters and development of new water storage facilities in the basin. In addition, Congress has approved funding to mitigate water shortages and conserve basin water supplies and has enacted new authorities to combat drought and its effects on basin water users (i.e., the DCPs and other related efforts)."], "all_classes": null, "length": 7367}

The report recommends that OMB make more disaggregated data available, describe data limitations, and ensure regular reviews of fee designations. It also suggests that OMB should update its guidance to clarify how budget authority is reported net of offsetting collections. The report concludes that while government-wide reporting of fees, fines, and penalties could enhance transparency and oversight, it would require significant resources and coordination.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report. Let me start by understanding the main points. The report is about the federal government's collections from fees, fines, and penalties, and how the data is managed and reported. \n\nFirst, the report mentions that in fiscal year 2017, the U.S. government received over $350 billion from these sources. But there's no comprehensive, publicly available data on specific fees, fines, and penalties. OMB and Treasury have some aggregated data, but they can't break it down to individual programs or agencies. The MAX database has more detailed info, but it's not public. \n\nThe report also talks about the different types of collections: offsetting collections, offsetting receipts, and governmental receipts. Each has different reporting requirements and oversight implications. For example, offsetting collections don't need annual appropriations, which gives agencies more flexibility. But this also means Congress has less control. \n\nThere's a mention of the DATA Act and GPRAMA, which aim to improve transparency. However, the current data sources don't fully meet the needs for oversight. The report points out that OMB's data might include inaccuracies because they use a 50% threshold to label accounts as fees, which could lead to over or underestimation. \n\nThe recommendations from the report include making more", "answers": ["Congress has authorized federal agencies to collect hundreds of billions of dollars annually in fees, fines, and penalties. These collections can fund a variety of programs, including programs related to national security, and the protection of natural resources. Data on collections are important for congressional oversight and to provide transparency in agencies' use of federal resources. GAO was asked to review the availability of government-wide data on fees, fines, and penalties. This report examines (1) the extent to which data on collections of fees, fines, and penalties are publically available and useful for the purpose of congressional oversight; and (2) the benefits and challenges to government-wide reporting of fees, fines, and penalties. GAO assessed government-wide fee, fine, and penalty data against criteria for availability and usefulness based on multiple sources, including prior GAO work and input from staff of selected congressional committees. GAO interviewed OMB staff, Treasury officials, and representatives of organizations with expertise in federal budget issues and reviewed prior GAO work to identify benefits and challenges of reporting these data. There are no comprehensive, government-wide data at the level of detail that identifies specific fees, fines, or penalties. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) report data that include these collections at the budget account level, which generally covers a set of agency activities or programs. OMB and Treasury also report some summary data for budgeting and financial management purposes. In the Budget of the U.S. Government , for example, OMB data showed government-wide fees totaled just over $335 billion in fiscal year 2017. These reports, however, are not designed to inventory or analyze fee, fine, or penalty collections and have significant limitations for that purpose. Although OMB collects more disaggregated data on fees, fines, and penalties, it does not make the data publicly available. OMB uses the disaggregated data in its OMB MAX database—such as the agency and account—to compile reported totals, such as the government-wide fees total in the Budget of the U.S. Government . Until OMB makes more disaggregated data publicly available, Congress has limited information on collections by agency to inform oversight and decision-making. OMB's government-wide total of fees includes collections that are not fees and excludes some fee collections. The total includes all collections for accounts in which fees make up at least half of the account's collections and excludes all others. OMB does not direct agencies to regularly review and update the accounts included in the total. Therefore, if accounts' makeups change such that fee collections drop below, or rise above, the 50 percent threshold, accounts may have incorrect fee designations and the total may be inaccurate. Further, OMB does not disclose the limitation that the total may exclude some fees and include other collections that are not fees. As a result, some users of the data are likely unaware of the potential for the total fees to be overestimated or underestimated. Further, no source of government-wide data consistently reports data elements on fees, fines, and penalties that could help inform congressional oversight. Generally, congressional staff told us that additional data, such as amounts of specific penalties, would increase transparency and facilitate oversight. These data could help Congress identify trends in collections and significant changes that could be an indication of an agency's performance. While reporting government-wide fee, fine, and penalty data provides benefits, there are trade-offs in terms of the time and federal resources it would take to develop and implement a process for agencies to report these data. The level of federal investment would vary depending on factors, such as the number of data elements included and the level of detail reported. Developing a comprehensive and accessible data source would provide greater benefits, but would likely be resource intensive. Alternatively, incorporating a small number of data elements that Congress identifies as most useful for oversight into ongoing government-wide reporting efforts could incrementally improve transparency and information for oversight and decision-making, with fewer resources.

While SFSP meal participation has increased from 113 million to 149 million meals between fiscal years 2007 and 2016, the program faces challenges in accurately estimating children’s participation due to inconsistent methods of calculating average daily attendance (ADA), which relies on July data and does not account for variations in meal site operations and months with higher meal counts. \n\nThe report highlights that SFSP meals must meet federal nutritional standards and are reimbursed based on meal type and site type.

In the last decade, federal expenditures for SFSP have increased as the program has expanded, according to USDA data. GAO was asked to review the SFSP. This report examines (1) what is known about SFSP participation, (2) other programs that help feed low-income children over the summer, and (3) challenges, if any, in providing summer meals to children and the extent to which USDA provides assistance to address these challenges. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed USDA's SFSP data for fiscal years 2007 through 2016; surveyed state agencies responsible for administering the SFSP in 50 states and the District of Columbia; visited a nongeneralizable group of 3 states and 30 meal sites, selected based on Census data on child poverty rates and urban and rural locations; analyzed meal site data from the 3 states; and interviewed USDA, state and national organization officials, and SFSP providers, including sponsors and site operators. Nationwide, the total number of meals served to children in low-income areas through the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) increased from 113 to 149 million (about 32 percent) from fiscal year 2007 through 2016. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) directs states to use the number of meals served, along with other data, to estimate the number of children participating in the SFSP. However, participation estimates have been calculated inconsistently from state to state and year to year. In 2017, USDA took steps to improve the consistency of participation estimates, noting they are critical for informing program implementation and strategic planning. However, GAO determined that the method USDA directs states to use will continue to provide unreliable estimates of participation, hindering USDA's ability to use them for these purposes. Other federal and nonfederal programs help feed low-income children over the summer to some extent, according to states GAO surveyed and SFSP providers and others GAO interviewed. For example, in July 2016, USDA data indicate about 26 million meals were served through a separate federal program that allows school meal providers to serve summer meals. Some children also received summer meals through nonfederal programs operated by faith-based organizations and foodbanks, though GAO's state survey and interviews with providers and national organizations indicate the reach of such efforts is limited. States and SFSP providers reported challenges with meal sites, participation, and program administration; USDA has taken steps to address these areas. Specifically, in GAO's survey, a majority of states reported challenges with availability and awareness of meal sites, as well as limited program participation and administrative capacity. National, state, and local officials have taken steps to address these issues, such as increasing outreach and offering activities to attract participation. In addition, 17 states in GAO's survey and providers in the states GAO visited reported a challenge with ensuring meal sites are in safe locations. To address this safety issue, USDA has granted some states and sponsors flexibility from the requirement that children consume meals on-site. However, USDA has not broadly communicated the circumstances it considers when granting this flexibility. Further, some states and sponsors that have requested this flexibility reported difficulty obtaining data to show these circumstances exist, hampering their ability to ensure safe meal delivery.

The main topics seem to be the size and growth of Medicare, the challenges with fraud, improper payments, and the framework CMS is using to manage these risks. \n\nFirst, the report mentions that Medicare is the largest CMS program, costing $702 billion in 2017, and projected to reach $1.5 trillion by 2028. Fraud is a significant issue, but there are no reliable estimates of its extent. The report also talks about the Fraud Risk Framework, which is a set of guidelines for managing fraud risks. CMS has some initiatives in place, like the Center for Program Integrity (CPI), but there are gaps in their approach.\n\nThe report points out that CMS hasn't conducted a comprehensive fraud risk assessment for Medicare as a whole. They focus on specific areas like Medicare FFS (Fee-for-Service) but haven't assessed all potential risks. The Fraud Risk Framework has four components: commit, assess, design and implement, evaluate and adapt. CMS has done some of these, like committing to fraud prevention through CPI, but they're missing the assessment and strategy development parts.\n\nThere's also a mention of training. CMS provides training for stakeholders but not all employees, which is a concern. The report recommends that CMS should implement regular fraud-awareness training for all employees. Additionally, they need to conduct a fraud risk assessment and develop a risk-based antifraud strategy aligned with the Fraud Risk Framework. \n\nThe report also highlights that CMS has monitoring and evaluation mechanisms but they could be better integrated into a strategy. The GAO has made several recommendations, and CMS is still working on implementing them. The summary needs to capture all these points concisely, highlighting the main issues and recommendations without getting too detailed.\n\nI should structure the summary with an introduction about Medicare's size and the fraud issue, then discuss CMS's current efforts, the gaps in their approach, the Fraud Risk Framework, the recommendations, and the status of those recommendations.

Further, about $1.4 billion was returned to Medicare Trust Funds in fiscal year 2017 as a result of recoveries, fines, and asset forfeitures. In December 2017, GAO issued a report examining how CMS managed its fraud risks overall and particularly the extent to which its efforts in the Medicare and Medicaid programs aligned with GAO's Framework. This testimony, based on that report, discusses the extent to which CMS's management of fraud risks in Medicare aligns with the Framework. For the report, GAO reviewed CMS policies and interviewed officials and external stakeholders. In its December 2017 report, GAO found that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) antifraud efforts for Medicare partially align with GAO's 2015 A Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs (Framework). The Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015 required OMB to incorporate leading practices identified in this Framework in its guidance to agencies on addressing fraud risks. Consistent with the Framework, GAO determined that CMS had demonstrated commitment to combating fraud by creating a dedicated entity to lead antifraud efforts; the Center for Program Integrity (CPI) serves as this entity for fraud, waste, and abuse issues in Medicare. CMS also promoted an antifraud culture by, for example, coordinating with internal stakeholders to incorporate antifraud features into new program design. To increase awareness of fraud risks in Medicare, CMS offered and required training for stakeholder groups such as providers of medical services, but it did not offer or require similar fraud-awareness training for most of its workforce. CMS took some steps to identify fraud risks in Medicare; however, it had not conducted a fraud risk assessment or designed and implemented a risk-based antifraud strategy for Medicare as defined in the Framework. CMS identified fraud risks through control activities that target areas the agency designated as higher risk within Medicare, including specific provider types, such as home health agencies. Building on earlier steps and conducting a fraud risk assessment, consistent with the Framework, would provide the detailed information and insights needed to create a fraud risk profile, which, in turn, is the basis for creating an antifraud strategy. CMS established monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for its program-integrity control activities that, if aligned with an antifraud strategy, could enhance the effectiveness of fraud risk management in Medicare. For example, CMS used return-on-investment and savings estimates to measure the effectiveness of its Medicare program-integrity activities. In developing an antifraud strategy, consistent with the Framework, CMS could include plans for refining and building on existing methods such as return-on-investment, to evaluate the effectiveness of all of its antifraud efforts. In its December 2017 report, GAO made three recommendations, namely that CMS (1) require and provide fraud-awareness training to its employees; (2) conduct fraud risk assessments; and (3) create an antifraud strategy for Medicare, including an approach for evaluation. The Department of Health and Human Services agreed with these recommendations and reportedly is evaluating options to implement them. Accordingly, the recommendations remain open."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5746}
{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report about the Social Security Administration's (SSA) IT management and challenges. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report starts by explaining SSA's mission and the three main programs they administer: Old-Age and Survivors Insurance, Disability Insurance, and Supplemental Security Income. It gives the 2019 budget figures for each program, which is important context for the agency's operations. Then it shifts focus to SSA's reliance on IT systems, mentioning the volume of transactions they handle daily and the challenges in managing their IT infrastructure.\n\nThe report highlights that SSA has faced long-standing IT management issues, including weaknesses in system development, governance, and strategic planning. There have been multiple reports pointing out these problems, leading to recommendations for improvement. The agency has taken steps to address some of these issues, like data center consolidation, incremental development, IT acquisitions, and software licenses. However, there are still gaps, especially regarding the role of the CIO in key areas like strategic planning, workforce management, budgeting, investment management, and information security.\n\nThe report also mentions FITARA (Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act) and Executive Order 13833, which aim to improve IT management by enhancing CIO authority and responsibilities. SSA has made progress in some areas, such as implementing recommendations for data center optimization and incremental development, but not all. The CIO's role in certain aspects remains underdeveloped, which is a critical area needing attention.\n\nI need to condense all this into a one-page summary. Let me structure it with an introduction about SSA's mission and programs, then move into IT challenges, the steps taken to improve, the remaining issues, and the conclusion about the importance of effective IT management. I should mention the key recommendations and the agency's responses, highlighting both progress and ongoing challenges. Also, include the impact of FITARA and the executive order on SSA's IT management. Make sure to keep it concise, double-spaced, with 12-point font and 1-inch margins. Avoid jargon where possible, but since it's a summary of a government report, some technical terms are necessary. Check for clarity and flow, ensuring each paragraph transitions smoothly. Let me start drafting the summary now.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of the report. Let me start", "answers": ["SSA delivers services that touch the lives of almost every American, and relies heavily on IT resources to do so. Its systems support a range of activities, such as processing Disability Insurance payments, to calculating and withholding Medicare premiums, and issuing Social Security numbers and cards. For fiscal year 2018, the agency planned to spend approximately $1.6 billion on IT. GAO has previously reported that federal IT projects have often failed, in part, due to a lack of oversight and governance. Given the challenges that federal agencies, including SSA, have encountered in managing IT acquisitions, Congress and the administration have taken steps to improve federal IT, including enacting federal IT acquisition reform legislation and issuing related guidance. This statement summarizes GAO's previously reported findings regarding SSA's management of IT acquisitions and operations. In developing this testimony, GAO summarized findings from its reports issued in 2011 through 2018, and information on SSA's actions in response to GAO's recommendations. The Social Security Administration (SSA) has improved its management of information technology (IT) acquisitions and operations by addressing 14 of the 15 recommendations that GAO has made to the agency. For example, Incremental development . The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has emphasized the need for agencies to deliver IT investments in smaller increments to reduce risk and deliver capabilities more quickly. In November 2017, GAO reported that agencies, including SSA, needed to improve their certification of incremental development. As a result, GAO recommended that SSA's CIO (1) report incremental development information accurately, and (2) update its incremental development policy and processes. SSA implemented both recommendations. Software licenses . Effective management of software licenses can help avoid purchasing too many licenses that result in unused software. In May 2014, GAO reported that most agencies, including SSA, lacked comprehensive software license policies. As a result, GAO made six recommendations to SSA, to include developing a comprehensive software licenses policy and inventory. SSA implemented all six recommendations. However, SSA's IT management policies have not fully addressed the role of its CIO. Various laws and related guidance assign IT management responsibilities to CIOs in six key areas. In August 2018, GAO reported that SSA had fully addressed the role of the CIO in one of the six areas (see table). Specifically, SSA's policies fully addressed the CIO's role in the IT leadership and accountability area by requiring the CIO to report directly to the agency head, among other things. In contrast, SSA's policies did not address or minimally addressed the IT workforce and IT strategic planning areas. For example, SSA's policies did not include requirements for the CIO to annually assess the extent to which personnel meet IT management skill requirements or to measure how well IT supports agency programs. GAO recommended that SSA address the weaknesses in the remaining five key areas. SSA agreed with GAO's recommendation and stated that the agency plans to implement the recommendation by the end of this month. GAO has made 15 recommendations to SSA to improve its management of IT acquisitions and operations from 2011 through 2018, and 1 recommendation to improve its CIO policies. While SSA has implemented nearly all of them, it would be better positioned to overcome longstanding IT management challenges when it addresses the CIO's role in its policies."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3733}
{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report about federal user fees. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report talks about how the federal government uses various fees and charges to collect public funds, instead of just taxes. It explains that these fees come from different sources: some are for services like national parks, others are related to regulatory activities, and some are internal transactions between government agencies. The report mentions that user fees can be a significant portion of some agencies' budgets, like the SEC or the FDA, but for others, they're a small part. \n\nIt also discusses the advantages of user fees, such as being voluntary and connecting the cost to those who benefit, which can promote fairness and efficiency. However, there are drawbacks, like the potential for political resistance when raising taxes versus fees, and the fact that fees can fluctuate with economic conditions. There's also a mention of concerns about bypassing congressional oversight and diluting Congress's power of the purse.\n\nThe report goes into detail about how user fees are defined by different agencies, like the GAO and OMB, and how they're categorized in budget documents. It notes that the federal government doesn't account for asset losses when selling resources, which is different from private accounting. There's a lot about offsetting collections and receipts, and how they're treated in budget scoring, like the Budget Control Act of 2011. \n\nThe economic principles like the benefit principle and Pigou taxation are discussed, linking fees to the benefits received. Examples include passport fees and park entry fees. The report also touches on the challenges of setting fees that match incremental costs, especially with unpredictable demand. There are mentions of agencies like the FDA and PTO relying on fees, which might influence their priorities. \n\nThere's a section about the potential for user fees to affect public interest versus private interests, like the Patent Office's fees possibly leading to approving invalid patents. The report also discusses the administrative challenges, such as high collection costs relative to service costs, and examples like PACER fees. \n\nThe summary also covers the debate over privatizing services, the role of Congress in overseeing fees, and the need for better data and transparency. It mentions legislative proposals to change how fees are handled, like depositing them into the Treasury General Fund. The conclusion emphasizes the importance of balancing efficiency, equity, and oversight when using user fees", "answers": ["The federal government collects various fees from businesses and households. Choosing to raise public funds via user fees, as opposed to other means such as taxes, has important administrative and economic consequences. Many fees stem from \"business-like activities,\" in which the government provides a service or benefit in return for payment. For example, many national parks charge entry fees, which then help fund maintenance projects. Such fees and charges that result from voluntary choices, such as entering a national park, are distinguished from taxes—which stem from the government's sovereign power to compel payments. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) defines a user fee as a \"fee assessed to users for goods or services provided by the federal government. User fees generally apply to federal programs or activities that provide special benefits to identifiable recipients above and beyond what is normally available to the public.\" User fees and charges have several advantages as a means of financing public activities. They are voluntary, they connect the burden of financing activities to those who directly benefit from them, and can help decentralize decisionmaking by bypassing centralized allocation of resources. Some have expressed concerns that user fee arrangements may bypass regular congressional scrutiny and dilute Congress's power of the purse. Collections of fees and charges may also be more sensitive to economic fluctuations, which could complicate financing of programs dependent on those revenue streams. Many user fees or charges are classified as offsetting collections, which are deposited into expenditure accounts. Offsetting collections can be used to offset agency spending and typically require no further congressional approval to use. Other fees and charges are classified as offsetting receipts, which are collected into revenue accounts and typically require congressional authorization to be spent. User fees and charges can be classified as discretionary or mandatory spending, depending on how they are legally authorized. The levels and administration of some fees are specified in detailed statutory text, while other fees are created under broader agency authorities. Certain agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have increased their reliance on user fees in past decades. Some critics have raised concerns that increased reliance on user fees could shift incentives facing those agencies. Some legislative proposals, such as H.R. 850 introduced in the 115th Congress, would limit or eliminate most exceptions and require most fees and charges to be deposited in the U.S. Treasury General Fund. Congress could fund agencies and activities now funded in whole or in part via user fees directly through the annual appropriations process. Such proposals would mark a departure from past practice. Statutory text governing many fees has evolved over many years and involves substantive policy decisions, often related to the industry or programmatic concerns. A general change in funding from user fees and charges to annual appropriations would likely shift the division of responsibilities between authorizing committees and appropriations committees. Congress may also enhance its oversight of agencies reliant on user fees by requiring more timely and detailed financial reports as well as more precise and systematic explanations of linkages between those fees and associated programs. Congress could also ask for greater transparency in fiscal data. While the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the U.S. Treasury Bureau of the Fiscal Service provide extensive data on user fees and charges, it is difficult to conduct governmentwide analyses using publicly available sources. Congress could mandate more detailed and more easily accessed data on user fees and charges. Additional funding may be needed to develop the capacity to issue those data."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4022}

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report starts by explaining that the U.S. Constitution doesn't clearly specify how military bases are managed. The President, as commander-in-chief, has historically had broad authority to open, close, or realign bases, but Congress has also had a role through its power to raise armies and regulate the militia. In 1977, Congress passed a law (10 U.S.C. 2687) that limited the President's ability to close major bases, requiring lengthy assessments and congressional review. This led to the BRAC process, which was first implemented in 1988. The BRAC process involves an independent commission evaluating base closures and realignments, with the President and Congress having the final say. The report details the BRAC process's steps, selection criteria, and challenges, including cost overruns and discrepancies in savings estimates. It also mentions the 2005 BRAC round, which was the largest and had significant cost overruns, leading to skepticism about future BRAC rounds. The Department of Defense has requested new BRAC rounds to address excess infrastructure, but Congress has sometimes blocked them. The report also discusses the In-State BRAC provisions from the 2019 NDAA, which allow for state-level closures without the full BRAC process. Finally, it notes ongoing debates about the effectiveness of BRAC and the need for better data and accountability.\n\nNow, I need to condense this into a one-page summary. I should start with the main points: the constitutional framework, the evolution of BRAC, the process, challenges, and current status. I need to mention the key legislation, the BRAC rounds, the selection criteria, the issues with cost estimates, and the current legislative proposals.

Congress has instead periodically granted temporary authorities—known as a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC)—that have established independent commissions for the review and approval of basing changes submitted by the Secretary of Defense. These unique and transient authorities last expired on April 16, 2006. There have been five rounds of base closures: 1988, 1991, 1993, 1995, and 2005. Though Congress has periodically adjusted the BRAC process to account for lessons learned, the modern framework has remained generally consistent with earlier rounds, and includes establishment of an independent commission; reliance on objective and uniform criteria; Government Accountability Office (GAO) review and certification of Department of Defense (DOD) data; deliberations designed to be transparent that include open hearings, solicitation of feedback, installation visits, and data available for public review; and requirement that the final list of closure and realignment recommendations be accepted or rejected in their entirety. Congress has defined BRAC selection criteria in statute, thus requiring the Secretary to prioritize military value over cost savings. Additionally, Congress has required the Secretary to align the Department's recommendations with a comprehensive 20-year force structure plan. The commission may modify, reject, or add recommendations during its review before forwarding a final list to the President. After receiving the Commission's list of recommendations, the President may either accept the report in its entirety or seek to modify it by indicating disapproval and returning it to the commission for further evaluation. If the President accepts the commission's recommendations, they are forwarded to Congress. BRAC implementation begins by default unless Congress rejects the recommendations in their entirety within 45 days by enacting a joint resolution. During the implementation phase, DOD is required to initiate closures and realignments within two years and complete all actions within six years. The BRAC process represents a legislative compromise between the executive and legislative branches wherein each shares power in managing the closure and realignment of military bases. The imposition of an independent, third-party mediator was intended to insulate base closings from political considerations by both branches that had complicated similar actions in the past.

In addition, an IHE must satisfy the program integrity triad, under which it must be licensed or otherwise legally authorized to operate in the state in which it is physically located, accredited or preaccredited by an agency recognized for that purpose by the Department of Education (ED), and certified by ED as eligible to participate in Title IV programs. These requirements are intended to provide a balance between consumer protection, quality assurance, and oversight and compliance in postsecondary education providers participating in Title IV student aid programs. An IHE must also fulfill a variety of other related requirements, including those that relate to institutional recruiting practices, student policies and procedures, and the administration of the Title IV student aid programs.

{"pred": " The report provides an overview of Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD), its potential impact on the United States, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) approach to responding to an FMD outbreak. FMD is a highly contagious viral disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals, causing severe productivity losses but not posing a direct threat to human health. The U.S. has not experienced an FMD outbreak since 1929, but the disease could be introduced from countries where it is endemic. Given the size and mobility of the U.S. livestock sector, the country is vulnerable to FMD transmission. An outbreak could have significant economic consequences, including trade disruptions, loss of livestock, and reduced consumer demand for animal products. The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) leads the response to FMD, coordinating with federal, state, tribal, and industry partners. Key response strategies include surveillance, epidemiologic tracing, diagnostic testing, quarantines, biosecurity measures, stamping out infected animals, and vaccination. The USDA has developed a vaccine bank and plans to use vaccination strategies, particularly in large outbreaks, as reliance on stamping out alone may not be feasible. However, challenges remain, including limited vaccine supply, difficulties in diagnosing FMD, inadequate biosecurity on some premises, and logistical issues in depopulation and carcass disposal. The report also highlights the need for improved communication, coordination, and preparedness, as well as the importance of prioritizing and monitoring corrective actions to address these challenges. USDA has taken steps to enhance preparedness through exercises and training, but more work is needed to ensure effective response capabilities. The report concludes with recommendations for USDA to follow its established procedures for prioritizing and monitoring corrective actions to better prepare for and respond to an FMD outbreak.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report about FMD and USDA's response. Let me start by understanding the main points. The report explains what FMD is, its impact, and how the USDA plans to handle an outbreak. It also discusses the challenges they might face and the steps they've taken to prepare.\n\nFirst, I should mention FMD as a highly contagious virus affecting cloven-hoofed animals, leading to productivity losses but not human health risks. The U.S. hasn't had an outbreak since 1929, but it's vulnerable due to the large livestock sector. The economic impact could be severe, referencing the 2001", "answers": ["FMD is a highly contagious viral disease that causes painful lesions on the hooves and mouths of some livestock, making it difficult for them to stand or eat, thus greatly reducing meat and milk production. The United States has not had an FMD outbreak since 1929, but FMD is present in much of the world. An FMD outbreak in the United States could have serious economic impacts, in part because trade partners would likely halt all imports of U.S. livestock and livestock products until the disease was eradicated. These imports were valued at more than $19 billion in 2017. GAO was asked to review USDA's efforts to prepare for an FMD outbreak. This report examines (1) USDA's planned approach for responding to an FMD outbreak; (2) challenges USDA would face in pursuing its response goals; and (3) how USDA identifies, prioritizes, and monitors corrective actions to mitigate the challenges. GAO observed a USDA FMD preparedness exercise; reviewed agency documents and nongeneralizable questionnaire responses from 29 respondents from federal and state government, livestock industries, and universities; and interviewed officials from federal and state governments and representatives of livestock industries and universities. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) planned approach for responding to an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) includes several strategies. These strategies generally rely on killing infected and susceptible animals, vaccinating uninfected animals, or a combination of both approaches. USDA would implement one or more of the strategies, depending on factors such as the outbreak's size and the resources available, according to agency documents. USDA would likely face significant challenges in pursuing its response goals of detecting, controlling, and containing FMD quickly; eradicating FMD while seeking to stabilize industry and the economy; and facilitating continuity of commerce in uninfected animals. GAO identified challenges in 11 areas—including allocating a limited supply of FMD vaccine—based on its review of USDA documents, responses to GAO's questionnaire, and interviews with agency officials and others with expertise on FMD. According to USDA, the agency may not have a sufficient supply of FMD vaccine to control more than a small outbreak because of limited resources to obtain vaccine. As shown below, the current vaccine supply would be sufficient to protect about 14 percent of Texas's cattle or about 4 percent of Iowa's swine; these states' cattle and swine populations are the nation's largest. The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 includes a provision to increase the FMD vaccine supply. USDA has identified dozens of corrective actions to mitigate the challenges of responding to an FMD outbreak, as called for in USDA procedures, but has not prioritized these corrective actions or monitored their completion, as also called for in its procedures. USDA has identified the corrective actions through exercises simulating FMD outbreaks, surveys, and lessons learned from other foreign animal disease outbreaks. However, USDA has not completed all of the corrective actions, including actions related to vaccination. Agency officials stated that they have not completed such corrective actions because they have been responding to outbreaks of other animal diseases and have limited resources. Without following agency procedures to prioritize and monitor corrective actions, USDA cannot ensure that it is allocating its resources to the most beneficial actions to prepare for a possible FMD outbreak. GAO is recommending that USDA follow its procedures to prioritize and monitor the completion of corrective actions that the agency has identified for FMD preparedness. USDA agreed with these recommendations, and described actions it will take to implement them."], "all_classes": null, "length": 11771}
{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is about the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) efforts to expand access to Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorders. \n\nFirst, the report explains what opioids are, their risks, and how they can lead to addiction and overdose. It then discusses the three FDA-approved medications for MAT: methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone. Each has different mechanisms and uses. Methadone is a full agonist, buprenorphine is a partial agonist, and naltrexone is an antagonist. The report also mentions the Controlled Substances Act and the different settings where these medications can be prescribed, like OTPs and physician offices.\n\nNext, there are several grant programs under HHS aimed at expanding MAT access. These include the Targeted Capacity Expansion (MAT-PDOA), Substance Abuse Service Expansion Supplement to Health Centers, Increasing Access to MAT in Rural Primary Care Practices, and State Targeted Response to the Opioid Crisis (Opioid STR) grants. Each grant has specific goals and funding details. For example, MAT-PDOA grants are for states to increase capacity in high-risk communities, while the Opioid STR grants aim to reduce treatment gaps and overdose deaths.\n\nThe report also talks about the expansion of buprenorphine prescribing through waivers, allowing more practitioners to treat patients. There's mention of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) which expanded who can get these waivers, including nurse practitioners and physician assistants. \n\nDiversion control plans are discussed as a way to prevent misuse of MAT medications. These plans are required for OTPs and practitioners with higher patient limits. The report highlights the importance of these plans in balancing treatment needs with preventing diversion.\n\nHHS has an evaluation process for these efforts, but the report points out that they lack specific performance measures and targets to assess effectiveness. Recommendations are made to establish these measures and set clear timeframes for evaluations. \n\nAdditionally, the report includes examples of state, private insurer, and national association efforts to expand MAT access, such as outreach, training, and policy changes. However, the evaluation of HHS's effectiveness is still ongoing, and the report concludes with recommendations for improvement.\n\nNow, I need to cond", "answers": ["The misuse of prescription opioid pain relievers and illicit opioids, such as heroin, has contributed to increases in overdose deaths. According to the most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, in 2015 over 52,000 people died of drug overdose deaths, and about 63 percent of them involved an opioid. For those who are addicted to or misuse opioids, MAT has been shown to be an effective treatment. GAO was asked to review HHS and other efforts related to MAT for opioid use disorders. This report (1) describes HHS's key efforts to expand access to MAT, (2) examines HHS's evaluation, if any, of its efforts to expand access to MAT, and (3) describes efforts by selected stakeholders (states, private health insurers, and national associations) to expand access to MAT. GAO gathered information from HHS officials as well as a non-generalizable selection of 15 stakeholders selected based on their MAT expansion activities, among other factors. GAO also assessed HHS's evaluation plans using internal control standards for defining objectives and evaluating results. In an effort to reduce the prevalence of opioid misuse and the fatalities associated with it, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) established a goal to expand access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT). MAT is an approach that combines behavioral therapy and the use of certain medications, such as methadone and buprenorphine. HHS has implemented five key efforts since 2015 that focus on expanding access to MAT for opioid use disorders—four grant programs that focus on expanding access to MAT in various settings (including rural primary care practices and health centers) and regulatory changes that expand treatment capacity by increasing patient limits for buprenorphine prescribers and allowing nurse practitioners and physician assistants to prescribe buprenorphine. Some of the grant awards were made in 2015, while others were made as recently as May 2017. (See figure.) As of August 2017, efforts under all the grant programs were ongoing. Grant recipients can use funding to undertake a range of activities, such as hiring and training providers and supporting treatments involving MAT. In addition, certain providers and grant recipients are required to develop plans for preventing MAT medications from being diverted for nonmedical purposes. HHS officials told GAO that as of August 2017, the department was in the process of finalizing its plans to evaluate its efforts to address the opioid epidemic. In September 2016, HHS awarded a contract to conduct the evaluation. HHS officials told GAO that they are still working with the contractor to finalize the evaluation approach and that it will focus on whether HHS's efforts to address the opioid epidemic have been implemented as intended. HHS officials said that in the future, HHS may also evaluate whether, or to what extent, its efforts have been effective in expanding access to MAT, in addition to evaluating implementation. While HHS has some of the information that could be used in a future evaluation of the effectiveness of its efforts to expand access to MAT, it has not adopted specific performance measures with targets specifying the magnitude of the increases HHS hopes to achieve through its efforts to expand access to MAT, and by when. For example, HHS has not established a long-term target specifying the percentage increase in the number of prescriptions for buprenorphine HHS would like to achieve, which would help to show whether efforts by HHS and others are resulting in a sufficient number of prescriptions for MAT medications. HHS has also not chosen a specific method of measuring treatment capacity or established targets associated with it, which would help determine whether a sufficient number of providers are becoming available to evaluate and treat patients who may benefit from MAT. Without specifying these performance measures and associated targets, HHS will not have an effective means to determine whether its efforts are helping to expand access to MAT or whether new approaches are needed. Gauging this progress is particularly important given the large gap identified nationwide between the total number of individuals who could benefit from MAT and the limited number who can currently access it based on provider availability. In addition, GAO also found that as of August 2017, HHS had not finalized its approach for its planned evaluation activities, including timeframes. Without timeframes for the evaluation's activities, HHS increases the risk that the evaluation will not be completed as expeditiously as possible. In addition to HHS efforts to expand access to MAT, officials from selected states, private health insurers, and national associations reported using several efforts to expand patients' access to MAT for opioid use disorders. For example, several stakeholders provided GAO with the following examples of their efforts: States. State health officials from all five selected states have implemented or are planning approaches that focus on integrating the use of MAT into primary care, such as by providing services for centralized intake and initial management of patients or through telehealth that connects patients in rural areas with addiction specialists in a different location. Private health insurers. Three private health insurers reported removing prior authorization requirements for MAT medications so patients can avoid a waiting period before receiving the medications. National associations. Officials told GAO that they are conducting outreach and training for their members and developing tools and resource guides. For example, one association developed a road map with strategies that state policymakers can use to address the opioid epidemic, including strategies for reducing the stigma associated with MAT through educating the public and potential providers. GAO recommends that HHS take two actions: (1) establish performance measures with targets related to expanding access to MAT, and (2) establish timeframes for its evaluation of its efforts to expand access to MAT. HHS concurred with both recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5601}
{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about the Holman rule and the separation of authorization and appropriations in Congress. Let me start by understanding the key points.\n\nFirst, the report explains that Congress has a rule separating policy (authorization) from funding (appropriations). Authorization laws set up programs, while appropriations provide the money. This separation is a congressional tradition, formalized by the House and Senate. The House's version is called the Holman rule, which originated in 1835. \n\nThe Holman rule prohibits including non-authorization provisions in appropriations bills, except for retrenchments—like reducing spending. Over time, the rule evolved. In 1876, it allowed retrenchments that cut expenditures. Then, in 1885, it was removed and later reinstated. The rule was modified in 1983 to narrow the exception, allowing only reductions in money, not other things. \n\nIn the 115th Congress, a separate order expanded the rule to include reductions in salaries and number of officers. However, this was not adopted for the 116th Congress. The report also discusses how the House interprets the rule, like requiring an obvious reduction in funds and not allowing speculative savings or broad provisions. Examples include reducing employee numbers or salaries, but not broad legislative changes. \n\nThe summary needs to be concise, covering the origin, evolution, current state, and implications of the Holman rule. I should mention the separation of authorization and appropriations, the Holman rule's role, its historical development, key changes, and how it's applied today. Also, note the 115th Congress's attempt to expand it and the limitations. Make sure to keep it one page, double-spaced, with clear sections. Avoid jargon, explain terms like \"retrenchment\" if necessary. Check for flow and ensure all main points are included without getting too detailed.\nOkay, I need to structure this summary.

One such circumstance allows for the inclusion of legislative language in general appropriations bills or amendments thereto for \"germane provisions that retrench expenditures by the reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill.\" This exception appears in clause 2(b) of House Rule XXI and is known as the Holman rule, after Representative William Holman of Indiana, who first proposed the exception in 1876. Since the period immediately after its initial adoption, the House has interpreted the Holman rule through precedents that have tended to incrementally narrow its application. Under current precedents, for a legislative provision or amendment to be in order, the legislative language in question must be both germane to other provisions in the measure and must produce a clear reduction of appropriations in that bill. In addition, the House adopted a separate order during the 115th Congress that provided for retrenchments of expenditures by a reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill to be construed as applying to: any provision or amendment that retrenches expenditures by— (1) the reduction of amounts of money in the bill; (2) the reduction of the number and salary of the officers of the United States; or (3) the reduction of the compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury of the United States.

However, modern youth face more negative outcomes. The main issues include lack of shelter leading to risky behaviors, mental health problems, drug use, and exploitation. The government has responded with the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, which has evolved over time. There are three main programs: Basic Center Program (BCP), Transitional Living Program (TLP), and Street Outreach Program (SOP). These programs provide shelter, counseling, and support services. The report also discusses challenges in defining and counting homeless youth, the need for better data, and the impact of factors like family dynamics, mental health, and socioeconomic status. It mentions studies showing the prevalence of homelessness among LGBTQ youth and those in foster care.

Let me start by outlining the key points.\n\nFirst, the report discusses the historical context of runaway youth, noting that while it's not a new phenomenon, modern youth face more severe consequences. It highlights the vulnerabilities of homeless and runaway youth, including mental health issues, substance abuse, and exploitation. The federal response began with the Runaway Youth Act of 1974, which evolved into the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (RHYA", "answers": ["This report discusses runaway and homeless youth, and the federal response to support this population. There is no single definition of the terms \"runaway youth\" or \"homeless youth.\" However, both groups of youth share the risk of not having adequate shelter and other provisions, and may engage in harmful behaviors while away from a permanent home. Youth most often cite family conflict as the major reason for their homelessness or episodes of running away. A youth's sexual orientation, sexual activity, school problems, and substance abuse are associated with family discord. The precise number of homeless and runaway youth is unknown due to their residential mobility and overlap among the populations. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is supporting data collection efforts, known as Voices of Youth Count, to better determine the number of homeless youth. The 2017 study found that approximately 700,000 youth ages 13 to 17 and 3.5 million young adults ages 18 to 25 experienced homelessness within a 12-month period because they were sleeping in places not meant for habitation, in shelters, or with others while lacking alternative living arrangements. From the early 20th century through the 1960s, the needs of runaway and homeless youth were handled locally through the child welfare agency, juvenile justice courts, or both. The 1970s marked a shift toward federal oversight of programs that help youth who had run afoul of the law, including those who committed status offenses (i.e., a noncriminal act that is considered a violation of the law because of the youth's age). The Runaway Youth Act of 1974 was enacted as Title III of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (P.L. 93-415) to assist runaways through services specifically for this population. The act was amended over time to include homeless youth. It authorizes funding for services carried out under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program (RHYP), which is administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The program was most recently authorized through FY2020 by the Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-385). This law did not make other changes to the RHYP statute. Funding is discretionary, meaning provided through the appropriations process. FY2019 appropriations are $127.4 million. The RHYP program is made up of three components: the Basic Center Program (BCP), Transitional Living Program (TLP), and Street Outreach Program (SOP). The BCP provides temporary shelter, counseling, and after care services to runaway and homeless youth under age 18 and their families. In FY2017, the program served 23,288 youth, and in FY2018 it funded 280 BCP shelters (most recent figures available). The TLP is targeted to older youth ages 16 through 22 (and sometimes an older age). In FY2017, the TLP program served 3,517 youth, and in FY2018 it funded 299 grantees (most recent figures available). Youth who use the TLP receive longer-term housing with supportive services. The SOP provides education, treatment, counseling, and referrals for runaway, homeless, and street youth who have been subjected to, or are at risk of being subjected to, sexual abuse, sex exploitation, and trafficking. In FY2017, the SOP grantees made contact with 24,366 youth. The RHYP is a part of larger federal efforts to end youth homelessness through the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH). The USICH is a coordinating body made up of multiple federal agencies committed to addressing homelessness. The USICH's Opening Doors plan to end homelessness includes strategies for ending youth homelessness by 2020, including through collecting better data and supporting evidence-based practices to improve youth outcomes. Voices of Youth Count is continuing to report on characteristics of homeless youth. In addition to the RHYP, there are other federal supports to address youth homelessness. HUD's Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program is funding a range of housing options for youth, in selected urban and rural communities.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points. \n\nThe report is about the long-term fiscal outlook for state and local governments in the U.S. The main finding is that without policy changes, there's a projected gap between revenues and expenditures over the next 50 years. The operating balance, which is the difference between current revenues and expenditures, is expected to remain negative because expenditures are growing faster than revenues. \n\nThe report mentions that health care costs, especially Medicaid and employee benefits, are a major driver of rising expenditures. Medicaid spending is expected to grow faster than GDP, and health benefits for employees and retirees are also increasing. Pension obligations are another concern, as current contribution rates might not be enough to meet future liabilities, even with increased assets. \n\nThe fiscal gap is calculated as a 14.7% reduction in total expenditures or a 2.4% of GDP increase in revenues. The report suggests that a combination of spending cuts and revenue increases would be necessary to close this gap. \n\nFederal policies like the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and changes in Medicaid funding could affect state and local revenues. Also, the Supreme Court's decision on sales taxes might increase state revenues. However, there are uncertainties due to potential future federal policy changes and economic factors like GDP growth and pension returns. \n\nThe report also discusses the methodology used, including simulations based on historical data and projections from agencies like CBO and CMS.

Let me", "answers": ["Fiscal sustainability presents a national challenge shared by all levels of government. Since 2007, GAO has published simulations of long-term fiscal trends in the state and local government sector, which have consistently shown that the sector faces long-term fiscal pressures. While most states have requirements related to balancing their budgets, deficits can arise because the planned annual revenues are not generated at the expected rate, demand for services exceeds planned expenditures, or both, resulting in a near-term operating deficit. This report updates GAO's state and local fiscal model to simulate the fiscal outlook for the state and local government sector. This includes identifying the components of state and local expenditures likely to contribute to the sector's fiscal pressures. In addition, this report identifies considerations related to federal policy and other factors that could contribute to uncertainties in the state and local government sector's long-term fiscal outlook. GAO's model uses the Bureau of Economic Analysis's National Income and Product Accounts as the primary data source and presents the results in the aggregate for the state and local sector as a whole. The model shows the level of receipts and expenditures for the sector until 2067, based on current and historical spending and revenue patterns. In addition, the model assumes that the current set of policies in place across state and local government remains constant to show a simulated long-term outlook. GAO's simulations suggest that the state and local government sector will likely face an increasing difference between revenues and expenditures during the next 50 years as reflected by the operating balance--a measure of the sector's ability to cover its current expenditures out of its current receipts. While both expenditures and revenues are projected to increase as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), a difference between the two is projected to persist because expenditures are expected to grow faster than revenues throughout the simulation period. GAO's simulations also suggest that growth in the sector's overall spending is largely driven by health care expenditures--in particular, Medicaid spending and spending on health benefits for state and local government employees and retirees. These expenditures are projected to grow as a share of GDP during the simulation period. GAO's simulations also suggest that revenues from personal income taxes and federal grants to states and localities will increase during the simulation period. However, revenues will grow more slowly than expenditures such that the sector faces a declining fiscal outlook. GAO also identified federal policy changes that could affect the state and local government sector's fiscal outlook. For example, the effects of the recently-enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will likely depend on how states incorporate the Act into their state income tax rules.

Because the EFV was intended to replace the 40-year-old Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAV), the Pentagon pledged to move quickly to develop a \"more affordable and sustainable\" vehicle to replace the EFV. The Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) is intended to replace the AAV, incorporating some EFV capabilities but in a more practical and cost-efficient manner. In concert with the ACV, the Marines were developing the Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC) to serve as a survivable and mobile platform to transport Marines when ashore. The MPC was not intended to be amphibious like an AAV, EFV, or the ACV but instead would be required to have a swim capability for inland waterways such as rivers, lakes, and other water obstacles such as shore-to-shore operations in the littorals. Both vehicles were intended to play central roles in future Marine amphibious operations. On June 14, 2013, Marine leadership put the MPC program \"on ice\" due to budgetary pressures but suggested the program might be resurrected some 10 years down the road when budgetary resources might be more favorable. In what was described as a \"drastic shift,\" the Marines decided to \"resurrect\" the MPC in March 2014. The Marines designated the MPC as ACV Increment 1.1 and planned to acquire about 200 vehicles. The Marines also plan to develop ACV Increment 1.2, a tracked, fully amphibious version, and at the time planned to acquire about 470 vehicles and fund an ongoing high water speed study. Although ACV Increment 1.1 is to have a swim capability, another mode of transport (ship or aircraft) would be required to get the vehicles from ship to shore. The Marines are reportedly exploring the possibility of developing a high water speed ACV 2.0, which could accompany tanks and light armored vehicles into combat. On November 5, 2014, the Marines released a draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for ACV Increment 1.1. On November 24, 2015, the Marine Corps awarded BAE Systems and SAIC contracts to develop ACV 1.1 prototypes for evaluation. BAE's contract was for $103.8 million and SAIC's for $121.5 million, and each company was to build 16 prototypes to be tested over the next two years. Both BAE and SAIC delivered their prototypes early, and Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) testing began mid-March 2017. In early December 2017, the Marines reportedly sent the ACV 1.1 down select request for proposals to BAE and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). On June 19, 2018, the Marine Corps selected BAE Systems to produce the ACV.

Israeli domestic political issues, including elections scheduled for 2019. Israel relies on a number of strengths to manage potential threats to its security and existence. It maintains conventional military superiority relative to neighboring states and the Palestinians. It also takes measures to deter attack and defend its population and borders from evolving asymmetric threats such as rockets and missiles, cross-border tunneling, drones, and cyberattacks. Additionally, Israel has an undeclared but presumed nuclear weapons capability. Against a backdrop of strong bilateral cooperation, Israel's leaders and supporters routinely make the case that Israel's security and the broader stability of the region remain critically important for U.S. interests.

All of these amounts remain subject to congressional appropriations. Israeli officials seek to counter Iranian regional influence and prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu released new Israeli intelligence on Iran's nuclear program in April 2018, days before President Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 international agreement that constrains Iran's nuclear activities. It is unclear whether Israel might take future military action in Iran if Iranian nuclear activities resume.

The prospects for an Israeli-Palestinian peace process are complicated by many factors. Palestinian leaders cut off high-level political contacts with the Trump Administration after it recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December 2017. U.S.-Palestinian tensions have since worsened amid U.S. cutoffs of funding to the Palestinians and diplomatic moves—including the May 2018 opening of the U.S. embassy to Israel in Jerusalem. Palestinian leaders interpreted these actions as prejudicing their claims to a capital in Jerusalem and to a just resolution of Palestinian refugee claims. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has welcomed these U.S. actions. The Trump Administration has suggested that it will release a proposed peace plan after Israeli elections, which are scheduled for April 9, 2019. Speculation continues about how warming ties between Israel and Arab Gulf states may affect Israeli-Palestinian diplomacy, though Saudi Arabia said that the U.S. policy change on the Golan Heights would negatively affect the peace process. Bouts of tension and violence between Israel and Hamas in Gaza have continued—reportedly accompanied by indirect talks between the two parties that are being brokered by Egypt and aim for a long-term cease-fire. Domestically, Israel is preparing for the April 9 elections, which are closely contested. Former top general Benny Gantz is combining with former Finance Minister Yair Lapid to challenge Netanyahu, whom the attorney general has recommended be indicted for corruption in three separate cases. The elections and subsequent government formation process will have significant implications for Israel's future leadership and policies."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3079}
{"pred": " The Department of Defense (DOD) establishes foreign currency budget rates to manage overseas expenditures, using methodologies that have evolved over time. Initially, DOD relied on a 5-year average of exchange rates, but in 2017, it shifted to a 6-month average of Wall Street Journal rates to better reflect current market conditions and account for the strength of the U.S. Dollar. This change reduced projected gains and losses in funding needs, aligning budget rates more closely with market rates. DOD revises its rates annually based on market fluctuations, which affects its O&M and MILPERS funding requirements. For example, in fiscal year 2016, a $1.5 billion reduction in appropriations led to revised rates that adjusted projected gains and losses. DOD uses the International Treasury Services (ITS.gov) system to manage disbursements, offering various rates, including spot and advanced rates. While the 5-day advanced rate is commonly used, the 3-day advanced and spot rates can be more cost-effective. Analysis of disbursements in 2017 showed potential savings by using these more favorable rates, with the Army estimating $6.04 million in savings from switching to the 3-day rate. However, DOD has not consistently reviewed or optimized rate selection across services, leading to potential inefficiencies. The Foreign Currency Fluctuations Defense (FCFD) account, established in 1979, helps manage gains and losses from currency fluctuations, but DOD has not effectively managed its balance based on projected losses. Instead, it maintains the account at a statutory maximum of $970 million, often using unobligated balances without considering actual needs. This approach may result in holding excess funds that could be more efficiently used elsewhere. DOD’s financial reporting on foreign currency fluctuations for fiscal years 2009 through 2016 was incomplete and inaccurate, affecting the ability to manage the FCFD account effectively. The report recommends that DOD review foreign currency rates for cost savings, analyze losses to determine the appropriate FCFD balance, revise financial regulations for accurate reporting, and address data inconsistencies in the Army’s system. These steps aim to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and ensure better management of foreign currency funds.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report about the Department of Defense's foreign currency budget rates and related financial management. Let me start by understanding the key points.\n\nFirst, the report discusses how DOD sets foreign currency", "answers": ["DOD requested about $60 billion for fiscal years 2009 - 2017 to purchase goods and services overseas and reimburse service-members for costs incurred while stationed abroad. DOD uses foreign currency exchange rates to budget and pay (that is, disburse amounts) for these expenses. It also manages the FCFD account to mitigate a loss in buying power that results from foreign currency rate changes. GAO was asked to examine DOD's processes to budget for and manage foreign currency fluctuations. This report (1) describes DOD's revision of its foreign currency budget rates since 2009 and the relationship between the revised rates and projected O&M and MILPERS funding needs; (2) evaluates the extent to which DOD has taken steps to reduce costs in selecting foreign currency rates to disburse funds to liquidate O&M obligations, and determined whether opportunities exist to gain additional savings; and (3) assesses the extent to which DOD has effectively managed the FCFD account balance. GAO analyzed data on foreign currency rates, DOD financial management regulations, a non-generalizable sample of foreign currency disbursement data, and FCFD account balances. The Department of Defense (DOD) revised its foreign currency exchange rates (“budget rates”) during fiscal years 2014 through 2016 for each of the nine foreign currencies it uses to develop its Operation and Maintenance (O&M) and Military Personnel (MILPERS) budget request. These revisions decreased DOD's projected O&M and MILPERS funding needs. DOD's revision of the budget rates during these years also decreased the expected gains (that is, buying power) that would have resulted from an increase in the strength of the U.S. Dollar relative to other foreign currencies. DOD did not revise its budget rates in fiscal years 2009 through 2013. For fiscal year 2017, DOD changed its methodology for producing budget rates, resulting in rates that were more closely aligned with market rates. According to officials, that change made it unnecessary to revise the budget rates during the fiscal year. DOD has taken some steps to reduce costs in selecting foreign currency rates used to pay (that is, disburse amounts) for goods and services, but DOD has not fully determined whether opportunities exist to achieve additional savings. The Army has estimated potential savings of up to $10 million annually by using a foreign currency rate available 3 days in advance of paying for goods or services rather than a more costly rate available up to 5 days in advance. The Army has converted to the use of a 3-day advanced rate. GAO's analysis suggests that DOD could achieve cost savings if the services reviewed and consistently selected the most cost-effective foreign currency rates when paying for their goods and services. Absent a review, DOD is at risk for paying more than it would otherwise be required to conduct its transactions. DOD used the Foreign Currency Fluctuations, Defense (FCFD) account to cover losses (that is, less buying power) due to unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations in 6 of the 8 years GAO reviewed. Since 2012, DOD has maintained the FCFD account balance at the statutory limit of $970 million, largely by transferring unobligated balances before they are cancelled from certain DOD accounts into the FCFD. However, DOD has not identified the appropriate FCFD account balance needed to maintain program operations by routinely analyzing projected losses and basing any transfers into the account on those expected losses. Thus, DOD may be maintaining balances that are hundreds of millions of dollars higher than needed, and that could have been used for other purposes or returned to the Treasury Department (see figure). GAO is making four recommendations, including that DOD review opportunities to achieve cost savings by more consistently selecting the most cost-effective foreign currency rates used for the payment of goods and services, and analyze projected losses to manage the FCFD account balance. DOD generally concurred with the recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10667}

Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points.\n\nThe report discusses DHS's management of the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program, focusing on five areas: identifying high-risk facilities, risk assessment and prioritization, reviewing security plans, compliance inspections, and stakeholder outreach. The report mentions past findings and the actions DHS has taken to address issues.\n\nFirst, there was a problem with underreporting of ammonium nitrate facilities. DHS worked with other agencies and states to find non-compliant facilities, leading to identifying 1,000 more facilities. They also improved data sharing through a working group. Then, there was an issue with the Distance of Concern calculation, which DHS fixed by updating the Top-Screen tool to calculate it themselves, leading to better accuracy.\n\nRisk assessment was another area. The original approach didn't consider all elements like economic consequences. DHS developed a new model with Sandia and Oak Ridge labs, revised the tiering methodology, and did peer reviews. They also updated the CSAT tool to make it more efficient.\n\nFor security plan reviews, DHS reduced the backlog by streamlining processes and implementing an Expedited Approval Program (EAP). However, EAP participation was low, with only 18 out of 3,152 eligible facilities using it. Reasons included timing, strict measures, and lack of inspections.\n\nCompliance inspections found non-compliance issues, and DHS is updating SOPs to manage compliance better. Stakeholder outreach was improved with a feedback questionnaire.\n\nThe summary needs to be concise, covering all these points without getting too detailed. I should structure it into sections: introduction, key findings, actions taken, and ongoing efforts. Make sure to mention the main recommendations and how DHS addressed them. Also, note the current status, like the EAP participation and pending reviews. Keep it double-spaced, one page, with clear headings. Avoid jargon where possible, but since it's a summary for a government report, some technical terms are necessary. Check for flow and ensure each paragraph transitions smoothly. Let me start drafting.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of the report. Let me start by outlining the main points. The report discusses DHS's management of the CFATS program, focusing on five areas: identifying high-risk facilities,", "answers": ["Thousands of facilities have hazardous chemicals that could be targeted or used to inflict mass casualties or harm surrounding populations in the United States. In accordance with the DHS Appropriations Act, 2007, DHS established the CFATS program in 2007 to, among other things, identify and assess the security risk posed by chemical facilities. DHS inspects high-risk facilities after it approves facility security plans to ensure that the facilities are implementing required security measures and procedures. This statement summarizes progress and challenges related to DHS's CFATS program management. This statement is based on prior products GAO issued from July 2012 through June 2017, along with updates conducted in June 2018 on DHS actions to address prior GAO recommendations. To conduct the prior work, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and DHS policies for administering the CFATS program, how DHS assesses risk, and data on high-risk chemical facilities. GAO also interviewed DHS officials and reviewed information on DHS actions to implement its prior recommendations. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has made progress addressing challenges that GAO's past work identified to managing the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program. The following summarizes progress made and challenges remaining in key aspects of the program. Identifying high-risk chemical facilities. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS used self-reported and unverified data to determine the risk of facilities holding toxic chemicals that could threaten surrounding communities if released. GAO recommended that DHS should better verify the accuracy of facility-reported data. DHS implemented this recommendation by revising its methodology so it now calculates the risk of toxic release, rather than relying on facilities to do so. Assessing risk and prioritizing facilities. In April 2013, GAO reported weaknesses in multiple aspects of DHS's risk assessment and prioritization approach. GAO made two recommendations for DHS to review and improve this process, including that DHS enhance its risk assessment approach to incorporate all of the elements of consequence, threat, and vulnerability associated with a terrorist attack involving certain chemicals. DHS launched a new risk assessment methodology in October 2016 and is currently gathering new or updated data from about 27,000 facilities to (1) determine which facilities should be categorized as high-risk because of the threat of sabotage, theft or diversion, or a toxic release and (2) assign those facilities deemed high risk to one of four risk-based tiers. GAO has ongoing work assessing these efforts and will report later this summer on the extent to which they fully address prior recommendations. Reviewing and approving facilities' site security plans . DHS is to review security plans and visit facilities to ensure their security measures meet DHS standards. In April 2013, GAO reported a 7 to 9 year backlog for these reviews and visits. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS had made substantial progress in addressing the backlog—estimating that it could take between 9 and 12 months for DHS to review and approve security plans for the approximately 900 remaining facilities. DHS has since taken additional action to expedite these activities and has eliminated this backlog. Inspecting facilities and ensuring compliance. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS conducted compliance inspections at 83 of the 1,727 facilities with approved security plans. GAO found that nearly half of the inspected facilities were not fully compliant with their approved security plans and that DHS did not have documented procedures for managing facilities' compliance. GAO recommended that DHS document procedures for managing compliance. As a result, DHS has developed an enforcement procedure and a draft compliance inspection procedure and expects to finalize the compliance inspection procedure by the end of fiscal year 2018. GAO has made various recommendations to strengthen DHS's management of the CFATS program, with which DHS has generally agreed. DHS has implemented or described planned actions to address most of these recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2363}
{"pred": " The report provides an overview of the U.S. coal mining industry and the regulatory framework governing surface mining and reclamation, focusing on the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) and its implementation by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE). In 2016, coal accounted for 17 percent of energy production and 30 percent of electricity production in the U.S., with approximately 730 million tons mined domestically, 40 percent on federal lands. Coal is mined through surface and underground methods, both of which can disturb land and affect water quality. SMCRA mandates reclamation of mined lands, requiring operators to obtain permits and provide financial assurances to ensure reclamation. Financial assurances include surety bonds, collateral bonds, and self-bonds, with self-bonds available only to financially solvent operators. As of 2017, states and OSMRE held approximately $10.2 billion in financial assurances, with surety bonds comprising the majority. However, challenges exist, including insufficient financial assurances, difficulties in managing self-bonds, and the risk of surety company insolvency. Some states have implemented trust funds to address unanticipated reclamation costs. The report highlights the need for ongoing oversight and potential reforms to the SMCRA to mitigate financial risks associated with self-bonding and ensure adequate reclamation of coal mine sites.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report. Let me start by reading through the user's query again to make sure I understand what they need. The report is about the U.S. coal mining industry, focusing on production, mining methods, environmental impacts, and the regulatory framework under SMCRA. The user wants a concise summary, so I need to highlight the key points without getting too detailed.\n\nFirst, I should mention the key statistics from 2016: coal's role in energy production, the amount mined, and the percentage from federal lands. Then, the two mining methods—surface and underground—and their environmental impacts, like water quality issues. \n\nNext, the SMCRA and OSMRE's role in regulating reclamation. The financial assurances required, the types (surety bonds, collateral, self-bonds), and the challenges with self-bonds, especially with recent bankruptcies. Also, the financial assurance amounts and how they're managed, including the issues with surety companies going bankrupt and the need for trust funds in some states.\n\nI should also note the abandoned mine", "answers": ["Coal accounts for 17 percent of domestic energy production. SMCRA requires coal mine operators to reclaim lands that were disturbed during mining and to submit a financial assurance in an amount sufficient to ensure that adequate funds will be available to complete reclamation if the operator does not do so. Recent coal company bankruptcies have drawn attention to whether financial assurances obtained by OSMRE and state agencies will be adequate to reclaim land once coal mining operations have ceased. GAO was asked to review management of financial assurances for coal mine reclamation. This report describes, among other things, the amounts and types of financial assurances held for coal mine reclamation in 2017 and the challenges that OSMRE and state agencies face in managing these financial assurances. GAO collected and analyzed data from OSMRE and 23 state agencies; reviewed federal laws, regulations, and directives; and interviewed OSMRE and state agency officials and representatives from organizations associated with the mining and financial assurance industries and environmental organizations. State agencies and the Department of the Interior's Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) reported holding approximately $10.2 billion in surety bonds (guaranteed by a third party), collateral bonds (guaranteed by a tangible asset, such as a certificate of deposit), and self-bonds (guaranteed on the basis of a coal operator's own finances) as financial assurances for coal mine reclamation. OSMRE and state agencies face several challenges in managing financial assurances, according to the stakeholders GAO interviewed. Specifically, Obtaining additional financial assurances from operators for unanticipated reclamation costs, such as long-term treatment for water pollution, can be difficult. Determining the financial stability of surety companies has been challenging in certain instances. Self-bonding presents a risk to the government because it is difficult to (1) ascertain the financial health of an operator, (2) determine whether the operator qualifies for self-bonding, and (3) obtain a replacement for existing self-bonds when an operator no longer qualifies. In addition, some stakeholders said that the risk from self-bonding is greater now than when the practice was first authorized under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA). GAO's previous work examining environmental cleanup found that the financial risk to government and the amount of oversight needed for self-bonds are relatively high compared to other forms of financial assurances. GAO also previously reviewed federal financial assurance requirements for various energy and mineral extraction sectors and found that coal mining is the only one where self-bonding was allowed. However, because SMCRA explicitly allows states to decide whether to accept self-bonds, eliminating the risk that self-bonds pose to the federal government and states would require SMCRA be amended. GAO recommends that Congress consider amending SMCRA to eliminate self-bonding. Interior neither agreed nor disagreed with GAO's recommendation."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6217}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report about funding gaps and continuing resolutions. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report explains how federal agencies are funded annually through regular appropriations acts. If those acts are delayed, a continuing resolution (CR) is used as an interim measure. The fiscal year started in October 1977, and there have been instances where regular appropriations weren't enacted on time, leading to funding gaps. The Antideficiency Act prohibits spending without appropriations, so during a funding gap, agencies can't make contracts or obligate funds unless authorized by law. The Civiletti letters from 1980 and 1981 clarified that during a funding gap, agencies can only perform certain essential functions, leading to government shutdowns for non-excepted activities. \n\nThe report mentions that funding gaps have occurred 20 times since 1977, with some lasting up to 34 days. The most recent ones in 2014, 2018, and 2019 caused widespread furloughs. There's also a mention of automatic continuing resolutions (ACRs) proposed to prevent funding gaps, but none have been enacted. The report also details specific instances, like the 1996 funding gap that furloughed 800,000 workers, and the 2013-2014 gap that affected over 800,000 employees. \n\nI need to condense all this into a concise summary. Start with the purpose of the report: explaining funding gaps and CRs. Mention the fiscal year structure, the role of regular appropriations and CRs. Highlight the Antideficiency Act and the Civiletti letters' impact on shutdowns. Include the number of funding gaps, their durations, and examples. Note the proposed ACRs and their lack of enactment. Conclude with the implications of funding gaps on government operations and the need for timely appropriations. Make sure to keep it within one page, so I'll need to be concise and avoid too much detail on each example. Check for clarity and flow, ensuring that the summary captures the main points without getting bogged down in specifics.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of the report. Let me start by outlining the key points:\n\n1. **Funding Mechanisms**: Federal agencies are funded annually", "answers": ["The Antideficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341-1342, 1511-1519) generally bars the obligation of funds in the absence of appropriations. Exceptions are made under the act, including for activities involving \"the safety of human life or the protection of property.\" The interval during the fiscal year when appropriations for a particular project or activity are not enacted into law, either in the form of a regular appropriations act or a continuing resolution (CR), is referred to as a funding gap or funding lapse. Although funding gaps may occur at the start of the fiscal year, they may also occur any time a CR expires and another CR (or the regular appropriations bill) is not enacted immediately thereafter. Multiple funding gaps may occur within a fiscal year. When a funding gap occurs, federal agencies are generally required to begin a shutdown of the affected projects and activities, which includes the prompt furlough of non-excepted personnel. The general practice of the federal government after the shutdown has ended has been to retroactively pay furloughed employees for the time they missed, as well as employees who were required to come to work. Although a shutdown may be the result of a funding gap, the two events should be distinguished. This is because a funding gap may result in a total shutdown of all affected projects or activities in some instances but not others. For example, when funding gaps are of a short duration, agencies may not have enough time to complete a shutdown of affected projects and activities before funding is restored. In addition, the Office of Management and Budget has previously indicated that a shutdown of agency operations within the first day of the funding gap may be postponed if a resolution appears to be imminent. Since FY1977, 20 funding gaps occurred, ranging in duration from 1 day to 34 full days. These funding gaps are listed in Table 1. About half of these funding gaps were brief (i.e., three days or less in duration). Notably, many of the funding gaps do not appear to have resulted in a \"shutdown.\" Prior to the issuance of the opinions in 1980 and early 1981 by then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti, while agencies tended to curtail some operations in response to a funding gap, they often \"continued to operate during periods of expired funding.\" In addition, some of the funding gaps after the Civiletti opinions did not result in a completion of shutdown operations due to both the funding gap's short duration and an expectation that appropriations would soon be enacted. Some of the funding gaps during this period, however, did have a broader impact on affected government operations, even if only for a matter of hours. Two funding gaps occurred in FY1996, amounting to 5 days and 21 days. The chronology of regular and continuing appropriations enacted during FY1996 is illustrated in Figure 1. At the beginning of FY2014 (October 1, 2013), none of the regular appropriations bills had been enacted, so a government-wide funding gap occurred. It concluded on October 17, 2013, after lasting 16 full days. During FY2018, there was a funding gap when a CR covering all of the regular appropriations bills expired on January 19, 2018. It concluded on January 22, 2018, after lasting two full days. The most recent funding gap occurred during FY2019, when a CR covering federal agencies and activities funded in 7 of the 12 regular appropriations bills expired on December 21, 2018. It concluded on January 25, 2019, after lasting 34 full days.

However, there are challenges like fragmentation, overlap in procurement, and not meeting device reduction goals. The report also points out issues with financial reporting, where non-printing activities are included and key areas like device procurement are omitted. The recommendations include assessing DLA's role, improving internal controls, and enhancing financial reporting accuracy.\n\nNow, I need to condense all this into a one-page summary.

DLA Document Services has key DOD-wide responsibilities for (1) printing and reproduction, (2) print device procurement, and (3) electronic content management (e.g., digital document repositories). Other DOD components, including the military services, also maintain some document services capabilities at various locations. House Report 115-200 accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018 included a provision for GAO to examine DOD's document services. This report evaluates (1) the progress DOD has made in achieving efficiencies in its document services and opportunities, if any, to achieve further efficiencies, and (2) the extent to which DOD reports accurate financial information about its document services to key stakeholders. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials regarding DOD's efficiency initiatives, including DLA Document Services' transformation plan; reviewed print device procurement contracts and pricing information; and analyzed DOD budget data for fiscal years 2012 through 2016. The Department of Defense (DOD) has taken steps to achieve efficiencies in its document services, including implementing a transformation plan to consolidate existing Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Document Services facilities. However, GAO identified four areas where further gains may be possible: Managing fragmentation in printing and reproduction services. DOD has designated DLA Document Services as the single manager for printing and reproduction services, but DOD customers, citing concerns with DLA's services, have also obtained these services directly from the Government Publishing Office and via in-house print facilities (see fig.). DOD has not assessed DLA's performance in this role or whether additional efficiencies may be possible in light of DLA's transformation plan. Reducing overlap in procuring print devices. GAO found that DOD components used at least four different contract sources to acquire print devices. DOD has not assessed which acquisition approach represents the best value; doing so might better position DOD to further reduce its costs. Meeting goals to reduce the number of print devices. DOD and the military services have not demonstrated that they achieved established goals for reducing the number of print devices. Additional controls and assignment of oversight responsibilities to monitor progress could better enable DOD to achieve its cost savings goals, estimated to be millions of dollars annually. Consolidating DLA facilities. DLA is closing or consolidating 74 of its 112 facilities in the United States. However, GAO found that for four of seven types of specialty services, DLA plans to retain facilities that are responsible for less than 5 percent of the total revenue for each of those specialties, which suggests that further consolidations are possible. DOD includes the cost of non-printing activities, such as the purchase of advertising time for recruiting, within its budget materials for printing and reproduction. It does not include costs to acquire print devices and for electronic content management. As a result, DOD and the Congress lack the oversight into total document services costs needed to make informed decisions.

The RTF policy requires agencies to submit annual Real Property Efficiency Plans, set reduction targets, and identify projects to reduce office and warehouse space. While most agencies reported progress in reducing space, challenges such as costs, mission requirements, employee concerns, and workload growth were noted. Agencies like HUD, USDA, and Interior have successfully consolidated operations, while IRS and SSA explored co-location and disposal.

GSA provides space for agencies in government-owned and commercially leased buildings. In 2015, the OMB issued a memorandum requiring the 24 agencies with chief financial officers to reduce their domestic office and warehouse space. These agencies are required to set annual reduction targets for a 5-year time period and update their real property plans annually. GAO was asked to review the implementation of this space reduction initiative. This report discusses: (1) the approaches and any challenges the 24 agencies identified to achieving their reduction targets for all their domestic office and warehouse space; (2) the extent these agencies reduced their space and met their fiscal year 2016 targets; and (3) how GSA manages vacated space it had leased to these agencies. GAO conducted a content analysis of the 24 agencies' real property plans for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 and analyzed agencies' data as submitted to GSA on their targets and reductions for fiscal year 2016, the only year for which data were available. GAO selected five agencies as case studies based on several factors, including size of the agencies' office and warehouse portfolio, agency reduction targets, and fiscal year 2016 reported reductions. GAO reviewed relevant documentation and interviewed officials from GSA, OMB, and GAO's case study agencies. GAO provided a draft of this product to GSA, OMB, and our case study agencies for comment. GAO incorporated technical comments, as appropriate. Most of the 24 agencies with chief financial officers reported to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the General Services Administration (GSA) that they planned to consolidate their office and warehouse space and allocate fewer square feet per employee as the key ways to achieve their space reduction targets. For example, the Department of Agriculture reported it will consolidate staff from five component agencies in two office buildings. When complete, the space allocated per employee will average about 250 square feet down from a high of 420 square feet per employee. In taking these actions, the agencies most often identified the cost of space reduction projects as a challenge to achieving their targets. Agencies cited costs such as for space renovations to accommodate more staff and required environmental clean-up before disposing of property as challenges to completing projects. Some agencies required to maintain offices across the country reported that their mission requirements limit their ability to reduce their space. In fiscal year 2016, 17 of the 24 agencies reported they reduced their space, but had varying success achieving their first-year targets. Of the 17 agencies, 9 exceeded their target and reduced more space than planned, 7 missed their target (by anywhere between 2.8 and 96.7 percent), and 1 reduced space, despite a targeted increase. Agency officials said that it is not unusual for projects to shift to different years and that such shifts could lead to missing targets one year and exceeding them the next. GSA has processes to manage the space vacated by agencies that is leased through GSA. For example, starting in November 2016, GSA started tracking agencies' space release requests centrally to help standardize the process and established an e-mail address to which agencies can submit requests. GSA relies on regional offices to manage real property in their regions and to identify tenants for vacant space or to remove unused space from the inventory. GSA's regional officials said regular monitoring and coordinating with agencies minimizes the likelihood GSA is caught off guard by a return of space. These processes also help them to plan ahead. GSA met its 2016 performance goal to have an annual vacant space rate of no more than 3.2 percent in its federally owned and leased buildings. However, given the recent implementation of the space reduction initiative, it is too early to determine the extent to which agencies will return space to GSA prior to the end of their leases and the effect on GSA's inventory."], "all_classes": null, "length": 7578}

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the main points. The report is about the decline of cash as a payment method and the rise of electronic payments. It discusses both the advantages and disadvantages of moving towards a cashless society.\n\nFirst, the report mentions that electronic payments have become more convenient and cost-effective due to technological advances. Traditional methods like credit and debit cards are still popular, but newer systems like Venmo and Square are also gaining traction. Cryptocurrencies are mentioned as an alternative, though they're not widely adopted yet. The report notes that in some countries like Sweden, cash usage is declining, and central banks are considering digital currencies.\n\nThe report then talks about the role of cash in the U.S. and how its usage has been decreasing. It references data showing that cash transactions have dropped from 40.7% in 2012 to 32.5% in 2015, but adjustments suggest the decline might be less than initially thought. The report also discusses the benefits of cash, like privacy and being a safe asset, and the costs, such as security risks and management expenses for businesses.\n\nThere's a section on the economic implications of reducing cash use. Proponents argue it could improve efficiency, reduce crime, and help with monetary policy. However, opponents worry about marginalizing those without access to financial systems, increased cyber risks, and loss of privacy. The report also mentions the potential for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) as a solution, but there are debates about their feasibility and impact on monetary policy.\n\nThe case studies of Sweden and Kenya are highlighted. Sweden's shift to electronic payments is driven by technology and consumer preference, while Kenya's M-Pesa service expanded financial access through mobile phones. However, cash is still used for small transactions in Kenya due to convenience and fees.\n\nI need to condense all this into a one-page summary. I should start with an introduction about the decline of cash and the rise of electronic payments. Then outline the key points: the role of cash, electronic payment systems, advantages and disadvantages, implications of a cashless society, and the case studies. I should also mention the debate around CBDCs and the potential effects on different groups. Make sure to keep it concise, double-spaced, and within the one-page limit. Avoid too", "answers": ["Electronic forms of payment have become increasingly available, convenient, and cost efficient due to technological advances in digitization and data processing. Anecdotal reporting and certain analyses suggest that businesses and consumers are increasingly eschewing cash payments in favor of electronic payment methods. Such trends have led analysts and policymakers to examine the possibility that the use and acceptance of cash will significantly decline in coming years and to consider the effects of such an evolution. Cash is still a common and widely accepted payment system in the United States. Cash's advantages include its simplicity and robustness as a payment system that requires no ancillary technologies. In addition, it provides privacy in transactions and protection from cyber threats or financial institution failures. However, using cash involves costs to businesses and consumers who pay fees to obtain, manage, and protect cash and exposes its users to loss through misplacement, theft, or accidental destruction of physical currency. Cash also concurrently generates government revenues through \"profits\" earned by producing it and by acting as interest-free liabilities to the Federal Reserve (in contrast to reserve balances on which the Federal Reserve pays interest), while reducing government revenues by facilitating some tax avoidance. The relative advantages and costs of various payment methods will largely determine whether and to what degree electronic payment systems will displace cash. Traditional noncash payment systems (such as credit and debit cards and interbank clearing systems) involving intermediaries such as banks and central banks address some of the shortcomings of cash payments. These systems can execute payments over physical distance, allow businesses and consumers to avoid some of the costs and risks of using cash, and are run by generally trusted and closely regulated intermediaries. However, the maintenance and operation of legacy noncash systems involve their own costs, and the intermediaries charge fees to recoup those costs and earn profits. The time it takes to finalize certain transactions—including crediting customer accounts for check or electronic deposits—can lead to consumers incurring additional costs. In addition, these systems involve cybersecurity risks and generally require customers to divulge their private personal information to gain system access, which raises privacy concerns. To date, the migration away from cash has largely been in favor of traditional noncash payment systems; however, some observers predict new alternative systems will play a larger role in the future. Such alternative systems aim to address some of the inefficiencies and risks of traditional noncash systems, but face obstacles to achieving that aim and involve costs of their own. Private systems using distributed ledger technology, such as cryptocurrencies, may not serve the main functions of money well and face challenges to widespread acceptance and technological scalability. These systems also raise concerns among certain observers related to whether these systems could facilitate crime, provide inadequate protections to consumers, and may adversely affect governments' ability to implement or transmit monetary policy. The potential for increased payment efficiency from these systems is promising enough that certain central banks have investigated the possibility of issuing government-backed, electronic-only currencies—called central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)—in such a way that the benefits of certain alternative payment systems could be realized with appropriately mitigated risk. How CBDCs would be created and function are still matters of speculation at this time, and the possibility of their introduction raises questions about the appropriate role of a central bank in the financial system and the economy. If the relative benefits and costs of cash and the various other payment methods evolve in such a way that cash is significantly displaced as a commonly accepted form of payment, that evolution could have a number of effects, both positive and negative, on the economy and society. Proponents of reducing cash usage (or even eliminating it all together and becoming a cashless society) argue that doing so will generate important benefits, including potentially improved efficiency of the payment system, a reduction of crime, and less constrained monetary policy. Proponents of maintaining cash as a payment option argue that significant reductions in cash usage and acceptance would further marginalize people with limited access to the financial system, increase the financial system's vulnerability to cyberattack, and reduce personal privacy. Based on their assessment of the magnitude of these benefits and costs and the likelihood that market forces will displace cash as a payment system, policymakers may choose to encourage or discourage this trend."], "all_classes": null, "length": 9601}

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nFirst, the report introduces the four PMAs: BPA, SEPA, SWPA, and WAPA. They were created to manage and sell electricity from federal dams, which were built for purposes like irrigation and flood control. The PMAs have to prioritize public utility districts and cooperatives, selling power at cost-based rates. FERC regulates their rates to ensure they repay the Treasury. Since FY2011, their revenues are considered discretionary offsetting receipts, meaning they have net-zero spending authority. Only WAPA and SWPA require congressional appropriations for capital expenses. Each PMA has unique regional issues.\n\nThen there's a detailed section on BPA. It's the oldest, self-financed, and has a large transmission system. They have a debt issue, with $5.53 billion in bonds. They're dealing with lower wholesale prices and renewable energy affecting their competitiveness. They have a partnership with Energy Northwest to manage debt, which affects their rates. Environmental issues with salmon and dams are mentioned, with legal challenges and potential dam removals. The Trump administration's proposal to sell transmission assets is also noted, but it was dropped due to opposition.\n\nNext, SEPA is the smallest, doesn't own transmission lines, contracts with others. They have an overcapacity issue, leading some customers to terminate contracts. SWPA is in the Southwestern states, uses rain-based water supply, faces challenges with low water conditions. They need congressional authority for long-term revenue use. WAPA is the largest, covers 15 western states, has a strategic plan, and is involved in transmission projects. They joined an RTO, which saved money. Droughts affect their operations, and they have a drought-adder program to manage costs.\n\nThe report also mentions the Trump administration's proposal to sell PMA assets, which was opposed. Congress has laws preventing executive branch from altering PMA structures without congressional approval. The PMAs' role in providing low-cost power to public utilities is a key statutory requirement, which could be affected by asset sales.\n\nNow, I need to condense all this into a one-page summary. Start with an introduction about the PMAs, their purpose, structure, and key functions. Then briefly mention each P", "answers": ["The federal government, through the Department of Energy, operates four regional power marketing administrations (PMAs), created by statute: the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), the Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA), the Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA), and the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA). Each PMA operates in a distinct geographic area. Congressional interest in the PMAs has included diverse issues such as rate setting, cost and compliance associated with the Endangered Species Act (ESA; P.L. 93-205; 16 U.S.C. §§1531 et seq.), and questions of privatization of these federal agencies. In general, the PMAs came into being because of the government's need to dispose of electric power produced by dams constructed largely for irrigation, flood control, or other purposes, and to achieve small community and farm electrification—that is, providing service to customers whom it would not have been profitable for a private utility to serve. With minor exceptions, these agencies market the electric power produced by federal dams constructed, owned, and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) and the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR). By statute, PMAs must give preference to public utility districts and cooperatives (e.g., \"preference customers\"), and sell their power at cost-based rates set at the lowest possible rate consistent with sound business principles. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates PMA rates to ensure that they are set high enough to repay the U.S. Treasury for the portion of federal facility costs allocated to hydropower beneficiaries. With energy and capacity markets changing in the western United States (especially with the growing need to integrate increasing amounts of variable renewable sources), and the development of the Energy Imbalance Market in the West, BPA and WAPA may have to adapt their plans with regard to generation needs and how transmission systems are developed. In 2018, the Trump Administration proposed to sell the transmission assets (lines, towers, substations, and/or rights of way) owned and operated by the federal Power Marketing Administrations. The proposal suggested that \"eliminating or reducing\" the federal government's role in owning and operating transmission assets, and increasing the private sector's role, would \"encourage a more efficient allocation of economic resources and mitigate unnecessary risk to taxpayers.\" The resulting PMA entities would then contract with other utilities to provide transmission services for the delivery of federal power, similar to what SEPA does currently. Reportedly, the proposed sale of PMA assets was dropped after opposition to the plan emerged from stakeholders. Under Section 208 of the Urgent Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1986 (P.L. 99-349), the executive branch is prohibited from spending funds to study or draft proposals to transfer from federal control any portion of the assets of the PMAs unless specifically authorized by Congress. Environmental, fishing, and tribal advocates have sued the federal government over concerns that operating rules for hydropower dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers (i.e., the National Marine Fisheries Service Biological Opinion) are inadequate to ensure survival of species threatened or endangered under the ESA. In 2016, a federal judge overturned a previous management plan for the dams, finding that it would not be sufficient to protect salmon runs, and ordered a new management plan that could include removing the dams. However, in 2018, President Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum accelerating the process for a new management plan, requiring the biological opinion to be ready by 2020. Since FY2011, power revenues associated with the PMAs have been classified as discretionary offsetting receipts (i.e., receipts that are available for spending by the PMAs), thus the agencies are sometimes noted as having a \"net-zero\" spending authority.

{"pred": " Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits sex discrimination in educational programs receiving federal funding. While the statute does not explicitly mention sexual harassment or abuse, courts and federal agencies have interpreted it to cover such conduct. The Supreme Court has established that schools can be held liable under Title IX for deliberate indifference in responding to sexual harassment, whether by teachers, students, or other staff. This liability standard requires schools to act in a manner that is not clearly unreasonable in light of known circumstances. Federal agencies, particularly the Department of Education (ED), have issued guidance documents that outline schools' responsibilities in addressing sexual harassment, including the requirement to designate Title IX Coordinators and establish grievance procedures. These guidelines have evolved over time, with recent proposed regulations aiming to redefine the scope of sexual harassment, require actual notice of harassment, and impose stricter due process protections for accused individuals. The proposed rules would align administrative standards with those used in private litigation, emphasizing deliberate indifference and requiring schools to follow specific procedures in investigations and adjudications. The report highlights the ongoing legal and administrative debates surrounding Title IX enforcement, including challenges to due process in disciplinary proceedings and the balance between protecting victims and ensuring fair treatment of accused individuals. The proposed regulations, if adopted, would significantly alter how schools respond to sexual harassment allegations, potentially affecting both the rights of victims and the responsibilities of educational institutions.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report about Title IX.

Let me check the original report again to", "answers": ["Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) provides an avenue of legal relief for victims of sexual abuse and harassment at educational institutions. It bars discrimination \"on the basis of sex\" in an educational program or activity receiving federal funding. Although Title IX makes no explicit reference to sexual harassment or abuse, the Supreme Court and federal agencies have determined that such conduct can sometimes constitute discrimination in violation of the statute; educational institutions in some circumstances can be held responsible when a teacher sexually harasses a student or when one student harasses another. Title IX is mainly enforced (1) through private rights of action brought directly against schools by or on behalf of students subjected to sexual misconduct; and (2) by federal agencies that provide funding to educational programs. To establish liability in a private right of action, a party seeking damages for a Title IX violation must satisfy the standards set forth by the Supreme Court in Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District, decided in 1998, and Davis Next Friend LaShonda D. v. Monroe County Board of Education, decided the next year. Gebser provides that when a teacher commits harassment against a student, a school district is liable only when it has actual knowledge of allegations by an \"appropriate person,\" and so deficiently responds to those allegations that its response amounts to deliberate indifference to the discrimination. Davis instructs that, besides showing actual knowledge by an appropriate person and deliberate indifference, a plaintiff suing for damages for sexual harassment committed by a student must show that the conduct was \"so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive\" that it denied the victim equal access to educational opportunities or benefits. Taken together, the Supreme Court's decisions set forth a high threshold for a private party seeking damages against an educational institution based on its response to sexual harassment. In turn, federal appellate courts have differed in how to apply the standards set in Gebser and Davis, diverging on the nature and amount of evidence sufficient to support a claim. In each of the last several presidential administrations, the Department of Education (ED) issued a number of guidance documents that instruct schools on their responsibilities under Title IX when addressing allegations of sexual harassment. These documents—while sometimes subject to change—generally reflected a different standard than the Supreme Court case law addressing private rights of action for damages for sexual abuse or harassment (the Court in Davis acknowledged that the threshold for liability in a private right of action could be higher than the standard imposed in the administrative enforcement context). Those guidance documents had, among other things, established that sometimes a school could be held responsible for instances of sexual harassment by a teacher, irrespective of actual notice; and schools could be held responsible for student-on-student harassment if a \"responsible employee\" knew or should have known of the harassment (constructive notice). ED's previous guidance also instructed educational institutions that they sometimes could be responsible for responding to incidents of sexual harassment occurring off campus. ED also cautioned schools on the use of mediation to resolve allegations of sexual harassment. With regard to the procedures used by schools to resolve sexual harassment allegations, ED informed schools that they must use the preponderance of the evidence standard to establish culpability, and the agency strongly discouraged schools from allowing parties in a hearing to personally cross-examine one another. In response to guidance from ED, as well as increased oversight from the department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) between 2011 and 2016, schools developed several procedures to ensure that their responses to allegations of sexual harassment and assault complied with Title IX. A number of students faced with disciplinary action by public universities raised constitutional challenges to the Title IX procedures used to find them responsible for sexual misconduct, arguing that universities violated the Due Process Clause in handling their case. ED issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in late 2018, after revoking some of its previous guidance to schools in 2017. The proposed regulations would, in several ways, tether the administrative requirements for schools to the standard set by the Supreme Court in Gebser and Davis. In doing so, the proposed regulations would depart from the standards set by ED in previous guidance documents (some of which have since been rescinded). The new regulations would require \"actual notice,\" rather than constructive notice, of harassment by an education institution to trigger a school's Title IX responsibilities, and provide that a school's response to allegations of sexual harassment will violate Title IX only if it amounts to deliberate indifference. In addition, the new regulations would more narrowly define what conduct qualifies as sexual harassment under Title IX, and also impose new procedural requirements, which appear to reflect due process concerns, when schools investigate sexual harassment or assault allegations and make determinations of culpability."], "all_classes": null, "length": 14692}
{"pred": " The National Science Foundation (NSF) utilizes two programs to bring in rotators: the IPA (Interagency Personnel Act) program and the VSEE (Voluntary Selective Exchange) program.

IPA rotators are employed by their home institutions and have their salaries and benefits covered by the home institution, with NSF reimbursing cost-sharing amounts. VSEE rotators are federal employees on leave from their home institutions, with NSF covering their salaries and reimbursing benefits. Both programs offer reimbursement for moving expenses and per diem allowances. The report highlights that IPA rotators can have salaries exceeding federal limits, while VSEE rotators are capped at federal maximums.

Benefits include fresh perspectives and close connections to the scientific community, while challenges include staffing turnover and higher costs for some rotators compared with permanent employees.

This report examines (1) the number, costs, and uses of NSF rotators for fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2017; (2) the strategies NSF has used to manage rotator costs and the results of these efforts; and (3) the extent to which NSF has a workforce strategy for using rotators and has evaluated the results of its rotator programs. GAO analyzed summary-level data on NSF's rotators; reviewed key documents; interviewed NSF officials; conducted semistructured interviews with a nongeneralizable sample of rotators and permanent federal employees selected from different scientific directorates within NSF; and compared NSF's management of the program to key principles for effective strategic workforce planning. The numbers of rotators—outside scientists, engineers, and educators on temporary assignment—at the National Science Foundation (NSF) and their costs in proportion to other staff remained relatively stable in fiscal years 2008 through 2017. Most rotators joined NSF under its Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) mobility program. IPA rotators comprised about 12 percent of NSF's workforce and 17 percent of staff costs on average and were not subject to a federal salary cap. They remain employees of their home institutions, with NSF reimbursing the institutions for most of their salaries and benefits. The remaining rotators are considered temporary federal employees under the Visiting Scientist, Engineer, and Educator (VSEE) program; their salaries could not exceed the federal maximum for their positions. Beginning in fiscal year 2017, NSF adopted IPA rotator program cost management strategies expected to achieve the greatest savings with the least harm to recruitment, but NSF officials said it is too soon to determine the full results. For example, for new IPA rotators who had not yet begun negotiating their assignments, NSF began requiring their home institutions to pay for 10 percent of the rotators' salary and benefits. NSF officials told GAO they expect to issue a report evaluating the strategies in December 2018. NSF's IPA program steering committee recommended developing a workforce strategy for balancing the agency's use of rotators with federal staff, but as of June 2018, NSF had not developed a strategy or fully evaluated the IPA and VSEE rotator programs' results, as called for by GAO's key principles for effective strategic workforce planning. NSF officials said they recognized the value of a workforce strategy but were focusing instead on other workforce planning efforts, and they had not fully evaluated program results in part because rotators are blended into the agency's permanent workforce, making a separate evaluation difficult. Without a workforce strategy and evaluation of results, NSF is limited in its ability to manage and, if warranted, adjust its use of rotators.

On a national basis, some key characteristics of owner-occupied housing markets and the mortgage market in recent years include increasing housing prices, low mortgage interest rates, and home sales that have been increasing but constrained by a limited inventory of homes on the market. Key characteristics of rental housing markets include an increasing number of renters, low rental vacancy rates, and increasing rents. Rising home prices and rents that have outpaced income growth in recent years have led to policymakers and others increasingly raising concerns about the affordability of both owner-occupied and rental housing.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this detailed report about U.S. corporate tax inversions. Let me start by understanding the main points. The report discusses how U.S. corporations can invert their headquarters to reduce taxes, the legislative responses to this, and the impact of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n\nFirst, the report explains that the U.S. taxes worldwide income of corporations, which can be a disadvantage compared to countries with territorial systems. Inversions allow companies to move to countries with lower tax rates, like the UK or Ireland. The report mentions different methods of inversion: substantial business activity, mergers with larger or smaller foreign firms, and naked inversions. \n\nThe American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (JOBS Act) tried to curb inversions by requiring ownership continuity and substantial business operations in the new country. However, companies found loopholes, leading to more inversions. The Treasury Department then issued regulations to close these loopholes, like increasing the business activity threshold and restricting ownership percentages. \n\nIn 2014, there was a wave of inversions, but the Treasury's regulations slowed them down. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) made significant changes, including a lower corporate tax rate (21%) and new international tax rules like GILTI and FDII. The TCJA also introduced measures to prevent inversions, such as taxing accumulated foreign earnings and adjusting ownership rules. \n\nThe report also discusses the impact of these changes, noting a decline in inversions post-2017. However, some companies still managed to invert by keeping ownership below 60%. The TCJA's provisions, like the deemed repatriation of earnings and the BEAT tax, aim to limit the benefits of inversions. \n\nThe summary should highlight the evolution of inversion strategies, legislative responses, the role of the TCJA, and the ongoing challenges. I need to make sure to mention key acts, the methods of inversion, the regulatory changes, and the outcomes like reduced inversion activity. Also, note the debate around tax rates and territorial systems. Keep it concise, one page, so I'll need to be brief but cover all major points without getting too detailed.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of the report. Let me start by outlining the key points. The report discusses U.S. corporate tax inversions, which are strategies companies use to reduce their tax liabilities by", "answers": ["News reports in the late 1990s and early 2000s drew attention to a phenomenon sometimes called corporate \"inversions\" or \"expatriations\": instances where U.S. firms reorganize their structure so that the \"parent\" element of the group is a foreign corporation rather than a corporation chartered in the United States. The main objective of these transactions was tax savings, and they involved little to no shift in actual economic activity. Bermuda and the Cayman Islands (countries with no corporate income tax) were the locations of many of the newly created parent corporations. These types of inversions largely ended with the enactment of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (JOBS Act; P.L. 108-357), which denied the tax benefits of an inversion if the original U.S. stockholders owned 80% or more of the new firm. The act effectively ended shifts to tax havens where no real business activity took place. However, two avenues for inverting remained. The act allowed a firm to invert if it has substantial business operations in the country where the new parent was to be located; the regulations at one point set a 10% level of these business operations. Several inversions using the business activity test resulted in Treasury regulations in 2012 that increased the activity requirement to 25%, effectively closing off this method. Firms could also invert by merging with a foreign company if the original U.S. stockholders owned less than 80% of the new firm. If the original U.S. shareholders owned less than 60%, the firm was not considered as inverting. Two features made a country an attractive destination: a low corporate tax rate and a territorial tax system that did not tax foreign source income. The U.K. joined countries such as Ireland, Switzerland, and Canada as targets for inverting when it adopted a territorial tax in 2009. At the same time, the U.K. also lowered its rate (from 25% to 20% by 2015). Inverted firms could reduce worldwide taxes by stripping taxable earnings out of the new U.S. subsidiary, largely through allocating debt to that subsidiary. Soon after, several high-profile companies indicated an interest in merging with a non-U.S. headquartered company, including Pfizer, Chiquita, AbbVie, and Burger King. This \"second wave\" of inversions again raised concerns about an erosion of the U.S. tax base. Chiquita and AbbVie canceled their plans in the wake of 2014 Treasury regulations, but Burger King and other firms completed merger plans. Pfizer subsequently terminated its planned merger with Allergan after Treasury regulations issued in 2016. Evidence suggests that these Treasury regulations have been an important factor in subsequently decreasing these merger-related inversions. Two policy options had been discussed in response: a general reform of the U.S. corporate tax and specific provisions to deal with tax-motivated international mergers. In December 2017, P.L. 115-97 (popularly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) lowered the corporate tax rate as part of broader tax reform which some argued would slow the rate of inversions. Other tax reform proposals suggested that if the United States moved to a territorial tax, the incentive to invert would be eliminated. There were concerns that a territorial tax could worsen the profit-shifting that already exists among multinational firms. P.L. 115-97, while moving in some ways to a territorial tax, also instituted a number of measures aimed at combatting profit shifting, including a global minimum tax on intangible income that limited the tax benefits of a territorial tax. The second option is to directly target inversions. The 2017 act included several provisions that discouraged inversions. In addition, further anti-inversion provisions have been introduced, most recently H.R. 5108 and S. 2459 in the 115th Congress, to treat all firms in which former U.S. shareholders have more than 50% ownership (or in which management and control is in the United States) as U.S. firms. These bills also provided that debt could also be allocated to the U.S. member of a worldwide operation in proportion to the U.S. ownership of assets."], "all_classes": null, "length": 9230}

The report compares the costs of a UN peacekeeping operation, specifically MINUSCA in the Central African Republic, with a hypothetical U.S. operation. The key findings are that the U.S. operation would cost nearly double the UN's $2.4 billion over three years.

Let me start by identifying the main points. The report compares the costs of the UN's MINUSCA operation in the Central African Republic with a hypothetical U.S. operation. The key findings are that the U.S. operation would cost nearly $5.7 billion, more than twice the UN's $2.4 billion over three years. The reasons for the higher U.S. costs include differences in staffing, logistics, facilities, intelligence, and medical standards. The U.S. also has faster deployment and better command and control, but the UN benefits from international acceptance and multilateral support. The report was conducted by GAO, using data from the UN, DOD", "answers": ["To promote international peace and security, the UN had 16 ongoing peacekeeping operations worldwide as of June 30, 2017, with a total budget of almost $8 billion in UN fiscal year 2017 and contributions of over 100,000 military, police, and civilian personnel from more than 120 countries. The United States is the largest financial contributor to UN peacekeeping operations, providing an average of about 28 percent of total funding annually. The Department of State Authorities Act, Fiscal Year 2017, includes a provision for GAO to compare the costs, strengths, and limitations of UN and U.S. peacekeeping operations. This report (1) compares the reported costs of a specific UN operation to the estimated costs of a hypothetical, comparable operation implemented by the United States; (2) identifies factors that affect cost differences; and (3) identifies stakeholder views on the relative strengths of UN and U.S. peacekeeping operations. GAO worked with the UN, DOD, and State to generate a cost estimate of a hypothetical U.S.-led operation in the Central African Republic comparable to MINUSCA. GAO developed this estimate using DOD's cost estimating tool for contingency operations and State data on civilian costs, assuming a U.S. operation using roughly the same levels of military and civilian personnel as MINUSCA. The cost estimate should not be construed as suggesting that the United States would likely implement such an operation in the Central African Republic or that it would implement such an operation in the same way. GAO is making no recommendations. Based on United Nations (UN) and Departments of Defense (DOD) and State (State) data, GAO estimates that it would cost the United States more than twice as much as it would cost the UN to implement a hypothetical operation comparable to the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA). MINUSCA cost the UN approximately $2.4 billion for the first 39 months of the operation. GAO estimates that a hypothetical U.S. peacekeeping operation in the Central African Republic of roughly the same size and duration would cost nearly $5.7 billion—almost eight times more than the $700 million the United States contributed to MINUSCA over the same time period. Various factors affect differences between the actual cost of MINUSCA and the estimated cost of a hypothetical, comparable U.S. operation in the Central African Republic. The United States and the UN would source and transport some supplies and equipment differently, affecting the cost of both operations; for example, the United States would airlift water into the Central African Republic, while the UN does not do so to the same extent. The United States also would incur the cost of civilian police and military reservist salaries, while the UN does not pay any troop or police salaries. Finally, some higher standards for facilities, intelligence, and medical services increase the U.S. cost estimate relative to UN costs for similar operational elements. UN and U.S. peacekeeping operations have various relative strengths, according to U.S. and UN officials. These officials said that, because the UN is a multilateral organization, UN peacekeeping operations have international acceptance and are more likely to be viewed as impartial. Officials also said that the UN enjoys global access to expertise and experience, and can leverage assistance from multilateral donors and development banks. Relative strengths of a U.S. peacekeeping operation would include faster deployment and superior command and control, logistics, intelligence, and counterterrorism capability, according to U.S. and UN officials."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5006}
{"pred": " The report provides an in-depth examination of the U.S. Small Business Administration's (SBA) size standards, which determine eligibility for federal assistance programs. Established under the Small Business Act of 1953, the SBA defines a small business as independently owned and operated, not dominant in its field, and meeting specific size criteria. These criteria include industry-specific standards based on employee count, annual receipts, or net worth, and are periodically reviewed to ensure they reflect current economic conditions.\n\nThe SBA uses two primary methods to determine small business eligibility: industry-specific size standards and alternative standards based on net worth and net income. Industry-specific standards are tailored to each of the 1,036 industrial classifications in the NAICS system, considering factors like market competition and firm size distribution. The SBA has also adopted a percentile-based approach to refine these standards, aligning them with industry-specific economic characteristics.\n\nOver the years, the SBA has faced challenges in defining small businesses due to the lack of a uniform definition and varying industry needs. Legislative actions, such as the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 and the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, have influenced the SBA's approach, requiring more frequent reviews and adjustments to size standards. These reviews aim to ensure that standards remain relevant and effective in promoting competition and supporting small businesses.\n\nThe report highlights the SBA's ongoing efforts to balance the need for accurate size standards with the practicalities of administration. It also discusses the impact of inflation on size standards and the SBA's commitment to adjusting them to maintain eligibility for small businesses. The SBA's size standards have been a subject of debate, with various stakeholders advocating for changes to better reflect the current economic landscape and support small business growth.\n\nThe SBA's size standards are crucial for federal contracting and assistance programs, and their evolution reflects the agency's response to changing economic conditions and legislative mandates.

Although there is bipartisan agreement that the nation's small businesses play an important role in the American economy, there are differences of opinion concerning how to define them. The Small Business Act of 1953 (P.L. 83-163, as amended) authorized the SBA to establish size standards to ensure that only small businesses receive SBA assistance. The SBA currently uses two types of size standards to determine SBA program eligibility: industry-specific size standards and alternative size standards based on the applicant's maximum tangible net worth and average net income after federal taxes. The SBA's industry-specific size standards determine program eligibility for firms in 1,036 industrial classifications in 23 sub-industry activities described in the 2017 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The size standards are based on one of four measures: (1) number of employees, (2) average annual receipts in the previous three (may soon be the previous five) years, (3) average asset size as reported in the firm's four quarterly financial statements for the preceding year, or (4) a combination of number of employees and barrel per day refining capacity. Overall, about 97% of all employer firms qualify as small under the SBA's size standards. These firms represent about 30% of industry receipts. The SBA conducts an analysis of various economic factors, such as each industry's overall competitiveness and the competitiveness of firms within each industry, to determine its size standards. However, in the absence of precise statutory guidance and consensus on how to define small, the SBA's size standards have often been challenged, typically by industry representatives seeking to increase the number of firms eligible for assistance and by Members concerned that the size standards may not adequately target assistance to firms that they consider to be truly small. This report provides a historical examination of the SBA's size standards and assesses competing views concerning how to define a small business. It also discusses P.L. 111-240, the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, which authorized the SBA to establish an alternative size standard using maximum tangible net worth and average net income after federal taxes for both the 7(a) and 504/CDC loan guaranty programs; established, until the SBA acted, an interim alternative size standard for the 7(a) and 504/CDC programs of not more than $15 million in tangible net worth and not more than $5 million in average net income after federal taxes (excluding any carry-over losses) for the two full fiscal years before the date of the application; and required the SBA to conduct a detailed review of not less than one-third of the SBA's industry size standards every 18 months beginning on the new law's date of enactment (September 27, 2010) and ensure that each size standard is reviewed at least once every five years. P.L. 112-239, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, which directed the SBA not to limit the number of size standards and to assign the appropriate size standard to each NAICS industrial classification. This provision addressed the SBA's practice of limiting the number of size standards it used and combining size standards within industrial groups as a means to reduce the complexity of its size standards and to provide greater consistency for industrial classifications that have similar economic characteristics. P.L. 114-328, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, which authorizes the SBA to establish different size standards for agricultural enterprises using existing methods and appeal processes. Previously, the small business size standard for agricultural enterprises was set in statute as having annual receipts not in excess of $750,000.

In 2017, U.S. plans and IRAs reportedly held investments worth nearly $17 trillion dollars. Federal law also allows individuals to withdraw assets from these accounts under certain circumstances. DOL and IRS oversee 401(k) plans, and collect annual plan data—including financial information—on the Form 5500. For both IRAs and 401(k) plans, GAO was asked to examine: (1) the incidence and amount of early withdrawals; (2) factors that might lead individuals to access retirement savings early; and (3) policies and strategies that might reduce the incidence and amounts of early withdrawals. To answer these questions, GAO analyzed data from IRS, the Census Bureau, and DOL from 2013 (the most recent complete data available); and interviewed a diverse range of stakeholders identified in the literature, including representatives of companies sponsoring 401(k) plans, plan administrators, subject matter experts, industry representatives, and participant advocates. In 2013 individuals in their prime working years (ages 25 to 55) removed at least $69 billion (+/- $3.5 billion) of their retirement savings early, according to GAO's analysis of 2013 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Department of Labor (DOL) data. Withdrawals from individual retirement accounts (IRA)—$39.5 billion (+/- $2.1 billion)—accounted for much of the money removed early, were equivalent to 3 percent (+/- 0.15 percent) of the age group's total IRA assets, and exceeded their IRA contributions in 2013. Participants in employer-sponsored plans, like 401(k) plans, withdrew at least $29.2 billion (+/- $2.8 billion) early as hardship withdrawals, lump sum payments made at job separation (known as cashouts), and loan balances that borrowers did not repay. Hardship withdrawals in 2013 were equivalent to about 0.5 percent (+/-0.06 percent) of the age group's total plan assets and about 8 percent (+/- 0.9 percent) of their contributions. However, the incidence and amount of certain unrepaid plan loans cannot be determined because the Form 5500—the federal government's primary source of information on employee benefit plans—does not capture these data. Stakeholders GAO interviewed identified flexibilities in plan rules and individuals' pressing financial needs, such as out-of-pocket medical costs, as factors affecting early withdrawals of retirement savings. Stakeholders said that certain plan rules, such as setting high minimum loan thresholds, may cause individuals to take out more of their savings than they need. Stakeholders also identified several elements of the job separation process affecting early withdrawals, such as difficulties transferring account balances to a new plan and plans requiring the immediate repayment of outstanding loans, as relevant factors. Stakeholders GAO interviewed suggested strategies they believed could balance early access to accounts with the need to build long-term retirement savings. For example, plan sponsors said allowing individuals to continue to repay plan loans after job separation, restricting participant access to plan sponsor contributions, allowing partial distributions at job separation, and building emergency savings features into plan designs, could help preserve retirement savings (see figure). However, they noted, each strategy involves tradeoffs, and the strategies' broader implications require further study.

Although Georgia faces high rates of poverty and underemployment, its economy in 2017 and 2018 appeared to show stronger growth than it had in the previous four years. The GD led a coalition to victory in parliamentary elections in 2012 amid growing dissatisfaction with the former ruling party, Mikheil Saakashvili's center-right United National Movement, which came to power as a result of Georgia's 2003 Rose Revolution. In August 2008, Russia went to war with Georgia to prevent Saakashvili's government from reestablishing control over the regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which broke away from Georgia in the early 1990s and became informal Russian protectorates.

Spinal cord injuries can lead to severe complications such as autonomic dysreflexia, depression, pressure ulcers, and spasticity, while brain injuries may result in cognitive and behavioral changes. These injuries often require specialized, long-term care, which is typically provided by LTCHs and IRFs. The report highlights the Medicare payment policies for LTCHs, which have undergone changes since the Pathway for SGR Reform Act of 2013, introducing a two-tiered payment system. Under this system, some discharges are paid at a standard rate, while others are subject to a site-neutral rate. The report focuses on two qualifying LTCHs, Craig Hospital and Shepherd Center, which have been temporarily exempt from the site-neutral rate due to their specialized care for spinal cord and brain injury patients. The analysis of Medicare claims data shows that these hospitals treat a significant number of Medicare beneficiaries with complex conditions, often requiring long stays and specialized services. The report also examines the financial impact of the payment policies on these hospitals, using simulations to project potential changes in Medicare payments under different scenarios. The findings indicate that the site-neutral payment policy could reduce payments for these hospitals, potentially affecting the availability and quality of care. The report further notes that other LTCHs may adjust their patient mix to meet the criteria for the standard rate, which could lead to changes in the services they provide. The study emphasizes the importance of specialized care for patients with spinal cord and brain injuries, highlighting the unique challenges and needs of these patients compared to those treated in other post-acute care settings.

This report examines (1) the health care needs of Medicare beneficiaries who receive services from the two qualifying hospitals; (2) how Medicare LTCH payment polices could affect the two qualifying hospitals; and (3) how the two qualifying hospitals compare with other LTCHs and other facilities that may treat Medicare patients with similar conditions. GAO analyzed the most recently available Medicare claims and other data for the two qualifying hospitals and other facilities that treat patients with spinal cord injuries. GAO also interviewed HHS officials and stakeholders from the qualifying hospitals, other facilities that treat spinal cord patients, specialty associations, and others. GAO provided a draft of this report to HHS. HHS provided technical comments, which were incorporated as appropriate. We also provided the two qualifying hospitals summaries of information we collected from them, to confirm the accuracy of statements included in our draft report. We incorporated their comments, as appropriate. Spinal cord injuries may result in secondary complications that often lead to decreased functional independence and quality of life. The 21st Century Cures Act changed how Medicare pays certain long-term care hospitals (LTCH) that provide spinal cord specialty treatment. For these hospitals, the act included a temporary exception from how Medicare pays other LTCHs. Two LTCHs—Craig Hospital in Englewood, Colorado and Shepherd Center in Atlanta, Georgia—have qualified for this exception. GAO found that most Medicare beneficiaries treated at these two hospitals typically receive specialized care for multiple chronic conditions and other long-term complications that develop after initial injuries, such as pressure ulcers that can result in life-threatening infection. The two hospitals also provide specialty care for acquired brain injuries, such as traumatic brain injuries. GAO's simulations of Medicare payments to these two hospitals using claims data from two baseline years—fiscal years 2013 and 2016—illustrate potential effects of payment policies. LTCHs are paid under a two-tiered system for care provided to beneficiaries: they receive the LTCH standard federal payment rate—or standard rate—for certain patients discharged from the LTCH, and a generally lower rate—known as a “site-neutral” rate—for all other discharges. Under the temporary exception, Craig Hospital and Shepherd Center receive the standard rate for all discharges during fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Assuming their types of discharges remain the same as in fiscal years 2013 and 2016, GAO's simulations of Medicare payments in the baseline years indicate: Most of the discharges we examined would not qualify for the standard rate, if the exception did not apply. Medicare payments would generally decrease under fiscal year 2020 payment policy, once the exception expires. However, the actual effects of Medicare's payment policies on these two hospitals could vary based on factors, including the severity of patient conditions (e.g., Medicare payment is typically higher for more severe injuries), and whether hospitals' discharges meet criteria for the standard rate. Similarities and differences may exist between the two qualifying hospitals and other facilities that treat Medicare patients with spinal cord and brain injuries. Patients with spinal cord and brain injuries may receive care in other LTCHs, but GAO found that most Medicare beneficiaries at these other LTCHs are treated for conditions other than spinal cord and brain injuries. Certain inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRF) also provide post-acute rehabilitation services to patients with spinal cord and brain injuries. While data limitations make a direct comparison between these facilities and the two qualifying hospitals difficult, GAO identified some similarities and differences. For example, officials from some IRFs we interviewed reported providing several of the same programs and services as the two qualifying hospitals to medically complex patients, but the availability of services and complexity of patients varied. Among other reasons, the different Medicare payment requirements that apply to LTCHs and IRFs affect the types of services they provide and the patients they treat."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8494}

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report starts by explaining the history of Congressional Gold Medals, dating back to the late 1700s. The first ones were issued by the Continental Congress, and they were meant to honor distinguished contributions, patriotism, and significant events. The report mentions that there are no permanent statutory provisions for these medals, so they're created through special legislative actions. The first medal was given to George Washington in 1776, and over time, the scope expanded beyond military achievements to include non-military contributions, like civil rights, science, and the arts. \n\nThere's a lot about the process of creating these medals. The report talks about how bills are introduced, referred to committees, and the requirements for cosponsors. The House and Senate have different rules, with the Senate requiring 67 cosponsors for committee consideration. The House has no set rules but sometimes had a requirement in the past. The report also mentions that there's no limit on the number of medals per year, but there have been proposals to limit them to maintain prestige. \n\nDesign aspects are covered too. The Secretary of the Treasury works with the Citizens Coinage Advisory Commission and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts to determine the design. The medals are usually given to the Smithsonian or an organization representing the group. \n\nThe summary needs to be concise, so I should highlight the history, the process, the expansion of the medal's scope, the legislative procedures, and the design considerations. Also, mention the current number of medals awarded and the debate around limiting their number. I need to make sure it's all in one page, double-spaced, with 12-point font and 1-inch margins. Let me structure this into paragraphs: introduction, history, process, design, current practices, and future considerations. Avoid too much detail but cover all main points. Check for any key examples like the first medals, notable recipients, and the role of committees. Make sure to mention that there's no statutory limit, but there's been a proposal to limit them. Also, note that the medals are considered the highest civilian honor. Alright, time to put this all together clearly and concisely.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of the report on Congressional", "answers": ["Senators and Representatives are frequently asked to support or sponsor proposals recognizing historic events and outstanding achievements by individuals or institutions. Among the various forms of recognition that Congress bestows, the Congressional Gold Medal is often considered the most distinguished. Through this venerable tradition—the occasional commissioning of individually struck gold medals in its name—Congress has expressed public gratitude on behalf of the nation for distinguished contributions for more than two centuries. Since 1776, this award, which initially was bestowed on military leaders, has also been given to such diverse individuals as Sir Winston Churchill and Bob Hope, George Washington and Robert Frost, Joe Louis and Mother Teresa of Calcutta. Congressional gold medal legislation generally has a specific format. Once a gold medal is authorized, it follows a specific process for design, minting, and awarding. This process includes consultation and recommendations by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Commission (CCAC) and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (CFA), pursuant to any statutory instructions, before the Secretary of the Treasury makes the final decision on a gold medal's design. Once the medal has been struck, a ceremony will often be scheduled to formally award the medal to the recipient. In recent years, the number of gold medals awarded has increased, and some have expressed interest in examining the gold medal awarding process. Should Congress want to make such changes, several individual and institutional options might be available. The individual options include decisions made by Members of Congress as to what individual or groups might be honored; potential specification of gold medal design elements; and where gold medals for groups might be housed once the award is made. The institutional options could include House, Senate, or committee rules for the consideration of gold medal legislation and whether statutory standards on the number of gold medals issued per year or per Congress might be established for gold medals."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3411}

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nFirst, the report talks about Cobra Dane and other radar systems like LRDR contributing to various missions: ballistic missile defense, space surveillance, and intelligence-gathering. The DOD uses these radars to track missile threats, classify them, and determine if they were intercepted. Some radars, like Cobra Dane, can also discriminate between real warheads and decoys. \n\nThe report mentions that Cobra Dane is operated by the Air Force, specifically Air Force Space Command since 2013, with the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center handling sustainment. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) works with the Air Force and combatant commands on missile defense assets. U.S. Northern Command and U.S. Strategic Command set priorities for radar infrastructure and missions. \n\nThere's a part about the Air Force's 2018 report to Congress that discussed Cobra Dane and LRDR's capabilities. The report had an error stating both radars could determine if a threat was intercepted, but MDA clarified that Cobra Dane doesn't have this capability yet and might in 2025. LRDR has unique discrimination capabilities once operational. \n\nThe locations of the radars are important. Cobra Dane at Shemya Island allows earlier tracking of North Korean missiles compared to LRDR at Clear Air Force Station. The MDA analysis showed Cobra Dane can track threats 210 seconds earlier, giving more time for intercepts. LRDR's location offers advantages for tracking threats closer to the U.S. and handling North Korean and Iranian threats. \n\nThe report also mentions other radar investments like the Pacific Radar and Space Fence that might reduce reliance on Cobra Dane. The Space Fence is expected to take over space surveillance, while the Pacific Radar could cover Cobra Dane's gap. However, Cobra Dane is still needed for some missions, especially space surveillance, as it tracks unique objects that others can't. \n\nOperational availability of Cobra Dane has declined slightly, but it's still above the 90% requirement. The Air Force uses the Sea-Based X-band radar as a backup during downtime. Funding for Cobra Dane's sustainment is shared between the Air Force and MDA, with plans for modernization projects. The report also notes challenges in replacing obsolete parts and the need for funding for future projects.\n\nI need to condense all this into", "answers": ["First fielded in 1976 on Shemya Island in Alaska, the Cobra Dane radar faces growing sustainment challenges that DOD plans to address through modernization projects. Anticipating future needs, DOD began investing in new radar systems that share capabilities with Cobra Dane to support ballistic missile defense and space surveillance, including the LRDR (Alaska), the Space Fence (Marshall Islands), and the Pacific Radar (location to be determined). The conference report accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision that GAO review the Air Force's report to Congress on the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane. This report identifies information included in the Air Force's report and describes additional information that GAO reviewed on (1) the capabilities of the Cobra Dane radar and other planned radars to meet DOD's mission requirements, (2) Cobra Dane's operational availability and the plan to mitigate the effect on those missions when Cobra Dane is not available, and (3) DOD's funding plan and project cost estimates for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane and its site at Shemya Island. GAO reviewed the Air Force report and related documentation, and interviewed relevant officials. In its January 2018 report to Congress, the Air Force reported how the Cobra Dane radar and the Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) have shared and unique capabilities to support ballistic missile defense and space surveillance missions. The report noted that the respective locations of both radar systems affect their ability to provide those capabilities. The Department of Defense (DOD) also has other radar investments—the Pacific Radar and the Space Fence, which, according to DOD officials, may reduce DOD's reliance on Cobra Dane to provide ballistic missile defense and space surveillance capabilities. The Air Force's report to Congress noted that Cobra Dane met its requirement for operational availability, which refers to the percentage of time that the radar is able to meet its missions. GAO found that the Air Force has developed procedures to mitigate risks when Cobra Dane is not available. For example, U.S. Northern Command and Missile Defense Agency (MDA) officials stated that they can mitigate risks when Cobra Dane is not available by using the Sea-Based X-band radar to provide support for ballistic missile defense. The Air Force would face some limitations in its ability to conduct space surveillance if Cobra Dane were not available, as Cobra Dane tracks objects no other radar can track. However, MDA officials noted there are no plans to take Cobra Dane offline long enough to compromise space surveillance. The Air Force and MDA plan to contribute total funding of $278.6 million for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane, according to their fiscal year 2019 budget plans. Specifically, the Air Force and MDA plan to share funding for the operation and maintenance of the Cobra Dane radar and for three modernization projects that make up their sustainment plan for the radar. Further, the Air Force report noted that the Air Force also plans to provide $140 million in funding for the sustainment and maintenance of operational access to Cobra Dane's site at Shemya Island. In addition, GAO found that the Air Force developed a total cost estimate for one project—known as the transmitter group replacement—but not for its other two projects.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this DEA report. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points. \n\nThe report is about the DEA's role in regulating the disposal of unused controlled substances. The Disposal Act of 2010 allowed the public to dispose of unused prescriptions through authorized collectors like pharmacies and hospitals. DEA is responsible for creating regulations for this, which include disposal bins, mail-back programs, and take-back events. The regulations are designed to prevent diversion while considering public health and safety, cost, and community participation.\n\nThe report mentions that eligible entities need to modify their DEA registration to become authorized collectors. They have to install secure disposal bins with specific requirements. The bins must be locked, have a small opening, and be monitored. The inner liners have to meet certain standards, and the collected substances must be destroyed in a non-retrievable way. \n\nThere's data on participation rates: about 2.5% of eligible entities became authorized collectors as of April 2017. Most are pharmacies, with some states like North Dakota having high participation due to state funding. However, participation varies by state and area, with rural areas having higher participation rates than urban ones. \n\nThe report also discusses challenges: costs of installation and maintenance, uncertainty about regulations, and conflicts with other state or federal laws. Stakeholders mentioned that costs are a big factor, and some states have funding programs. Also, some entities are already using other disposal methods, so they don't see the need for DEA bins. \n\nDEA officials say they don't collect data on usage or amounts disposed, only that they provide the opportunity for entities to become collectors. They also mention that they provide guidance through their website and training, but there have been issues with communication in the past. \n\nI need to condense all this into a one-page summary. Start with the main purpose of the report, the Disposal Act, DEA's role, the disposal methods, the participation rates, challenges, and the DEA's response. Make sure to highlight key statistics like the 2.5% participation, North Dakota's high rate, and the reasons for low participation. Also mention the lack of data on usage and the factors affecting participation. Keep it concise, maybe 3-4 paragraphs. Avoid jargon, use clear language.

About half of the people who reported misusing prescription drugs in 2015 received them from a friend or relative. One way to help prevent this kind of diversion and potential misuse is by providing secure and convenient ways to dispose of unused, unneeded, or expired prescription medications. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 authorizes pharmacies and other entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances to also collect unused prescription drugs for disposal. In 2014, DEA finalized regulations for the implementation of the Act, establishing a voluntary process for eligible entities to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs using disposal bins. GAO was asked to review participation among authorized collectors that maintain disposal bins. In this report GAO describes (1) participation rates among entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs and (2) factors that affect participation. GAO analyzed the most currently available DEA data from April 2017 on entities eligible to participate and those participating as authorized collectors. GAO also conducted interviews with DEA officials and a nongeneralizable sample of 11 stakeholder organizations selected to illustrate different types of authorized collectors and long-term care facilities. GAO is not making any recommendations. DEA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. GAO found that about 3 percent of pharmacies and other entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs for disposal have volunteered to do so. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) authorizes these entities to dispose of unused drugs to help reduce their potential misuse. Analysis of DEA data shows that as of April 2017, 2,233 of the 89,550 (2.49 percent) eligible entities—that is, certain entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances—had registered with DEA to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. Most—about 81 percent—of the authorized collectors were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics. GAO also found that participation rates varied by state, though in 44 states less than 5 percent of the state's pharmacies and other eligible entities had registered to become authorized collectors. Stakeholders cited several factors that may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have registered with DEA as authorized collectors of unused drugs. Most notably, stakeholders representing authorized collectors told GAO that because participation is voluntary, the cost associated with maintaining a disposal bin—which includes purchasing and installing the bin according to DEA requirements and paying for the destruction of its contents—is an important factor to weigh against potential benefits. DEA noted that availability of disposal by law enforcement agencies also contributes to low participation."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2930}

It mentions that there are two main ways: special rules and suspension motions. Suspension is used for broadly supported bills, while special rules handle more contentious ones. Most bills are under suspension, which requires a two-thirds vote. The process involves waiving points of order, limiting debate, and no floor amendments. The report also talks about the statistics from the 114th Congress, like 62% of floor actions were under suspension. It breaks down the types of measures, sponsors, committees involved, debate times, and voting outcomes.

The report explains the House's suspension of the rules procedure, which allows non-privileged measures to be considered without a special rule. It requires a two-thirds vote, is used for broadly supported bills, and waives debate and amendments. Most bills (62%) in the 114th Congress were under suspension. The process involves floor managers, limited debate (40 minutes), and possible amendments. The report includes stats on sponsors, committees, and outcomes. I need to condense this into a concise summary. Let me structure it with an introduction, procedure, statistics, outcomes, and conclusion. Make sure to mention the key figures like 62", "answers": ["Suspension of the rules is the most commonly used procedure to call up measures on the floor of the House of Representatives. As the name suggests, the procedure allows the House to suspend its standing and statutory rules in order to consider broadly supported legislation in an expedited manner. More specifically, the House temporarily sets aside its rules that govern the raising and consideration of measures and assumes a new set of constraints particular to the suspension procedure. The suspension of the rules procedure has several parliamentary advantages: (1) it allows nonprivileged measures to be raised on the House floor without the need for a special rule, (2) it enables the consideration of measures that would otherwise be subject to a point of order, and (3) it streamlines floor action by limiting debate and prohibiting floor amendments. Given these features, as well as the required two-thirds supermajority vote for passage, suspension motions are generally used to process less controversial legislation. In the 114th Congress (2015-2016), measures considered under suspension made up 62% of the bills and resolutions that received floor action in the House (743 out of 1,200 measures). The majority of suspension measures were House bills (83%), followed by Senate bills (11%) and House resolutions (4%). The measures covered a variety of policy areas but most often addressed government operations, such as the designation of federal facilities or amending administrative policies. Most measures that are considered in the House under the suspension procedure are sponsored by a House or Senate majority party member. However, suspension is the most common House procedure used to consider minority-party-sponsored legislation regardless of whether the legislation originated in the House or Senate. In 2015 and 2016, minority-party members sponsored 31% of suspension measures, compared to 9% of legislation subject to different procedures, including privileged business (17 measures), unanimous consent (21 measures), and under the terms of a special rule (one Senate bill). Most suspension measures are referred to at least one House committee before their consideration on the floor. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform (now called the Committee on Oversight and Reform) was the committee of primary jurisdiction for the plurality of suspension measures considered in the 114th Congress. Additional committees—such as Energy and Commerce, Homeland Security, Natural Resources, Foreign Affairs, and Veterans' Affairs—also served as the primary committee for a large number of suspension measures. Suspension motions are debatable for up to 40 minutes. In most cases, only a fraction of that debate time is actually used. In the 114th Congress, the average amount of time spent considering a motion to suspend the rules was 13 minutes and 10 seconds. The House adopted nearly every suspension motion considered in 2015 and 2016. Approval by the House, however, did not guarantee final approval in the 114th Congress. The Senate passed or agreed to 40% of the bills, joint resolutions, and concurrent resolutions initially considered in the House under suspension of the rules, and 276 measures were signed into law.

The agency has adjusted its policies, such as lowering the threshold for establishing new national cemeteries from 170,000 to 80,000 unserved veterans, to better meet the needs of veterans in underserved areas. NCA’s plan includes establishing 18 new national cemeteries—five traditional, five urban initiative, and eight rural initiative—aimed at increasing burial access for veterans. However, progress has been limited due to delays in opening these sites, with only six of the planned 18 sites open as of September 2019. Key challenges include land acquisition, cost estimation, and data usage for targeting unserved populations. NCA has faced significant cost overruns, with some rural initiative sites’ costs increasing by over 200% from initial estimates. The agency’s cost-estimating guidance does not fully incorporate best practices from the GAO Cost Guide, leading to potential reliability issues. Additionally, NCA relies on county-level population data to identify unserved areas, but using more precise census tract data could improve targeting.

Within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) has a plan to establish 18 new national cemeteries to increase reasonable access to burial options for veterans. NCA defines reasonable access as a national or state veterans' cemetery being located within 75 miles of veterans' homes. Key parts of NCA's plan include establishing 13 urban and rural initiative national cemeteries and awarding grant funds to state applicants for establishing new state veterans' cemeteries. NCA has made limited progress in implementing its plan to increase burial access and is years behind its original schedule for opening new cemeteries. For example, NCA has opened only two of its planned urban and rural initiative sites and is behind its original schedule for the other 11 (see fig. below). The primary factor delaying NCA's completion of these cemeteries has been challenges in acquiring suitable land. NCA has also been challenged in producing accurate estimates of construction costs for most of its rural initiative sites. Cost estimates have increased more than 200 percent (from about $7 million to $24 million) for these sites, and NCA's guidance for developing cost estimates for the cemeteries does not fully incorporate the 12 steps identified in cost-estimating leading practices—such as conducting a risk and uncertainty analysis or a sensitivity analysis. As a result, NCA is not well positioned to provide reliable and valid cost estimates to better inform decisions to enhance veterans' cemetery access.

Funding is another key aspect—HAVA provides", "answers": ["The administration of elections in the United States is highly decentralized. Elections are primarily administered by thousands of state and local systems rather than a single, unified national system. States and localities share responsibility for most election administration duties. Exactly how responsibilities are assigned at the state and local levels varies both between and within states, but there are some general patterns in the distribution of duties. States typically have primary responsibility for making decisions about the rules of elections (policymaking). Localities typically have primary responsibility for conducting elections in accordance with those rules (implementation). Localities, with varying contributions from states, typically also have primary responsibility for paying for the activities and resources required to conduct elections (funding). The structures of the state and local systems that conduct elections also vary between and within states. Common variations include differences related to the leadership of the system, the relationship between local election officials and the state, and the population size and density of the jurisdiction the system serves. The leadership of a state or local election system may be elected or appointed, and both the leaders and the methods used to select them may be partisan, bipartisan, or nonpartisan. State officials may have more or less direct influence over local election officials, and the extent of their influence may be affected by other structural features of the state's election systems, such as the methods used to select local officials. Finally, larger election jurisdictions have different administrative advantages and challenges than smaller ones, and more urban jurisdictions have different advantages and challenges than more rural ones. These differences between jurisdictions may be reflected in structural features of the election systems that serve them, such as how the systems allocate resources and where they find specialized expertise. Understanding the duties and structures of state and local election systems may be relevant to Congress for at least two reasons. First, the way state and local election systems work can affect how well federal action on election administration serves its intended purposes. The effectiveness of federal action depends in part on how it is implemented. How it is implemented can depend, in turn, on how the state and local election systems that implement it work. Second, Congress can make or incentivize changes to the way state and local election systems work. Congress has a number of policy tools it can use to affect the administration of federal elections. The use of these tools can—either intentionally or unintentionally—affect the state and local election systems that administer federal elections."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3965}

Despite this, these fatalities account for less than 1% of all highway-related fatalities. The decline in crashes and fatalities occurred as train and highway traffic volumes increased, and the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) expects these volumes to continue rising, potentially leading to an increase in crashes and fatalities.\n\nThe Section 130 Program, a set-aside portion of the Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP), provides federal funds to states for grade-crossing safety improvements. States determine the projects, with federal funds covering 90% of the costs, and states contributing the remaining 10%. The program requires at least 50% of funds to be used for protective devices like warning lights and gates. States have up to four years to obligate funds, and they can combine funds from multiple years for larger projects. The program's requirements include establishing an implementation schedule for safety improvements, with a focus on active and passive grade crossings.\n\nThe Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) oversees the Section 130 Program, ensuring states use funds appropriately. FRA, on the other hand, focuses on rail safety, including grade-crossing warning systems and conducting inspections. FRA has created new grade-crossing inspectors to enhance safety oversight and is exploring new technologies and safety measures to address driver behavior and improve pedestrian safety.\n\nStates use accident prediction models to prioritize projects, considering factors like traffic volume and accident history. However, challenges include limited funding, difficulty in measuring project effectiveness, and the need for local support for expensive projects like grade separation. The report highlights the importance of the Section 130 Program in funding safety improvements but notes that the program's requirements may hinder innovative approaches and the effectiveness of measuring outcomes.\n\nThe report also discusses the need for a comprehensive evaluation of the Section 130 Program to assess its effectiveness and determine if changes are necessary to better address current and emerging safety issues, particularly risky driver behavior. FHWA is encouraged to evaluate", "answers": ["Crashes at highway-rail grade crossings are one of the leading causes of railroad-related deaths. According to FRA data, in 2017, there were more than 2,100 crashes resulting in 273 fatalities. Since 2009 crashes have occurred at a fairly constant rate. The federal government provides states funding to improve grade-crossing safety through FHWA's Section 130 Program. The persistence of crashes and deaths raises questions about the effectiveness of the federal grade-crossing-safety program. GAO was asked to review federal efforts to improve grade-crossing safety. This report examines: (1) the focus of FRA's grade-crossing-safety research, (2) how states select and implement grade-crossing projects and what data are available from FRA to inform their decisions, and (3) the challenges states reported in implementing and assessing projects and the extent to which FHWA assesses the program's effectiveness. GAO analyzed FRA data; reviewed FRA's, FHWA's, and states' documents; reviewed a study of states' selection of projects; and interviewed FRA and FHWA headquarters and field staff, and officials from a non-generalizable sample of eight states, selected to include a mix in the number of grade crossings and crashes, and geographic diversity. Research sponsored by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has identified driver behavior as the main cause of highway-rail grade crossing crashes and that factors such as train and traffic volume can contribute to the risk of a crash. (See figure.) Over 70 percent of fatal crashes in 2017 occurred at grade crossings with gates. To meet the requirements of the federal grade-crossing program, states are responsible for selecting and ensuring the implementation of grade-crossing improvement projects. Most state DOT officials and other relevant transportation officials use local knowledge of grade crossings to supplement the results of models that rank grade crossings based on the risk of an accident. These states generally consider the same primary risk factors, such as vehicle and train traffic. FRA is taking steps to improve the data used in its model to help states assess risk factors at grade crossings. For example, FRA's grade-crossing inspectors will review and identify issues with railroad- and state-reported inventory data. FRA is currently developing guidelines, which it plans to finalize by the end of 2018, to implement these inspections as it has for other types of FRA inspections. Officials we spoke with in eight states reported challenges in pursuing certain types of projects that could further enhance safety, in part because of federal requirements. While safety has improved, many crashes occur at grade crossings with gates, and officials said there could be additional ways to focus program requirements to continue improving safety. States' and the Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) reporting focuses on the program's funding and activity, such as the number and types of projects, yet the low number of crashes makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of projects in reducing crashes and fatalities. FHWA reports the program has been effective in reducing fatalities by about 74 percent since 1975. However, since 2009, annually there have been about 250 fatalities—almost one percent of total highway fatalities. FRA expects future crashes to grow, in part, due to the anticipated increase in rail and highway traffic. An evaluation of the program should consider whether its funding and other requirements allow states to adequately address ongoing safety issues. FHWA officials said they are not required to perform such evaluations. GAO has previously reported on the importance of program evaluations to determine the extent to which a program is meeting its objectives. An evaluation of the program could lead FHWA to identify changes that could allow states to more strategically address problem areas. GAO recommends that FHWA evaluate the program's requirements to determine if they allow states the flexibility to address ongoing safety issues. The Department of Transportation concurred with GAO's recommendation."], "all_classes": null, "length": 7675}

It mentions the historical background, like George Washington creating the Badge of Military Merit in 1782, which later became the Purple Heart. Then there's the revival by MacArthur in 1932. The report also goes into detail about various legislative changes, like the NDAA in 2015 expanding eligibility to include attacks by foreign terrorist organizations. There are examples like the Fort Hood and Chattanooga shootings where Purple Hearts were awarded after legislative changes. \n\nThe report also discusses debates around expanding eligibility, especially for conditions like PTSD and TBI. Veterans groups have mixed opinions—some think PTSD should be included because it's a real injury, while others argue it's not combat-related. There's also mention of legislation like the \"Find our Hearts Act\" that aimed to create a database of Purple Heart recipients but didn't pass. \n\nOther points include the controversy over whether acts like the Oklahoma City bombing or the Orlando shooting qualify, and the issue of selling Purple Hearts, which led to some legislation. The report also notes that the Department of Defense doesn't track the exact number of recipients, but estimates are around 1.8 million. \n\nI need to condense all this into a one-page summary. Start with the purpose of the report, then the history of the Purple Heart, key legislative changes, current eligibility criteria, debates around expanding eligibility, and recent events.

Events over the past few years have spurred debate on the eligibility criteria for the Purple Heart. Shootings on U.S. soil and medical conditions such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have prompted changes to the eligibility requirements for the Purple Heart. Some critics believe that these changes may lessen the value of the medal and the sacrifices of past recipients on the battlefield. In the past, efforts to modify the Purple Heart's eligibility requirements were contentious, and veterans groups were vocal concerning eligibility changes. While medal requirements are often left to the military and executive branch to decide, Congress is involved in Purple Heart eligibility, utilizing its constitutional power \"To Make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces\" (U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8, clause 14). The Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (P.L. 113-291) included language that expands eligibility for the Purple Heart. Previous debates have raised several questions about the Purple Heart. In some respects, how an event is defined can determine eligibility: Is a servicemember the victim of a crime or a terrorist attack? Conversely, arguing that killed or wounded servicemembers \"should\" be eligible for the Purple Heart can redefine an event: Is the servicemember an advisor to a foreign military or a combatant? Are PTSD and other mental health conditions adequate injuries to warrant the Purple Heart?

The report outlines the structure and operations of the program, including the responsibilities of federal and state agencies, work requirements for recipients, and the role of SNAP E&T (Employment and Training) programs. Key points include:\n\n1. **Program Structure and Responsibilities**: FNS is responsible for setting SNAP regulations, authorizing retailers, and monitoring compliance. States handle eligibility determinations, benefit calculations, and program oversight. SNAP recipients must meet work requirements unless exempt, with specific rules for able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs), who face additional restrictions.\n\n2. **Work Requirements and Exemptions**: Most SNAP recipients aged 16-59 must comply with work requirements, including job searches, employment, or participation in work programs. ABAWDs must work 20 hours weekly or participate in work programs, with a 3-month benefit limit unless waived due to high unemployment or job scarcity.\n\n3. **SNAP E&T Programs**: These programs offer job training, education, and work experience to help recipients gain employment. States can operate voluntary or mandatory programs, with voluntary programs becoming more common. Federal funding includes 100% grants, 50% reimbursement, and ABAWD pledge funds. E&T participation has declined, with fewer participants in voluntary programs.\n\n4. **Fraud and Improper Payments**: SNAP faces challenges with fraud, including eligibility fraud and trafficking (exchanging benefits for cash). Improper payments totaled $2.6 billion in 2014, with income errors as a primary cause. FNS and states work to detect and prevent fraud through data monitoring, investigations, and penalties.\n\n5. **Retailer Oversight**: FNS authorizes and monitors retailers, with increased food stock requirements to deter trafficking. High-risk retailers are targeted for closer scrutiny, and penalties include disqualification or monetary fines. However, trafficking remains a concern, with ongoing efforts to improve detection and enforcement.\n\n6. **Program Integrity and Improvements**: FNS has enhanced oversight through technical assistance, guidance, and new tools for fraud detection. Efforts include developing a Fraud Framework, improving data analytics, and addressing staffing and resource challenges in state agencies.\n\nThe report highlights the complexity of managing SNAP, balancing support for recipients with ensuring program integrity, and the ongoing need for improvements in fraud prevention, work requirements, and E&T program effectiveness.\nOkay, I need", "answers": ["SNAP is the largest federally funded nutrition assistance program. In fiscal year 2017, it provided about $63 billion in benefits. USDA and the states jointly administer SNAP and partner to address issues that affect program integrity, including improper payments and fraud. GAO has previously reported on various aspects of SNAP, including state SNAP E&T programs, improper payment rates, recipient fraud, and retailer trafficking. This testimony discusses GAO's prior and ongoing work on (1) SNAP E&T programs, including program participants, design, and USDA oversight, and (2) USDA's efforts to address SNAP program integrity, including improper payments, as well as recipient and retailer fraud. As part of its ongoing work on SNAP E&T programs, GAO analyzed E&T expenditures and participation data from fiscal years 2007 through 2016, the most recent data available; reviewed relevant research from USDA; and interviewed USDA and selected state and local officials. The prior work discussed in this testimony is based on four GAO products on E&T programs (GAO-03-388), improper payments (GAO-16-708T), recipient fraud (GAO-14-641), and retailer trafficking (GAO-07-53). Information on the scope and methodology of our prior work is available in each product. Overseen by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and administered by states, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Employment and Training (E&T) programs served about 0.5 percent of the approximately 43.5 million SNAP recipients in an average month of fiscal year 2016, according to the most recent USDA data available. These programs are generally designed to help SNAP recipients increase their ability to obtain regular employment through services such as job search and training. Some recipients may be required to participate. According to USDA, about 14 percent of SNAP recipients were subject to work requirements in an average month of fiscal year 2016, while others, such as children and the elderly, were generally exempt from these requirements. States have flexibility in how they design their E&T programs. Over the last several years, states have 1) increasingly moved away from programs that mandate participation, 2) focused on serving able-bodied adults without dependents whose benefits are generally time-limited unless they comply with work requirements, and 3) partnered with state and local organizations to deliver services. USDA has taken steps to increase support and oversight of SNAP E&T since 2014, including collecting new data on participant outcomes from states. GAO has ongoing work reviewing SNAP E&T programs, including USDA oversight. USDA and the states partner to address issues that affect program integrity, including improper payments and fraud, and USDA has taken some steps to address challenges in these areas, but issues remain. Improper Payments. In 2016, GAO reviewed SNAP improper payment rates and found that states' adoption of program flexibilities and changes in federal SNAP policy in the previous decade, as well as improper payment rate calculation methods, likely affected these rates. Although USDA reported improper payment estimates for SNAP in previous years, USDA did not report an estimate for benefits paid in fiscal years 2015 or 2016 due to data quality issues in some states. USDA has since been working with the states to improve improper payment estimates for the fiscal year 2017 review. Recipient Fraud. In 2014, GAO made recommendations to USDA to address challenges states faced in combatting recipient fraud. For example, GAO found that USDA's guidance on the use of transaction data to uncover potential trafficking lacked specificity and recommended USDA develop additional guidance. Since then, USDA has provided technical assistance to some states, including on the use of data analytics. GAO has ongoing work reviewing states' use of data analytics to identify SNAP recipient fraud. Retailer Trafficking. In 2006, GAO identified several ways in which SNAP was vulnerable to retailer trafficking—a practice involving the exchange of benefits for cash or non-food items. For example, USDA had not conducted analyses to identify high-risk retailers and target its resources. Since then, USDA has established risk levels for retailers based on various factors. GAO has ongoing work assessing how USDA prevents, detects, and responds to retailer trafficking and reviewing the usefulness of USDA's estimates of the extent of SNAP retailer trafficking.

{"pred": " The report discusses the growing interest in liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a maritime fuel due to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) standards limiting sulfur emissions from ships. The IMO's 2020 sulfur standards require ships to use low-sulfur fuels or install scrubbers, which could increase fuel costs. LNG, as a bunker fuel, offers lower emissions and potential cost savings, but its adoption faces challenges such as infrastructure, safety, and regulatory issues. The report highlights the potential for LNG to create economic opportunities in the U.S. natural gas industry, shipbuilding, and port infrastructure. However, the market dynamics, including fuel prices and the volatility of LNG supply, remain uncertain. The U.S. has limited LNG bunkering operations, but there are opportunities for expansion, especially in ports near existing LNG terminals.

The report explains that the IMO's 2020 standards require ships to use low-sulfur fuels or install scrubbers, which could be costly. LNG is being considered as an alternative because it emits less sulfur and other pollutants. However, there are challenges like the need for specialized infrastructure, safety concerns, and regulatory issues. \n\nThe report also mentions the U.S. context, including the Jones Act and existing LNG bunkering facilities.

Safety and", "answers": ["The combination of growing liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies and new requirements for less polluting fuels in the maritime shipping industry has heightened interest in LNG as a maritime fuel. The use of LNG as an engine (\"bunker\") fuel in shipping is also drawing attention from federal agencies and is beginning to emerge as an issue of interest in Congress. In 2008, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) announced a timeline to reduce the maximum sulfur content in vessel fuels to 0.5% by January 1, 2020. Annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships requires vessels to either use fuels containing less than 0.5% sulfur or install exhaust-cleaning systems (\"scrubbers\") to limit a vessel's airborne emissions of sulfur oxides to an equivalent level. An option for vessel operators to meet the IMO 2020 standards is to install LNG-fueled engines, which emit only trace amounts of sulfur. Adopting LNG engines requires more investment than installing scrubbers, but LNG-fueled engines may offset their capital costs with operating cost advantages over conventional fuels. Savings would depend on the price spread between LNG and fuel oil. Recent trends suggest that LNG may be cheaper in the long run than conventional fuels. LNG bunkering requires specialized infrastructure for supply, storage, and delivery to vessels. To date, the number of ports worldwide that have developed such infrastructure is limited, although growth in this area has accelerated. Early adoption of LNG bunkering is occurring in Europe where the European Union requires a core network of ports to provide LNG bunkering by 2030. LNG bunkering is also advancing in Asia, led by Singapore, the world's largest bunkering port. Asian countries, together with Australia and the United Arab Emirates, have about 10 coastal ports offering LNG bunkering, with another 15 projects in development. LNG bunkering in the United States currently takes place in Jacksonville, FL, and Port Fourchon, LA—with a third facility under development in Tacoma, WA. Bunkering of LNG-fueled cruise ships using barges also is planned for Port Canaveral, FL. The relative locations of other U.S. ports and operating LNG terminals suggest that LNG bunkering could be within reach of every port along the Eastern Seaboard and in the Gulf of Mexico. On the West Coast, the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, CA, are near the Costa Azul LNG terminal in Ensenada, MX. Seattle and Tacoma are adjacent to the proposed Tacoma LNG project. Since 2015, Jones Act coastal ship operators have taken steps to transition their fleets to use cleaner burning fuels, including LNG. Shippers of dry goods to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico have taken delivery or have ordered LNG-fueled and LNG-capable vessels from U.S. shipyards in Philadelphia, PA, and Brownsville, TX. Another company operates five LNG-powered offshore supply vessels built in Gulfport, MS. Depending upon LNG conversions, the global LNG bunker fuel market could grow to several billion dollars by 2030. If U.S. LNG producers were to supply a significant share of this market—on the strength of comparatively low LNG production costs—LNG bunkering could increase demand for U.S. natural gas production, transportation, and liquefaction. Opportunities in LNG-related shipbuilding might be more limited, as most shipbuilding occurs overseas, although domestically-constructed LNG bunkering barges could be one area of economic growth. Finally, engineering and construction firms could benefit from new opportunities to develop port infrastructure for LNG storage and transfer. However, while vessel conversion to LNG fuel may increase demand for U.S.-produced natural gas, it partially could be offset by reduced demand for U.S.-produced crude oil or refined products. Furthermore, while LNG can reduce direct emissions from vessels, fugitive emissions and environmental impacts from natural gas production and transportation could reduce overall emissions benefits. While the LNG industry has experienced few accidents, the Coast Guard has been developing new standards to address unique safety and security risks associated with LNG in vessel operations. The overarching consideration about LNG bunkering in the United States is uncertainty about how the global shipping fleet will adapt to the IMO sulfur standards over time. This uncertainty complicates decisions related to both private investment and public policy. Although Congress has limited ability to influence global shipping, it could influence the growth of LNG bunkering through the tax code and regulation, or through policies affecting the LNG industry or domestic shipping industry as a whole. Evaluating the potential implications of LNG bunkering within the context of broader energy and environmental policies may become an additional consideration for Congress. If LNG bunkering expands significantly, Congress also may examine the adequacy of existing measures to ensure the safety and security of LNG vessels, storage, and related facilities."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8129}

It highlights that while 43% of school districts tested for lead in drinking water, 41% did not, and 16% were unaware of testing. Of those that tested, 37% found elevated lead levels, prompting remediation actions such as replacing fixtures, providing bottled water, and flushing systems. The report notes that larger districts and those in the Northeast were more likely to test, with 88% of the largest 100 districts testing compared to 42% of others. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) offers guidance, such as the 3Ts guidance, but it is not universally adopted or updated, leading to confusion among districts. The guidance recommends an action level of 20 ppb, which is not a health-based standard, and the report suggests that clearer guidance on action levels and testing schedules is needed. Federal agencies, including Education and EPA, have limited collaboration, and the report recommends improved communication and coordination to enhance lead testing and remediation efforts.

GAO was asked to review school practices for lead testing and remediation. This report examines the extent to which (1) school districts are testing for, finding, and remediating lead in drinking water; (2) states are supporting these efforts; and (3) federal agencies are supporting state and school district efforts. GAO administered a web-based survey to a stratified, random sample of 549 school districts, the results of which are generalizable to all school districts. GAO visited or interviewed officials with 17 school districts with experience in lead testing, spread among 5 states, selected for geographic variation. GAO also interviewed federal and state officials and reviewed relevant laws and documents. An estimated 43 percent of school districts, serving 35 million students, tested for lead in school drinking water in 2016 or 2017, according to GAO's nationwide survey of school districts. An estimated 41 percent of school districts, serving 12 million students, had not tested for lead. GAO's survey showed that, among school districts that did test, an estimated 37 percent found elevated lead (lead at levels above their selected threshold for taking remedial action.) (See figure.) All school districts that found elevated lead in drinking water reported taking steps to reduce or eliminate exposure to lead, including replacing water fountains, installing filters or new fixtures, or providing bottled water. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), at least 8 states have requirements that schools test for lead in drinking water as of 2017, and at least 13 additional states supported school districts' voluntary efforts with funding or in-kind support for testing and remediation. In addition, the five states GAO visited provided examples of technical assistance to support testing in schools. EPA provides guidance and other resources to states and school districts regarding testing and remediating lead in drinking water, and the Department of Education (Education) provides some of this information on its websites. School district officials that used EPA's written guidance said they generally found it helpful. Although EPA guidance emphasizes the importance of addressing elevated lead levels, GAO found that some aspects of the guidance, such as the threshold for taking remedial action, were potentially misleading and unclear, which can put school districts at risk of making uninformed decisions. In addition, many school districts reported a lack of familiarity with EPA's guidance, and their familiarity varied by region of the country. Education and EPA do not regularly collaborate to support state and school district efforts on lead in drinking water, despite agreeing to do so in a 2005 memorandum of understanding. Such collaboration could encourage testing and ensure that more school districts will have the necessary information to limit student and staff exposure to lead.

Under certain circumstances, DOD can enter into an other transaction (OT) agreement instead of a traditional contract. OT agreements are generally exempt from federal procurement laws and regulations. These exemptions grant government officials the flexibility to include, amend, or exclude contract clauses and requirements that are mandatory in traditional procurements (e.g., termination clauses, cost accounting standards, payments, audit requirements, intellectual property, and contract disputes). OT authorities also grant more flexibility to structure agreements in numerous ways, including joint ventures; partnerships; consortia; or multiple agencies joining together to fund an agreement encompassing multiple providers. Other transaction agreements are legally binding contracts; they are referred to as agreements to distinguish them from the traditional procurement contracts governed by the FAR and procurements laws. Other transaction authorities are set forth in two sections of law: 10 U.S.C. 2371—granting authority to use OTs for basic, applied, and advanced research projects. 10 U.S.C. 2371b—granting authority to use OTs for prototype projects and follow-on production. Under this authority, a prototype project can only be conducted if at least one nontraditional defense contractor significantly participates in the project; all significant participants are small businesses or nontraditional defense contractors; at least one-third of the total cost of the prototype project is provided by nongovernment participants; or the senior procurement acquisition official provides a written justification for using an OT. Follow-on production can only be conducted when the underlying prototype OT was competitively awarded, and the prototype project was successfully completed.

It notes that while the federal government has enacted several sector-specific data protection statutes, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), these laws are limited in scope and do not provide a unified framework for protecting personal data. The report also discusses the role of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in enforcing unfair and deceptive data practices, but emphasizes that no single federal law comprehensively regulates the collection and use of personal data. In contrast, some state and foreign governments, such as California and the European Union, have enacted more comprehensive data protection legislation, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The report highlights the increasing concerns over data privacy and security, particularly as the internet of things (IoT) and other technologies expand the ways in which personal data is collected and used. It also discusses the constitutional and common law protections for privacy, noting that while the Fourth Amendment provides some protections against government intrusion, it does not fully address the challenges posed by private sector data practices. The report further explores the potential legal considerations for the 116th Congress in crafting federal data protection legislation, including the need to balance privacy rights with free speech concerns, the role of federal agencies in enforcement, and the potential for preemption of state laws. The report concludes that while there is no consensus on the role of the federal government in data protection, the growing complexity of data privacy issues and the increasing reliance on digital technologies suggest that a more comprehensive federal approach may be necessary.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report.

The", "answers": ["Recent high-profile data breaches and other concerns about how third parties protect the privacy of individuals in the digital age have raised national concerns over legal protections of Americans' electronic data. Intentional intrusions into government and private computer networks and inadequate corporate privacy and cybersecurity practices have exposed the personal information of millions of Americans to unwanted recipients. At the same time, internet connectivity has increased and varied in form in recent years. Americans now transmit their personal data on the internet at an exponentially higher rate than in the past, and their data are collected, cultivated, and maintained by a growing number of both \"consumer facing\" and \"behind the scenes\" actors such as data brokers. As a consequence, the privacy, cybersecurity and protection of personal data have emerged as a major issue for congressional consideration. Despite the rise in interest in data protection, the legislative paradigms governing cybersecurity and data privacy are complex and technical, and lack uniformity at the federal level. The constitutional \"right to privacy\" developed over the course of the 20th century, but this right generally guards only against government intrusions and does little to shield the average internet user from private actors. At the federal statutory level, there are a number of statutes that protect individuals' personal data or concern cybersecurity, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, and others. And a number of different agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), enforce these laws. But these statutes primarily regulate certain industries and subcategories of data. The FTC fills in some of the statutory gaps by enforcing a broad prohibition against unfair and deceptive data protection practices. But no single federal law comprehensively regulates the collection and use of consumers' personal data. Seeking a more fulsome data protection system, some governments—such as California and the European Union (EU)—have recently enacted privacy laws regulating nearly all forms of personal data within their jurisdictional reach. Some argue that Congress should consider creating similar protections in federal law, but others have criticized the EU and California approaches as being overly prescriptive and burdensome. Should the 116th Congress consider a comprehensive federal data protection law, its legislative proposals may involve numerous decision points and legal considerations. Points of consideration may include the conceptual framework of the law (i.e., whether it is prescriptive or outcome-based), the scope of the law and its definition of protected information, and the role of the FTC or other federal enforcement agency. Further, if Congress wants to allow individuals to enforce data protection laws and seek remedies for the violations of such laws in court, it must account for standing requirements in Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution. Federal preemption also raises complex legal questions—not only of whether to preempt state law, but what form of preemption Congress should employ. Finally, from a First Amendment perspective, Supreme Court jurisprudence suggests that while some privacy, cybersecurity, or data security regulations are permissible, any federal law that restricts protected speech, particularly if it targets specific speakers or content, may be subject to more stringent review by a reviewing court."], "all_classes": null, "length": 18048}
{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report about the 2020 Census cost estimate. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report is from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and discusses the reliability of the Census Bureau's life-cycle cost estimate for the 2020 Census. The main issue is that the estimate isn't reliable because it doesn't fully meet the four characteristics outlined in the Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide: comprehensive, well-documented, accurate, and credible. \n\nFirst, the report mentions that reliable cost estimates are crucial for budgeting and managing programs. The Bureau has had issues with their cost estimates in the past, like the 2010 and 2020 Censuses. In 2015, they estimated the cost at $12.3 billion, but by 2017, that increased to $15.6 billion. The reasons for the increase include changes in assumptions, like lower self-response rates, which led to more field work, and higher IT costs. \n\nThe GAO found that while the Bureau made improvements, they still partially met the well-documented characteristic. The documentation was missing or inconsistent, making it hard to trace data sources and replicate calculations. The Bureau did better in accuracy and credibility, using sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulations for risk assessment. However, the independent cost estimates didn't fully cross-check the methods, and there were issues with linking contingency funds to specific risks.\n\nThe report also talks about the Bureau's efforts to improve their processes, like creating a standardized work breakdown structure (WBS) and updating their guidance. But the GAO still recommends that the Bureau needs to fully meet the well-documented criteria to make the estimate reliable. The final cost estimate is used for budgeting and decision-making, but without reliable estimates, the Bureau can't effectively manage the program.\n\nI need to condense all this into a one-page summary. Let me structure it with an introduction, key findings, the four characteristics, the cost changes, and the recommendations. I should mention the GAO's conclusion that the 2017 estimate isn't reliable yet and the need for better documentation. Also, highlight the increase in costs and the reasons behind it. Make sure to keep it concise, double-spaced, and within the margin requirements.

A high-quality, reliable cost estimate is a key tool for budgeting, planning, and managing the 2020 Census. Without this capability, the Bureau is at risk of experiencing program cost overruns, missed deadlines, and performance shortfalls. GAO was asked to evaluate the reliability of the Bureau's life-cycle cost estimate. This report evaluates the reliability of the Bureau's revised life-cycle cost estimate for the 2020 Census and the extent to which the Bureau is using it as a management tool, and compares the 2015 and 2017 cost estimates to describe key drivers of cost growth. GAO reviewed documentary and testimonial evidence from Bureau officials responsible for developing the 2020 Census cost estimate and used its cost assessment guide ( GAO-09-3SP ) as criteria. Since 2015, the Census Bureau (Bureau) has made significant progress in improving its ability to develop a reliable cost estimate. While improvements have been made, the Bureau's October 2017 cost estimate for the 2020 Census does not fully reflect all the characteristics of a reliable estimate. (See figure.) Specifically, for the characteristic of being well-documented, GAO found that some of the source data either did not support the information described in the cost estimate or was not in the files provided for two of its largest field operations. In GAO's assessment of the 2015 version of the 2020 Census cost estimate, GAO recommended that the Bureau take steps to ensure that each of the characteristics of a reliable cost estimate is met. The Bureau agreed and has taken steps, but has not fully implemented this recommendation. A reliable cost estimate serves as a tool for program development and oversight, helping management make informed decisions. During this review, GAO found the Bureau used the cost estimate to inform decision making. Factors that contributed to cost fluctuations between the 2015 and 2017 cost estimates include: Changes in assumptions. Among other changes, a decrease in the assumed rate for self-response from 63.5 percent in 2015 to 60.5 percent in 2017 increased the cost of collecting responses from nonresponding housing units. Improved ability to anticipate and quantify risk. In general, contingency allocations designed to address the effects of potential risks increased overall from $1.3 billion in 2015 to $2.6 billion in 2017. An overall increase in information technology (IT) costs. IT cost increases, totaling $1.59 billion, represented almost 50 percent of the total cost increase from 2015 to 2017. GAO is not making any new recommendations but maintains its earlier recommendation—that the Secretary of Commerce direct the Bureau to take specific steps to ensure its cost estimate meets the characteristics of a high-quality estimate. In its response to this report, Commerce generally agreed with the findings related to cost estimation improvements, but disagreed that the cost estimate was not reliable.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this detailed report about congressional pay. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report starts by mentioning the Constitution's Article I, Section 6, which says Congress's pay is determined by law and paid from the Treasury. Then there's the Twenty-Seventh Amendment, which requires a congressional election before any pay change takes effect. It was ratified in 1992. Since FY1983, pay has been in a permanent account. The last pay adjustment was in 2009, with most members earning $174k, except for the Speaker and leaders. \n\nThe report explains three methods for adjusting pay: specific legislation, presidential recommendations via a salary commission (which stopped in 1989), and annual adjustments based on the Employment Cost Index (ECI). The Ethics Reform Act of 1989 changed the annual adjustment method to use ECI. However, Congress can block these adjustments through appropriations bills or other legislation. \n\nThere's a lot about how the pay adjustments are calculated, the role of the ECI, and how sometimes Congress freezes pay. For example, in 2013, pay was frozen due to a law. The report also mentions that even though the ECI might suggest a raise, Congress can prevent it. \n\nThe report includes historical data on pay since 1789, tables showing adjustments, and mentions various bills that have tried to change pay. It also notes that pay has decreased in real terms since 2009 when adjusted for inflation. \n\nI need to condense all this into a one-page summary.

Make sure to mention the three adjustment methods and how they work. Also, the part", "answers": ["Congress is required by Article I, Section 6, of the Constitution to determine its own pay. In the past, Congress periodically enacted specific legislation to alter its pay; the last time this occurred affected pay in 1991. More recently, pay has been determined pursuant to laws establishing formulas for automatic adjustments. The Ethics Reform Act of 1989 established the current automatic annual adjustment formula, which is based on changes in private sector wages as measured by the Employment Cost Index (ECI). The adjustment is automatic unless denied statutorily, although the percentage may not exceed the percentage base pay increase for General Schedule (GS) employees. Member pay has since been frozen in two ways: (1) directly, through legislation that freezes salaries for Members but not for other federal employees, and (2) indirectly, through broader pay freeze legislation that covers Members and other specified categories of federal employees. Members of Congress last received a pay adjustment in January 2009. At that time, their salary was increased 2.8%, to $174,000. A provision in P.L. 111-8 prohibited any pay adjustment for 2010. Under the pay adjustment formula, Members were originally scheduled to receive an adjustment in January 2010 of 2.1%, although this would have been revised downward automatically to 1.5% to match the GS base pay adjustment. Members next were scheduled to receive a 0.9% pay adjustment in 2011. The pay adjustment was prohibited by P.L. 111-165. Additionally, P.L. 111-322 prevented any adjustment in GS base pay before December 31, 2012. Since the percentage adjustment in Member pay may not exceed the percentage adjustment in the base pay of GS employees, Member pay was also frozen during this period. If not limited by GS pay, Member pay could have been adjusted by 1.3% in 2012. The ECI formula established a maximum potential pay adjustment in January 2013 of 1.1%. P.L. 112-175 extended the freeze on GS pay rates for the duration of this continuing resolution, which also extended the Member freeze since the percentage adjustment in Member pay may not exceed the percentage adjustment in GS base pay. Subsequently, Member pay for 2013 was further frozen in P.L. 112-240. The maximum potential 2014 pay adjustment of 1.2%, or $2,100, was denied by P.L. 113-46. The maximum potential January 2015 Member pay adjustment was 1.6%, or $2,800. President Obama proposed a 1.0% increase in the base pay of GS employees, which would automatically have limited any Member pay adjustment to 1.0%. P.L. 113-235 contained a provision prohibiting any Member pay adjustment. The maximum potential January 2016 pay adjustment of 1.7%, or $3,000, would have been limited to 1.0%, or $1,700, due to the GS base pay increase. Member pay for 2016 was frozen by P.L. 114-113. The maximum potential January 2017 pay adjustment of 1.6%, or $2,800, would have been limited to 1.0%, or $1,700, due to the GS base pay increase. Member pay for 2017 was frozen by P.L. 114-254. The maximum potential January 2018 pay adjustment of 1.8%, or $3,100, was automatically limited to 1.4%, or $2,400, before being frozen by P.L. 115-141. The maximum potential January 2019 pay adjustment of 2.3%, or $4,000, was automatically limited to 1.4%, or $2,400, before being frozen at the 2009 level by P.L. 115-244. The maximum potential January 2020 pay adjustment is 2.6%, or $4,500. If Members of Congress had received every adjustment prescribed by the ECI formula since 1992, and the 2 U.S.C. §4501 limitation regarding the percentage base pay increase for GS employees remained unchanged, the 2019 salary would be $210,900. When adjusted for inflation, Member salaries have decreased 15% since the last pay adjustment in 2009. Both the automatic annual adjustments and funding for Members' salaries are provided pursuant to other laws (2 U.S.C. §4501)—not the annual appropriations bills—and a provision prohibiting a scheduled adjustment could be included in any bill, or introduced as a separate bill."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5069}

The report outlines DOD's definitions of these behaviors, the roles of various offices in prevention and response, and the challenges in implementing these policies effectively. Sexual assault is defined as intentional sexual contact involving force, threats, or lack of consent, while sexual harassment is recognized as an adverse behavior that can contribute to increased sexual assault incidents. The report highlights that DOD's policies, while comprehensive, lack some key elements from the CDC's framework for sexual violence prevention, such as risk and protective factors, and risk domains. Additionally, the report notes inconsistencies in data collection and reporting across military services, particularly for sexual harassment incidents, which hinder the ability to develop consistent department-wide reports. The DOD is in the process of updating its policies to include anonymous reporting mechanisms and align with the CDC's principles, but these updates are not yet fully implemented. The report also emphasizes the need for a long-term, results-oriented strategy to address the continuum of harm, including sexual harassment, sexual assault, and domestic violence.

Recent studies suggest that these behaviors are part of a “continuum of harm,” which DOD defines as a range of interconnected, inappropriate behaviors that are connected to the occurrence of sexual assault and that support an environment that tolerates these behaviors. Senate Report 114-255 included a provision for GAO to review efforts by DOD to prevent unwanted sexual behaviors in the military. GAO assessed the extent to which DOD has (1) policies on sexual harassment that include CDC principles and relevant legislative elements; (2) processes for maintaining and reporting consistent data on incidents of unwanted sexual behaviors; and (3) overarching efforts, including a prevention strategy, to address unwanted sexual behaviors across the continuum of harm. GAO reviewed DOD policies and pertinent databases, and interviewed agency officials. The Department of Defense's (DOD) policies on sexual harassment include some but not all of the Centers for Disease Control's (CDC) principles for preventing sexual violence and include most relevant legislative elements. GAO identified six principles from CDC's framework for preventing sexual violence, which CDC defines as including sexual harassment. GAO found that Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and military service policies generally include CDC's principles regarding prevention strategies, but none address risk and protective factors, which identify conditions or behaviors that might heighten or lower the risk of sexual harassment victimization or perpetration, respectively. Additionally, a statutory provision in fiscal year 2013 mandated that DOD, among other things, develop a comprehensive sexual harassment policy that includes prevention training, mechanisms for anonymous reporting, and mechanisms for resolving incidents of sexual harassment. OSD and service policies are generally consistent with those required elements except for the inclusion of anonymous reporting. DOD is developing a new department-wide policy that will address sexual harassment, but it is too early to determine how the policy will address these issues. Without policies that include CDC's principles and mechanisms for anonymous reporting, DOD may miss opportunities to address and potentially reduce incidents of unwanted sexual behaviors. Finally, a statutory change in fiscal year 2017 redefined sexual harassment for certain purposes so it is no longer defined solely as a form of sex discrimination but is recognized also as an adverse behavior on the spectrum of behavior that can contribute to an increase in the incidence of sexual assault. While officials indicated a need to update policies, they were unclear on the full implications, if any, of this change. DOD has processes for maintaining and reporting consistent data on incidents of unwanted sexual behaviors including sexual assault and incidents of domestic violence that involve sexual assault, but does not have similar processes for maintaining and reporting data on incidents of sexual harassment. Specifically, DOD uses centralized databases to maintain and report data on incidents of sexual assault and domestic violence that involve sexual assault, but relies on military service-specific databases for information on incidents of sexual harassment. DOD has not established standard data elements and definitions to guide the services in maintaining and reporting data on sexual harassment. Inconsistencies in data elements and definitions generally mean that one service may be maintaining data that is more or less detailed than, or that differs from, the data maintained by other services. Such inconsistencies may create difficulties in reporting department-wide sexual harassment data, since the individual service data must be adapted to fit reporting requirements. DOD has several overarching efforts to address unwanted sexual behaviors across the continuum of harm, including developing an overarching prevention strategy. However, it is unclear whether the strategy under development will contain key elements for long-term and results-oriented strategic planning such as long-term goals, strategies to achieve goals, and metrics to gauge progress. Without incorporating these elements into its overarching prevention strategy, DOD may not be in a position to effectively coordinate and integrate prevention activities and reduce instances of unwanted sexual behaviors. GAO recommends that DOD fully include in its new policy on sexual harassment CDC's principles for sexual violence prevention and mechanisms for anonymous reporting, develop standard data elements and definitions for reporting sexual harassment incidents, and incorporate in its overarching prevention strategy elements key for a long-term, results-oriented strategy.

As of June 2018, the Secret Service had approximately 7,100 employees, with 190 dedicated to IT, operating under a centralized CIO structure since 2017. The agency plans to spend $104.8 million on IT in fiscal year 2018, with a major focus on modernizing its infrastructure through the Information Integration and Technology Transformation (IITT) program, which has a projected life cycle cost of $811 million. Despite these efforts, the Secret Service has struggled with outdated systems, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and a lack of skilled IT personnel. The agency has initiated the IITT program to modernize its IT infrastructure, communications systems, and applications, but has faced challenges in workforce planning, training, and ensuring that IT contracts are properly reviewed. The Secret Service’s CIO has partially implemented key IT oversight responsibilities, including managing the IT investment portfolio and ensuring compliance with DHS policies. However, the agency has not fully established an IT acquisition review process, leading to potential gaps in oversight. Additionally, the Secret Service has not fully implemented leading workforce planning and management practices, such as strategic planning, recruitment, training, and performance management. The agency has made progress in improving employee morale through initiatives like student loan repayment programs, but has not yet demonstrated sustained improvement.

To accomplish its mission, the Secret Service relies heavily on the use of IT infrastructure and systems. In 2009, the component initiated the IITT investment—a portfolio of programs and projects that are intended to, among other things, improve systems availability and security in support of the component's business operations. GAO was asked to review the Secret Service's oversight of its IT portfolio and workforce. This report discusses the extent to which the (1) CIO implemented selected IT oversight responsibilities, (2) Secret Service implemented leading IT workforce planning and management practices, and (3) Secret Service and DHS implemented selected performance monitoring practices for IITT. GAO assessed agency documentation against 14 selected component CIO responsibilities established in DHS policy; 15 selected leading workforce planning and management practices within 5 topic areas; and two selected leading industry project monitoring practices that, among other things, were, in GAO's professional judgment, of most significance to managing IITT. The U.S. Secret Service (Secret Service) Chief Information Officer (CIO) fully implemented 11 of 14 selected information technology (IT) oversight responsibilities, and partially implemented the remaining 3. The CIO partially implemented the responsibilities to establish a process that ensures the Secret Service reviews IT contracts; ensure that the component's IT policies align with the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) policies; and set incremental targets to monitor program progress. Additional efforts to fully implement these 3 responsibilities will further position the CIO to effectively manage the IT portfolio. Of the 15 selected practices within the 5 workforce planning and management areas, the Secret Service fully implemented 3 practices, partly implemented 8, and did not implement 4 (see table). Within the strategic planning area, the component partly implemented the practice to, among other things, develop IT competency needs. While the Secret Service had defined general core competencies for its workforce, the Office of the CIO (OCIO) did not identify all of the technical competencies needed to support its functions. As a result, the office was limited in its ability to address any IT competency gaps that may exist. Also, while work remains to improve morale across the component, the Secret Service substantially implemented the employee morale practices for its IT staff. Secret Service officials said the gaps in implementing the workforce practices were due to, among other things, their focus on reorganizing the IT workforce within OCIO. Until the Secret Service fully implements these practices for its IT workforce, it may be limited in its ability to ensure the timely and effective acquisition and maintenance of the component's IT infrastructure and services. Of the two selected IT project monitoring practices, DHS and the Secret Service fully implemented the first practice to monitor the performance of the Information Integration and Technology Transformation (IITT) investment. In addition, for the second practice—to monitor projects on incremental development metrics—the Secret Service fully implemented the practice on one of IITT's projects and partially implemented it on another. In particular, OCIO did not fully measure post-deployment user satisfaction with the system on one project. OCIO plans to conduct a user satisfaction survey of the system by September 2018, which should inform the office on whether the system is meeting users' needs.

To provide insight into these issues, this report examines (1) patterns in disciplinary actions among public schools, (2) challenges selected school districts reported with student behavior and how they are approaching school discipline, and (3) actions Education and Justice have taken to identify and address disparities or discrimination in school discipline. GAO analyzed discipline data from nearly all public schools for school year 2013-14 from Education's Civil Rights Data Collection; interviewed federal and state officials, as well as officials from a total of 5 districts and 19 schools in California, Georgia, Massachusetts, North Dakota, and Texas. We selected these districts based on disparities in suspensions for Black students, boys, or students with disabilities, and diversity in size and location. We also reviewed federal laws and a non-generalizable sample of seven recently resolved federal school discipline investigations (selected in part based on the type of alleged discrimination). We incorporated technical comments from the agencies as appropriate.

For example, Black students accounted for 15.5 percent of all public school students, but represented about 39 percent of students suspended from school—an overrepresentation of about 23 percentage points (see figure). Officials GAO interviewed in all five school districts in the five states GAO visited reported various challenges with addressing student behavior, and said they were considering new approaches to school discipline. They described a range of issues, some complex—such as the effects of poverty and mental health issues. For example, officials in four school districts described a growing trend of behavioral challenges related to mental health and trauma. While there is no one-size-fits-all solution for the issues that influence student behavior, officials from all five school districts GAO visited were implementing alternatives to disciplinary actions that remove children from the classroom, such as initiatives that promote positive behavioral expectations for students. Education and the Department of Justice (Justice) documented several actions taken to identify and address school discipline issues. For example, both agencies investigated cases alleging discrimination. Further, to help identify persistent disparities among the nation's schools, Education collects comprehensive data on school discipline every other year through its Civil Rights Data Collection effort."], "all_classes": null, "length": 11834}

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points. \n\nThe report talks about federal land ownership in the U.S., which is about 640 million acres, mostly in the western states. The main agencies involved are NPS, FWS, BLM, and FS. They each have different authorities for acquiring and disposing of land. The BLM has the broadest authority, while the NPS has the most restrictions. The report explains the various laws and acts that give these agencies their powers, like the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) for the BLM and FS. \n\nThere's a lot about how each agency can acquire land—like the NPS needing congressional action for new parks, the FS using the Weeks Act, and the FWS using the Migratory Bird Conservation Act. Disposal authorities are also covered, with the BLM having more flexibility, while the NPS and FWS have stricter rules. The report mentions specific laws like the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) for funding acquisitions, and the challenges with funding levels. \n\nCongress is often involved in debating these authorities, with proposals to modify or eliminate certain laws. There are also discussions about the extent of federal land ownership and its impact on states and local communities. The summary needs to capture all these elements concisely. \n\nI should start by stating the main fact about federal land ownership. Then mention the agencies and their varying authorities.

Four agencies—the National Park Service (NPS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the Department of the Interior, and the U.S. Forest Service (FS) in the Department of Agriculture—administer about 95% of those lands. The extent to which each of these four federal agencies have authority to acquire and dispose of land varies considerably. The BLM has relatively broad authority for both acquisitions and disposals under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA). The agency also has other authorities for disposing of land, including two laws that allow the agency to retain the proceeds for subsequent land acquisition, among other purposes, and a law that allows transfers to governmental units and other entities for public purposes. By contrast, the NPS has no general authority to acquire land to create new park units or to dispose of park lands. The FS authority to acquire lands is mostly limited to lands within or contiguous to the boundaries of a national forest. The agency has various authorities to dispose of land, but they are relatively constrained and infrequently used. The FWS has various authorities to acquire lands but no general authority to dispose of its lands. The agency frequently uses acquisition authority under the Migratory Bird Conservation Act of 1929 because of the availability of funding through the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund. The nature of the acquisition and disposal authorities of the four federal agencies also varies. In general, the acquisition authorities are designed to allow the four agencies to bring into federal ownership lands that many contend could benefit from federal management. Disposal authorities generally are designed to allow agencies to convey land that is no longer needed for a federal purpose or that might be chiefly valuable for another purpose. Some of the authorities specify particular circumstances where they can be used, such as the conveyance of FS land for educational purposes and the disposal of BLM land for recreation and public purposes. Congress often faces questions on the adequacy of existing acquisition and disposal authorities; the nature, extent, and location of their use; and the extent of federal land ownership overall. The current acquisition and disposal authorities form the backdrop for consideration of measures to establish, modify, or eliminate authorities, or to provide for the acquisition or disposal of particular lands. In some cases, Congress enacts bills to provide authority to acquire or dispose of particular parcels where no standing authority exists and, in other cases, to direct or facilitate land transactions. Congress also addresses acquisition and disposal policy in the context of debates on the role and goals of the federal government in owning and managing land generally, and it has considered broader measures to dispose of lands or to promote acquisition. Other issues for Congress pertain to the sources and levels of funds for land acquisition. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is the primary source of funding for land acquisition. Congress has considered diverse measures related to the LWCF, such as legislation to make LWCF funding permanent and bills to direct LWCF monies to additional, nonacquisition purposes. Additionally, the FWS has the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund, an account with mandatory spending authority supported by revenue from three sources.

Let me start by reading through the report again to get the main points.\n\nThe report starts by explaining that the House has a complex set of rules, precedents, and practices, but understanding them isn't too hard because the procedures are generally predictable. The key principle is that the majority can prevail without undue delay, so there's no filibuster. The Constitution allows the House to set its own rules, which can be amended unilaterally. The Speaker doesn't enforce rules on their own; Members have to make points of order. There are time limits on debate, like one hour per Member, and some measures have stricter limits. The House uses different modes of consideration, like suspension of the rules, which allows quick passage with a two-thirds vote. \n\nThen there's the Committee of the Whole, where most major bills are debated and amended. The rules here are more flexible, allowing more amendments. The process involves general debate, then amending section by section. Special rules from the Rules Committee set the terms for considering bills, like open or closed rules. Conference committees resolve differences between the House and Senate versions of a bill. The House also has procedures for votes, including voice votes, division votes, and electronic votes. There are precedents and manuals that outline these procedures, and various CRS reports provide more detailed information.\n\nNow, I need to condense all this into a one-page summary. I should start with an introduction about the complexity of House procedures but their predictability. Mention the majority rule principle, the Constitution's role, and the flexibility in rules. Then outline the key elements: debate limits, suspension of rules, Committee of the Whole, special rules, conference committees, voting procedures, and the resources available. I need to make sure each section is concise, avoid jargon, and keep it to one page. Let me check the structure again to ensure I cover all main points without getting too detailed. Also, make sure to mention the importance of the majority's ability to act and the role of the Rules Committee. Alright, time to put it all together in a coherent summary.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of the report on House of Representatives legislative procedures. Let me start by outlining the key points from the report to ensure I cover everything without getting too detailed.\n\nFirst, the report explains that", "answers": ["The daily order of business on the floor of the House of Representatives is governed by standing rules that make certain matters and actions privileged for consideration. On a day-to-day basis, however, the House can also decide to grant individual bills privileged access to the floor, using one of several parliamentary mechanisms. The standing rules of the House include several different parliamentary mechanisms that the body may use to act on bills and resolutions. Which of these will be employed in a given instance usually depends on the extent to which Members want to debate and amend the legislation. In general, all of the procedures of the House permit a majority of Members to work their will without excessive delay. The House considers most legislation by motions to suspend the rules, with limited debate and no floor amendments, with the support of at least two-thirds of the Members voting. Occasionally, the House will choose to consider a measure on the floor by the unanimous consent of Members. The Rules Committee is instrumental in recommending procedures for considering major bills and may propose restrictions on the floor amendments that Members can offer or bar them altogether. Many major bills are first considered in Committee of the Whole before being passed by a simple majority vote of the House. The Committee of the Whole is governed by more flexible procedures than the basic rules of the House, under which a majority can vote to pass a bill after only one hour of debate and with no floor amendments. Although a quorum is supposed to be present on the floor when the House is conducting business, the House assumes a quorum is present unless a quorum call or electronically recorded vote demonstrates that it is not. However, the standing rules preclude quorum calls at most times other than when the House is voting. Questions are first decided by voice vote, although any Member may then demand a division vote. Before the final result of a voice or division vote is announced, Members can secure an electronically recorded vote instead if enough Members desire it or if a quorum is not present in the House. The constitutional requirements for making law mean that each chamber must pass the same measure with the identical text before transmitting it to the President for his consideration. When the second chamber of Congress amends a measure sent to it by the first chamber, the two chambers must resolve legislative differences to meet this requirement. This can be accomplished by shuttling the bill back and forth between the House and Senate, with each chamber proposing amendments to the position of the other, or by establishing a conference committee to try to negotiate a compromise version of the legislation."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6694}

It covers the history, the criteria for exemption, the 2016 and 2019 rules, and the impact of these changes.\n\nFirst, the FLSA was enacted in 1938 and requires overtime pay for non-exempt employees. The EAP exemptions allow certain white-collar workers to be exempt. The main criteria are salary basis, duties, and salary level. The report mentions that the Secretary of Labor defines these exemptions through regulations. There have been nine rules since 1938, with salary thresholds increasing over time.\n\nThe 2016 final rule tried to raise the salary threshold but was invalidated by a court. The 2019 proposed rule aims to update the thresholds again, increasing the standard salary level to $679 per week and the HCE threshold to $147,414 annually. The report also discusses the impact of these changes, estimating that around 4.9 million workers would be affected, with some gaining overtime pay and others having stronger protections.\n\nI need to structure the summary into sections: overview of FLSA and EAP exemptions, criteria for exemption, historical context of rules, the 2016 and 2019 rules, and the implications.

Make sure to mention that", "answers": ["The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), enacted in 1938, is the main federal law that establishes general wage and hour standards for most, but not all, private and public sector employees. Among other protections, the FLSA establishes that covered nonexempt employees must be compensated at one-and-a-half times their regular rate of pay for each hour worked over 40 hours in a workweek. The FLSA also establishes certain exemptions from its general labor market standards. One of the major exemptions to the overtime provisions in the FLSA is for bona fide \"executive, administrative, and professional\" employees (the \"EAP\" or \"white collar\" exemptions). The FLSA grants authority to the Secretary of Labor to define and delimit the EAP exemption \"from time to time.\" To qualify for this exemption from the FLSA's overtime pay requirement, an employee must be salaried (the \"salary basis\" test); perform specified executive, administrative, or professional duties (the \"duties\" test); and earn above an established salary level threshold (the \"salary level\" test). In March 2019, the Secretary of Labor published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to make changes to the EAP exemptions. The 2019 proposed rule would become effective around January 2020. The major changes in the 2019 proposed rule include increasing the standard salary level threshold from the previous level of $455 per week to $679 per week and committing the Department of Labor (DOL) to updating the EAP exemptions every four years through the rulemaking process. The 2019 proposed rule does not change the duties and responsibilities that employees must perform to be exempt. Thus, the 2019 proposed rule would affect EAP employees at salary levels between $455 and $679 per week in 2020. DOL estimates that about 4.9 million workers would be affected in the first year, including about 1.3 million EAP employees who would become newly entitled to overtime pay and an additional 3.6 million workers who would have overtime protection clarified and thereby strengthened.

However, the final enacted legislation, P.L. 116-6, provided $54.38 billion, a 0.3% decrease from FY2018 and 30% more than the requested amount. The bill included $8.0 billion designated as Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), or about 15% of total SFOPS funding. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 raised discretionary spending limits, allowing the Administration to fund the entire SFOPS budget through base funds rather than OCO. The House and Senate bills proposed slightly higher funding than the request, with the House at $54.18 billion and the Senate at $54.602 billion. The final legislation maintained funding for the State Department and Related Agencies at $16.46 billion, a 0.9% increase from FY2018. The State Department's requested cuts focused on diplomatic security, international organizations, and peacekeeping activities, but the enacted bill largely maintained these levels. The bill also included provisions for the Leadership and Modernization Impact Initiative, which aimed to modernize the department's operations. The foreign operations accounts received $37.92 billion, with $3.63 billion designated as OCO, totaling $39.85 billion in foreign aid, slightly below FY2018 levels. The bill preserved the existing bilateral account structure and funded the Inter-American Foundation and U.S.-Africa Development Foundation at FY2018 levels. Key recipients of foreign aid included Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and others, with significant cuts in aid to Europe and Eurasia and Sub-Saharan Africa. The bill also addressed humanitarian assistance, maintaining funding levels close to FY2018, and included provisions for global health, security assistance, and economic development programs. Overall, the final legislation provided more funding than the Administration's request, reflecting a compromise between the requested cuts and the legislative process.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this detailed report about the FY2019 budget for the Department of State and related programs.

With the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA; P.L. 115-123, February 9, 2018), which raised discretionary spending limits set by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25), the Administration's FY2019 foreign affairs funding request was entirely within enduring (base) funds; no Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding was included the SFOPS request for the first time since FY2012. The FY2019 request would have represented a 23.3% decrease in SFOPS funding compared with FY2018 actual funding levels. The proposed State and related agency funding would have been 18.7% below FY2018 funding and the foreign operations funding would have been reduced by 25.2%. In the State and related programs budget, cuts were proposed for several accounts, including the diplomatic security accounts, contributions to international organizations, and contributions for international peacekeeping activities. In the foreign operations budget, cuts would have been applied across all accounts, with disproportionately large cuts proposed for humanitarian assistance, multilateral assistance, and funding for bilateral development programs focused on agriculture, education, and democracy promotion. Both the House and Senate appropriations committees approved FY2019 SFOPS bills that included funding at higher levels than the Administration requested and closer to FY2018 funding.

S. 3108, approved by the Senate appropriations committee on June 21, 2018, would have provided $54.602 billion for SFOPS accounts. FY2019 began with seven appropriations bills, including SFOPS, unfinished. Congress and the President approved continuing resolutions to fund the affected federal agencies through December 21, 2018 at the FY2018 level (P.L. 115-245, Division C and P.L. 115-298).

Vacancies are particularly concentrated in high-priority regions such as South and Central Asia and the Near East, which face heightened security risks. The report highlights that vacancies in critical roles, such as security officers, information management specialists, and office management specialists, have increased security vulnerabilities and operational challenges. These vacancies have led to increased workloads for existing staff, reduced morale, and hindered the ability to conduct essential diplomatic and economic functions.

In 2009 and 2012, GAO identified ongoing Foreign Service staffing gaps. GAO was asked to review State's Foreign Service staffing. This report examines (1) vacancies in State's Foreign Service staffing at overseas posts, (2) reported effects of Foreign Service vacancies on diplomatic readiness, and (3) State's efforts to address Foreign Service vacancies. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed State's Global Employment Management System data as of March 2018. The system includes information on Foreign Service and Civil Service positions, including the total number of authorized Foreign Service positions and whether each position is filled or vacant. GAO also reviewed its relevant prior reports and State workforce planning documents. In addition, GAO interviewed State staff at 10 overseas posts, selected on the basis of large numbers of Foreign Service vacancies and diversity in the types of Foreign Service positions that were vacant at these posts, among other factors. The Department of State's (State) data show persistent Foreign Service vacancies at overseas posts since 2008. According to the data, 13 percent of overseas Foreign Service positions were vacant as of March 2018. This percentage is similar to the percentages GAO reported for 2008 and 2012, when 14 percent of these positions were vacant. In addition, State's data show persistent vacancies at overseas posts in generalist positions that help formulate and implement U.S. foreign policy and in specialist positions that support and maintain the functioning of overseas posts. State's data also show persistent Foreign Service vacancies at overseas posts with State's highest foreign policy priorities and in regions with security risks that could threaten U.S. foreign policy interests. According to staff at overseas posts, Foreign Service vacancies adversely affect State's ability to carry out U.S. foreign policy. Staff at overseas posts told us that vacancies increase workloads, contributing to low morale and higher stress for Foreign Service staff and that vacancies in Political and Economic positions—20 percent and 16 percent, respectively—limit the reporting on political and economic issues that posts are able to provide to State headquarters. Notably, officials also stated that vacancies in specialist positions may heighten security risks at overseas posts and disrupt post operations. For instance, some overseas post staff said that vacancies in Information Management positions had increased the vulnerability of posts' computer networks to potential cybersecurity attacks and other malicious threats. State described various efforts—implemented by multiple offices in the department —to help address overseas Foreign Service vacancies, but these efforts are not guided by an integrated action plan to reduce persistent vacancies. An example of State's efforts is the “Hard-to-Fill” program, which allows Civil Service staff an opportunity to fill a Foreign Service vacancy on a single overseas tour. According to GAO's 2017 High-Risk Series report, an agency should design and implement an action plan—integrated across its relevant offices—that defines the root causes of all skills gaps and suggests corrective measures. However, State has not developed such an action plan for reducing persistent overseas Foreign Service vacancies. Without developing an integrated action plan, overseas Foreign Service vacancies may persist. As a result, State's ability to achieve U.S. foreign policy goals and help ensure secure and efficient operations could be adversely impacted.

{"pred": " The report discusses the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) and its evolving role in the context of changing oil and petroleum product markets. It highlights that U.S. domestic crude oil production has increased significantly since 2008 due to technological advancements, leading to a decline in net imports and a projected shift to net exporter status by the late 2020s. This shift means the U.S. will no longer have a 90-day reserve obligation under the International Energy Agency (IEA), though it will still need to respond to supply disruptions. The SPR, managed by the Department of Energy (DOE), stores crude oil in underground salt caverns along the Gulf Coast and currently has a design capacity of 713.5 million barrels. However, the report notes that the SPR's infrastructure is aging, with significant maintenance needs and equipment failures, raising concerns about its operational readiness. The SPR is primarily composed of crude oil, which limits its effectiveness in responding to domestic supply disruptions that affect refined products. The report also discusses the SPR's role in meeting IEA obligations, including collective actions to address global supply disruptions, and notes that the U.S. relies on public reserves, unlike most other IEA members who use private reserves. The report highlights the need for a comprehensive reevaluation of the SPR's size, configuration, and modernization plans, as well as the potential benefits of regional petroleum product reserves in vulnerable areas. It recommends that the DOE conduct additional analyses, consider private-sector responses, and explore options for managing excess SPR assets. The report concludes that without such actions, the SPR may not be optimally sized or configured to meet future energy security needs and international obligations.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report about the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nFirst, the report talks about how U.S. oil production has increased, especially since 2008 due to shale technology. This has led to a decrease in net oil imports, which are projected to drop to zero by the late 2020s, making the U.S. a net exporter. That means the SPR's 90-day reserve obligation under the IEA might no longer apply, but the U.S. would still need to respond to supply disruptions. \n\nThe SPR is managed by the DOE and stores crude oil in salt caverns in Louisiana and Texas. It has four sites with", "answers": ["More than 4 decades ago, Congress authorized the creation of the SPR to reduce the impact of disruptions in supplies of petroleum products. DOE manages the SPR. As a member of the International Energy Agency, the United States is obligated to maintain reserves equivalent to at least 90 days of the previous year's net imports (imports minus exports). The SPR's storage and related infrastructure is aging, and DOE has plans to modernize these facilities. Since 2015, Congress has mandated crude oil sales. As of March 2018, the SPR held about 665 million barrels of crude oil. GAO was asked to examine the SPR's ability to meet U.S. energy security needs. This report examines, among other things, the extent to which (1) DOE has identified the optimal size of the SPR, and (2) DOE's plans for modernizing the SPR take into account the effects of congressionally mandated crude oil sales. GAO reviewed DOE's plans and studies, and interviewed agency officials and nine experts selected based on prior work, referrals, and a literature review. The Department of Energy (DOE) has not identified the optimal size of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). In 2016, DOE completed a long-term strategic review of the SPR after its last comprehensive examination conducted in 2005. The 2016 review examined the benefits of several SPR sizes, but it did not identify an optimal size and its review was limited in several ways. In particular, DOE did not fully consider recent and expected future changes in market conditions, such as the implications of falling net imports, or the role that increased levels of private reserves (reserves held by private companies for their own purposes) may play in responding to supply disruptions. These changes have contributed to SPR and private reserves reaching historically high levels on a net imports basis (see figure). These changes are expected to continue to evolve—according to government projections, the United States will become a net exporter in the late 2020s before again becoming a net importer between 2040 and 2050. GAO has found that agencies should reexamine their programs if conditions change. Without addressing the limitations of its 2016 review and periodically performing reexaminations in the future, DOE cannot be assured that the SPR will be sized appropriately into the future. DOE has taken steps to take into account congressionally mandated sales of SPR crude oil in its $1.4 billion modernization plans for SPR's infrastructure and facilities. The SPR is projected to hold 405 million barrels of oil by the end of fiscal year 2027. However, DOE's current plans are based on information analyzed prior to recently mandated sales. According to DOE officials, the agency began a study in March 2018 to assess the effects of these sales on the SPR's modernization. However, this study is not examining all options for handling any excess SPR assets that may be created by currently mandated sales or any additional sales that may be mandated in the future, inconsistent with an agency order on real property asset management that calls for identifying excess assets. For example, DOE does not plan to examine the potential to lease unused SPR storage capacity to the private sector because DOE is not currently authorized to enter into such leases, according to agency officials. If authorized, leasing capacity could generate revenues that could help offset the costs of modernization. By not examining a full range of options, DOE risks missing beneficial ways to modernize the SPR while saving taxpayer resources. GAO is making four recommendations, including that DOE (1) supplement the 2016 review by conducting an additional analysis, (2) ensure that the agency periodically reexamines the size of the SPR, and (3) consider a full range of options for handling potentially excess assets as it conducts its study, among other things. DOE agreed with two, partially agreed with one, and disagreed with another recommendation on refined product reserve studies.

To provide a more efficient, cost-effective way for its medical centers to order supplies, the VA established the MSPV-NG program. The program's goals include involving clinicians in requirements development, leveraging buying power when making competitive awards, and consolidating supplies used across medical centers. VA began developing requirements in early 2015 and launched the program in December 2016. This testimony summarizes key information contained in GAO's November 2017 report, GAO-18-34 . Specifically, it addresses the extent to which VA's implementation of MSPV-NG has been effective in meeting program goals. GAO analyzed VA's requirements development and contracting processes, and identified key supply chain practices cited by four leading hospital networks. GAO also met with contracting and clinical officials at six medical centers, selected based on high dollar contract obligations in fiscal years 2014-2016 and geographic representation. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) established the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor-Next Generation (MSPV-NG) program to provide an efficient, cost-effective way for its facilities to order supplies, but its initial implementation did not have an overarching strategy, stable leadership, and workforce capacity that could have facilitated medical center buy-in for the change. VA also developed requirements for a broad range of MSPV-NG items with limited clinical input. Further, starting in June 2015, VA planned to award competitive contracts, but instead, 79 percent of the items available for purchase under MSPV-NG were added through non-competitive agreements. (See figure). As a result, the program did not meet the needs of medical centers, and usage remained below VA's 40 percent target. (See figure.) VA has taken steps to address some deficiencies and is developing a new approach to the program. However, VA will likely continue to face challenges in meeting its goals until it fully addresses these existing shortcomings. GAO made 10 recommendations in its November 2017 report, including that VA develop an overarching strategy, expand clinician input in requirements development, and establish a plan for awarding future competitive contracts.

{"pred": " The report provides an in-depth overview of the U.S. Navy's ship-naming process, highlighting its historical evolution, current practices, and the role of various stakeholders. Traditionally, the Secretary of the Navy, under the President's direction and guided by Congress, has been responsible for naming new ships. While the U.S. Code no longer explicitly assigns this authority, the Secretary retains implicit power, particularly given the placement of relevant laws in Title 10, which governs the Navy and Marine Corps. The process involves a blend of tradition, legislation, and evolving practices, with the Naval History and Heritage Command playing a key role in compiling name recommendations based on historical research and public input. These recommendations are reviewed by the Chief of Naval Operations and the Secretary of the Navy, who ultimately selects the names, often considering factors like geographic locations, historical figures, and national heroes. The report notes that naming conventions have changed over time, with ship types like attack submarines and cruisers shifting from naming for cities to states and battles. Exceptions to these rules are common, especially for honoring Presidents or Congress members, and the Navy has occasionally named ships for living individuals, a practice that has seen a resurgence since the 1970s. The report also addresses controversies, such as naming ships after Confederate figures or controversial historical figures, and the impact of congressional influence on naming decisions. It emphasizes that while there is no fixed policy, the Navy continues to balance tradition with the need to adapt to modern circumstances, ensuring that ship names reflect the Navy's rich history and values. The report concludes that current practices are consistent with historical traditions and that establishing fixed policies is not advisable, as they would not improve the existing system.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report about the U.S. Navy's ship-naming process. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nFirst, the report explains that the Secretary of the Navy traditionally names ships, with the President's direction and Congress's laws. The law changed in 1925, but the Secretary still has implicit authority. The Naval History and Heritage Command helps by compiling name recommendations from various sources like history, public suggestions, and service members. The process involves the Chief of Naval Operations and the Secretary, who then selects the names. \n\nThe report mentions that naming conventions have evolved over time. For example, attack submarines were once named for fish, then cities, and now states. Cruisers have also changed their naming rules. There", "answers": ["Names for Navy ships traditionally have been chosen and announced by the Secretary of the Navy, under the direction of the President and in accordance with rules prescribed by Congress. Rules for giving certain types of names to certain types of Navy ships have evolved over time. There have been exceptions to the Navy's ship-naming rules, particularly for the purpose of naming a ship for a person when the rule for that type of ship would have called for it to be named for something else. Some observers have perceived a breakdown in, or corruption of, the rules for naming Navy ships. On July 13, 2012, the Navy submitted to Congress a 73-page report on the Navy's policies and practices for naming ships. For ship types now being procured for the Navy, or recently procured for the Navy, naming rules can be summarized as follows: The first Ohio replacement ballistic missile submarine (SSBN-826) has been named Columbia in honor of the District of Columbia, but the Navy has not stated what the naming rule for these ships will be. Virginia (SSN-774) class attack submarines are being named for states. Aircraft carriers are generally named for past U.S. Presidents. Of the past 14, 10 were named for past U.S. Presidents, and 2 for Members of Congress. Destroyers are being named for deceased members of the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, including Secretaries of the Navy. The Navy has not yet announced a naming rule for its planned new class of FFG(X) frigates, the first of which the Navy wants to procure in FY2021. Previous classes of U.S. Navy frigates, like Navy destroyers, were generally named for naval leaders and heroes. Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) are being named for regionally important U.S. cities and communities. Amphibious assault ships are being named for important battles in which U.S. Marines played a prominent part, and for famous earlier U.S. Navy ships that were not named for battles. San Antonio (LPD-17) class amphibious ships are being named for major U.S. cities and communities, and cities and communities attacked on September 11, 2001. John Lewis (TAO-205) class oilers are being named for people who fought for civil rights and human rights. Expeditionary Fast Transports (EPFs) are being named for small U.S. cities. Expeditionary Transport Docks (ESDs) and Expeditionary Sea Bases (ESBs) are being named for famous names or places of historical significance to U.S. Marines. Navajo (TATS-6) class towing, salvage, and rescue ships are being named for prominent Native Americans or Native American tribes. Since 1974, at least 21 U.S. military ships have been named for persons who were living at the time the name was announced. The most recent instance occurred on May 6, 2019, when the Navy announced that it was naming the destroyer DDG-51 for former Senator Sam Nunn. Members of the public are sometimes interested in having Navy ships named for their own states or cities, for older U.S. Navy ships (particularly those on which they or their relatives served), for battles in which they or their relatives participated, or for people they admire. Congress has long maintained an interest in how Navy ships are named, and has influenced the naming of certain Navy ships. The Navy suggests that congressional offices wishing to express support for proposals to name a Navy ship for a specific person, place, or thing contact the office of the Secretary of the Navy to make their support known. Congress may also pass legislation relating to ship names. Measures passed by Congress in recent years regarding Navy ship names have all been sense-of-the-Congress provisions."], "all_classes": null, "length": 9736}
{"pred": " The U.S. Fourth National Climate Assessment (2018) highlights that climate change is already affecting the U.S. and will worsen without significant action to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. While international and sub-national efforts are underway, federal policymakers have divergent views on how to address climate change. Some argue that climate change poses an existential threat, necessitating immediate emission reductions, while others question the risks and potential economic impacts of such measures. A carbon tax or GHG emissions fee is one proposed policy tool to reduce emissions by increasing the cost of carbon-intensive activities. This report focuses on the design, economic impacts, and distributional effects of a carbon tax.\n\nA carbon tax could be applied to emissions or their inputs, such as fossil fuels, thereby increasing the cost of carbon-intensive energy sources like coal. This could spur innovation in cleaner technologies and energy efficiency. However, it may also lead to higher energy prices, affecting industries and low-income households disproportionately. The report discusses various design considerations, including the point of taxation (upstream, midstream, or downstream), the tax rate, and potential border adjustments to address competitiveness concerns with international trade.\n\nThe economic impacts of a carbon tax depend on its design and revenue use. Revenue recycling options, such as reducing distortionary taxes or providing lump-sum rebates, can mitigate economy-wide costs. Studies suggest that using carbon tax revenues to offset labor or capital taxes could yield the greatest economic benefits. However, lower-income households may face regressive impacts unless revenues are distributed to them. The report also notes that a carbon tax could disproportionately affect \"emission-intensive, trade-exposed\" industries, such as steel and cement, and coal-dependent communities. Policymakers may need to consider transition assistance for these sectors.\n\nThe report highlights that while a carbon tax could help meet U.S. emission reduction targets under the Paris Agreement, the effectiveness and economic impacts depend on the tax rate, scope, and how revenues are used. The potential for emissions leakage and the need for international cooperation are also discussed. Overall, the report underscores the complexity of designing a carbon tax that balances climate goals with economic and social considerations.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report on the U.S. Fourth National Climate Assessment and carbon tax considerations. Let me start by understanding the key points from the report.\n\nFirst, the report mentions that climate change is already affecting the U.S. and will get worse unless emissions are reduced. There's a debate among policymakers about how to address this. Some see it", "answers": ["The U.S. Fourth National Climate Assessment, released in 2018, concluded that \"the impacts of global climate change are already being felt in the United States and are projected to intensify in the future—but the severity of future impacts will depend largely on actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas [GHG] emissions and to adapt to the changes that will occur.\" Members of Congress and stakeholders articulate a wide range of perspectives over what to do, if anything, about GHG emissions, future climate change, and related impacts. If Congress were to consider establishing a program to reduce GHG emissions, one option would be to attach a price to GHG emissions with a carbon tax or GHG emissions fee. In the 115th Congress, Members introduced nine bills to establish a carbon tax or emissions fee program. However, many Members have expressed their opposition to such an approach. In particular, in the 115th Congress, the House passed a resolution \"expressing the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the United States economy.\" Multiple economic studies have estimated the emission reductions that particular carbon tax would achieve. For example, a 2018 study analyzed various impacts of four carbon tax rate scenarios: a $25/metric ton of CO2 and $50/metric ton of CO2 carbon tax, increasing annually by 1% and 5%. The study concluded that each of the scenarios would likely achieve the U.S. GHG emission reduction target pledged under the international Paris Agreement (at least in terms of CO2 emissions). A carbon tax system would generate a new revenue stream, the magnitude of which would depend on the scope and rate of the tax, among other factors. In 2018, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that a $25/metric ton carbon tax would yield approximately $100 billion in its first year. CBO projected that federal revenue would total $3.5 trillion in FY2019. Policymakers would face challenging decisions regarding the distribution of the new carbon tax revenues. Congress could apply revenues to support a range of policy objectives but would encounter trade-offs among the objectives. The central trade-offs involve minimizing economy-wide costs, lessening the costs borne by specific groups—particularly low-income households and displaced workers in certain industries (e.g., coal mining)—and supporting other policy objectives. A primary argument against a carbon tax regards it potential economy-wide impacts, often measured as impacts to the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). Some may argue that projected impacts should be compared with the climate benefits achieved from the program as well as the estimated costs of taking no action. The potential impacts would depend on a number of factors, including the program's magnitude and design and, most importantly, the use of carbon tax revenues. In general, economic literature finds that some of the revenue applications would reduce the economy-wide costs from a carbon tax but may not eliminate them entirely. In addition, some studies cite particular economic modeling scenarios in which certain carbon tax revenue applications produce a net increase in GDP compared to a baseline scenario. These scenarios involve using carbon tax revenues to offset reductions in other tax rates (e.g., corporate income or payroll taxes). Although economic models generally indicate that these particular revenue applications would yield the greatest benefit to the economy overall, the models also find that lower-income households would likely face a disproportionate impact under such an approach. As lower-income households spend a greater proportion of their income on energy needs (electricity, gasoline), these households are expected to experience disproportionate impacts from a carbon tax if revenues were not recycled back to them in some fashion (e.g., lump-sum distribution). A price on GHG emissions could create a competitive disadvantage for some industries, particularly \"emission-intensive, trade-exposed industries.\" Policymakers have several options to address this concern, including establishing a \"border carbon adjustment\" program, which would levy a fee on imports from countries without comparable GHG reduction programs. Alternatively, policymakers could allocate (indefinitely or for a period of time) some of the carbon tax revenues to selected industry sectors or businesses. Relatedly, a carbon tax system is projected to disproportionately impact fossil fuel industries, particularly coal, and the communities that rely on their employment. To alleviate these impacts, policymakers may consider using some of the revenue to provide transition assistance to employees or affected communities."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8507}
{"pred": " The report discusses the financial challenges facing the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits (RHB) Fund, which is part of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). The RHB Fund, established under the 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA), is designed to prefund USPS's share of retiree health benefits. However, the fund is projected to be depleted by fiscal year 2030 due to USPS's failure to make required payments. The report highlights that USPS has missed over $38 billion in payments since 2010, and the fund's balance is declining. The RHB Fund is currently used by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to pay USPS's share of retiree health premiums, but this is not sustainable as USPS continues to miss payments. The report outlines several potential policy approaches to address the financial sustainability of the RHB Fund, including shifting costs to the federal government, reducing benefits, increasing payments from retirees and employees, changing the federal contribution to a fixed subsidy, establishing a voluntary employees' beneficiary association (VEBA), reducing the required level of prefunding, and investing outside the U.S. Treasury. The report emphasizes the need for congressional action to ensure the long-term viability of postal retiree health benefits and to prevent potential disruptions to these benefits. The report also notes that similar trends are observed in the private and public sectors, where many organizations are eliminating or reducing retiree health benefits due to financial constraints. The report concludes that without legislative action, the RHB Fund may be depleted, leading to significant financial and operational challenges for USPS and postal retirees.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report. Let me start by reading through the user's query again to make sure I understand what they need. They provided a detailed report about the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund (RHB Fund) and want a concise one-page summary. \n\nFirst, I should identify the main points of the report. The key elements are the structure of the RHB Fund, the financial issues it's facing, the reasons behind the funding problems, the potential policy solutions, and the implications if the fund isn't addressed. \n\nThe report starts by explaining that the RHB Fund is part of the FEHBP, which covers federal employees and retirees. USPS is responsible for a percentage of the premiums, the federal government contributes a prorated share, and retirees pay the rest. The 2006 PAEA changed the funding structure", "answers": ["USPS is required to prefund its share of health benefits costs for its retirees. To do so, USPS is required to make payments into the RHB Fund, which is administered by OPM. However, USPS has not made any payments to the fund since fiscal year 2010. At the end of fiscal year 2017, USPS had missed $38.2 billion in payments, leaving the fund 44 percent funded. Pursuant to law, beginning in fiscal year 2017, OPM started drawing from the fund to cover USPS's share of postal retirees' health benefits premiums. GAO was asked to review issues related to the sustainability of the RHB Fund. This report examines (1) the financial outlook for the RHB Fund and (2) policy approaches for postal retiree health benefits, among other topics. GAO evaluated financial projections for the RHB Fund from OPM. GAO reviewed laws and regulations and identified policy approaches primarily by identifying legislative proposals, and literature on actions of companies and state governments to address retiree health benefits. These approaches are not exhaustive or mutually exclusive. GAO also interviewed experts in retiree health benefits and postal stakeholders, chosen on the basis of relevant publications and prior GAO work, and interviewed and obtained written responses from OPM and USPS officials. The financial outlook of the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund (RHB Fund) is poor. At the end of fiscal year 2017, the fund's assets declined to $49.8 billion and unfunded liabilities rose to $62.2 billion. Based on Office of Personnel Management (OPM) projections requested by GAO, the fund is on track to be depleted in fiscal year 2030 if the United States Postal Service (USPS) continues to make no payments into the fund. Annual payments of $1 billion or $2 billion into the fund would extend the projected depletion date by 2 to 5 years (see figure). USPS has said that its required payments to the fund are unaffordable relative to its current financial situation and outlook. For the past 11 years USPS has incurred large operating losses that it expects will continue. Additionally, USPS has stated that its opportunities for revenue generation and cost-cutting are limited. USPS reported that it did not make required fund payments in 2017 in order to preserve liquidity and cover operational costs. If the fund becomes depleted, USPS would be required by law to make the payments necessary to cover its share of health benefits premiums for current postal retirees. Current law does not address what would happen if the fund becomes depleted and USPS does not make payments to cover those premiums. Depletion of the fund could affect postal retirees as well as USPS, customers, and other stakeholders, including the federal government. About 500,000 postal retirees receive health benefits and OPM expects that number to remain about the same through 2035. GAO identified three categories of policy approaches for postal retiree health benefits, based on legislative proposals and pertinent literature. First, some approaches, such as generally requiring eligible postal retirees to participate in Medicare, would shift costs to the federal government. Second, some approaches would reduce benefits or increase costs to postal retirees and/or employees. Third, some approaches would change how benefits are financed (see table). All of these approaches have different potential effects and would require congressional action. Thus, it is up to Congress to consider the merits of different approaches and determine the most appropriate action to take. It would be preferable to take action when careful consideration is possible, rather than wait until lack of adequate funding could disrupt postal retiree health benefits. Congress should consider passing legislation to put postal retiree health benefits on a more sustainable financial footing.

NAS results from maternal opioid use during pregnancy, including prescription medications, medication-assisted treatment, and illicit drug use. The report highlights that over 80% of NAS cases are covered by Medicaid, emphasizing the financial burden on the healthcare system. It outlines the current treatment approaches, which include non-pharmacologic methods like rooming-in, swaddling, and breastfeeding, as well as pharmacologic treatments such as methadone or morphine for severe cases. The report notes that while non-pharmacologic methods are recommended first, pharmacologic treatment may be necessary for moderate to severe symptoms. It also discusses the use of various scoring tools, such as the Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring Tool, to assess NAS severity. The report highlights the lack of a national standard of care for NAS and the need for more research on treatment effectiveness. It addresses the challenges in treating NAS, including maternal polysubstance use, stigma, limited hospital capacity, and coordination of care. The report also examines Medicaid payment structures, noting that costs vary based on treatment settings and that non-hospital settings like outpatient clinics and neonatal withdrawal centers offer alternative care options with potential cost savings. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has published strategies and resources to address NAS, including the Protecting Our Infants Act, which outlines 39 recommendations for prevention and treatment. However, the report criticizes HHS for lacking a clear implementation plan for these recommendations, which could hinder effective action. The report concludes with recommendations for HHS to develop a comprehensive plan with priorities, timelines, and accountability measures to address NAS effectively.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report on neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS).

It mentions different types of opioid use by mothers, like prescription medications, medication-assisted treatment, and illicit drugs. The report also states that over 80% of NAS cases are covered by Medicaid, which is a big financial burden.\n\nNext, the treatment approaches are discussed. Non-pharmacologic methods like rooming-in, swaddling, and breastfeeding are recommended first, followed by pharmacologic treatments if needed. There's mention of scoring tools like the Finnegan scale to assess severity. The lack of a national standard of care is noted", "answers": ["As the opioid crisis has increased in recent years, so has the number of pregnant women who use opioids, which can result in NAS. A recent peer-reviewed study found that cases of NAS have grown nearly five-fold between 2000 and 2012 and that most infants with NAS are covered under Medicaid. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 includes a provision for GAO to examine NAS in the United States and related treatment services covered under Medicaid. This report 1) describes the hospital and non-hospital settings for treating infants with NAS and how Medicaid pays for services, 2) describes recommended practices and challenges for addressing NAS, and 3) examines HHS's strategy for addressing NAS. GAO reviewed HHS documentation and interviewed HHS officials. GAO also conducted site visits to four states—Kentucky, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin—selected based on several factors, including incidence rates of NAS and geographic variation. GAO interviewed stakeholders from 32 organizations, including health care providers and state officials in the selected states. The prenatal use of opioids or other drugs can produce a withdrawal condition in newborns known as neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Health care providers, state officials, and other stakeholders told GAO that most infants with NAS are treated in the hospital—such as in a neonatal intensive care unit—though some may be referred to a non-hospital setting—such as a neonatal withdrawal center with nursery rooms—to complete their treatment. The table below provides more information on settings for treating infants with NAS and on how Medicaid pays for services in these settings. According to stakeholders GAO interviewed and literature reviewed, there are several recommended practices and challenges associated with addressing NAS. The most frequently recommended practices included prioritizing non-pharmacologic treatment to infants—treatment that does not involve medications—such as allowing the mother to reside with the infant during treatment; educating mothers and health care providers on treatment of NAS, among other things; and using a protocol in the hospital or non-hospital setting for screening and treating infants with NAS. The most frequently cited challenges included the maternal use of multiple drugs—or polysubstance use—as it can exacerbate NAS symptoms; stigma faced by pregnant women who use opioids; hospital staff burden and limited physical capacity to care for infants with NAS; limited coordination of care for mothers and infants with NAS; and gaps in research and data on NAS, such as research on the long-term effects of the condition. In May 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a strategy document that makes key recommendations to address NAS. The Strategy recommends, for example, that health care providers receive continuing education on managing and treating infants with NAS and promote non-pharmacologic treatment. According to HHS officials, these recommendations will inform planning and policy across the department. However, HHS has yet to determine how and when the recommendations will be implemented, including establishing priorities; the roles and responsibilities of other federal, state, and public stakeholders; implementation timeframes; and methods for assessing progress. HHS officials told GAO that they expect to develop an implementation plan sometime in 2017 but had no timeline for doing so. Without a plan that clearly specifies how HHS will implement the Strategy and assess its progress, the department increases the risk that its recommendations for addressing NAS will not be implemented. HHS should expeditiously develop a plan for implementing the recommendations included in its strategy related to addressing NAS. HHS concurred that it should expeditiously address NAS, but noted implementation of the strategy is contingent on funding."], "all_classes": null, "length": 9838}

It mentions existing sector-specific laws like the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and HIPAA. The FTC is the main agency handling Internet privacy issues using its authority under the FTC Act to address unfair and deceptive practices.

This disclosure followed other recent incidents involving the misuse of consumers' personal information from the Internet, which is used by about three-quarters of Americans. GAO was asked to review federal oversight of Internet privacy. This report addresses, among other objectives: (1) how FTC and FCC have overseen consumers' Internet privacy and (2) selected stakeholders' views on the strengths and limitations of how Internet privacy currently is overseen and how, if it all, this approach could be enhanced. GAO evaluated FTC and FCC Internet privacy enforcement actions and authorities and interviewed representatives from industry, consumer advocacy groups, and academia; FTC and FCC staff; former FTC and FCC commissioners; and officials from other federal oversight agencies. Industry stakeholders were selected to represent different sectors, and academics were selected because of their expertise in privacy, consumer protection, and regulatory issues. The United States does not have a comprehensive Internet privacy law governing the collection, use, and sale or other disclosure of consumers' personal information. At the federal level, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) currently has the lead in overseeing Internet privacy, using its statutory authority under the FTC Act to protect consumers from unfair and deceptive trade practices. However, to date FTC has not issued regulations for Internet privacy other than those protecting financial privacy and the Internet privacy of children, which were required by law. For FTC Act violations, FTC may promulgate regulations but is required to use procedures that differ from traditional notice-and-comment processes and that FTC staff said add time and complexity. In the last decade, FTC has filed 101 enforcement actions regarding Internet privacy; nearly all actions resulted in settlement agreements requiring action by the companies. In most of these cases, FTC did not levy civil penalties because it lacked such authority for those particular violations. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has had a limited role in overseeing Internet privacy. From 2015 to 2017, FCC asserted jurisdiction over the privacy practices of Internet service providers. In 2016, FCC promulgated privacy rules for Internet service providers that Congress later repealed. FTC resumed privacy oversight of Internet service providers in June 2018. Stakeholders GAO interviewed had varied views on the current Internet privacy enforcement approach and how it could be enhanced. Most Internet industry stakeholders said they favored FTC's current approach—direct enforcement of its unfair and deceptive practices statutory authority, rather than promulgating and enforcing regulations implementing that authority. These stakeholders said that the current approach allows for flexibility and that regulations could hinder innovation. Other stakeholders, including consumer advocates and most former FTC and FCC commissioners GAO interviewed, favored having FTC issue and enforce regulations. Some stakeholders said a new data-protection agency was needed to oversee consumer privacy. Stakeholders identified three main areas in which Internet privacy oversight could be enhanced: Statute . Some stakeholders told GAO that an overarching Internet privacy statute could enhance consumer protection by clearly articulating to consumers, industry, and agencies what behaviors are prohibited. Rulemaking . Some stakeholders said that regulations can provide clarity, enforcement fairness, and flexibility. Officials from two other consumer protection agencies said their rulemaking authority assists in their oversight efforts and works together with enforcement actions. Civil penalty authority.

Comprehensive Internet privacy legislation that establishes specific standards and includes traditional notice-and-comment rulemaking and broader civil penalty authority could enhance the federal government's ability to protect consumer privacy.

Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. \n\nThe report is about the FBI's headquarters facilities, specifically the Hoover Building, and the challenges they face. The key issues mentioned are security, space, and building condition. The FBI has outgrown the Hoover Building, leading to annexes in various locations, which create security concerns, especially in multitenant buildings. There's also mention of foreign-owned spaces, which pose security risks. \n\nIn terms of space, the Hoover Building's design is outdated and inefficient, making it hard to reconfigure for modern needs. The building's condition is deteriorating, and GSA has limited investments to maintain safety, which could lead to more problems. The FBI has been working on a consolidation project, but funding issues caused the cancellation of the procurement in 2017. \n\nThen there's the part about GSA's swap exchange approach for federal properties. They tried using swap exchanges to modernize buildings but faced challenges like lack of market interest, valuation issues, and incomplete details in solicitations. They had some successes with small projects but larger ones were abandoned. GSA is trying to improve the process but still faces obstacles. \n\nThe report also discusses alternative funding mechanisms for real property projects, like upfront funding, retained fees, land swaps, and public-private partnerships. However, these come with risks that need to be managed. The conclusion is that while there are options, the budget structure might need changes to help agencies meet their real property needs more effectively.\n\nNow, I need to condense all this into a one-page summary. I should start with the main findings about the FBI's headquarters issues, then move to GSA's swap exchanges, and finally the alternative funding mechanisms. I need to make sure each section is concise, using bullet points or short paragraphs. Also, check for key dates and specific numbers, like the 2.4 million square feet, the 2017 cancellation, and the swap exchange examples. Avoid too much detail but include the main points. Make sure the summary is double-spaced, 12-point font, with 1-inch margins. Let me structure it with an introduction, sections on FBI's challenges, GSA's swap exchanges, alternative funding, and a conclusion. Keep each section brief.

One type of transaction, called a swap exchange, enables GSA to apply the value of federal property to finance construction without relying on appropriated funds. Under such an exchange, GSA transfers the title of the unneeded property to a private investor after receiving the agreed upon construction services at another location. GSA proposed a swap exchange procurement for construction of a new FBI headquarters building in exchange for the Hoover Building and appropriations to compensate for the difference in value between the Hoover Building and the new building. GSA cancelled this procurement in July 2017 due to lack of funding. This statement addresses (1) GSA's and FBI's assessments of the Hoover Building, (2) GSA efforts to implement swap exchanges, and (3) alternative approaches to funding real property projects. It is based on GAO's body of reports on real property from 2011 to 2017, and selected updates from GSA. In November 2011, GAO reported that, according to General Services Administration (GSA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) assessments, the FBI's headquarters building (Hoover Building) and its accompanying facilities in Washington, D.C., did not fully support the FBI's long-term security, space, and building condition requirements. Since GAO's report, the assessments have not materially changed, for example: Security: GAO's prior work noted that the dispersion of staff in annexes creates security challenges, including where some space was leased by the FBI and other space was leased by nonfederal tenants. Earlier this year, GAO reported the FBI is leasing space in D.C. from foreign owners. Space : In 2011, GAO reported that FBI and GSA studies showed that much of the Hoover Building is unusable. GSA noted in its fiscal year 2017 project prospectus for the FBI headquarters consolidation that the Hoover Building cannot be redeveloped to meet the FBI's current needs. Building Condition: In GAO's 2011 report, GAO noted that the condition of the Hoover Building was deteriorating, and GSA assessments identified significant recapitalization needs. Since GAO's report and in response to GAO's recommendation, GSA has evaluated its approach to maintaining the building and completed some repairs to ensure safety. GSA has limited experience in successfully completing swap exchange transactions and chose not to pursue several proposed swap exchanges, most recently the planned swap exchange for the Hoover Building. GSA has developed criteria for determining when to solicit market interest in a swap exchange, in response to recommendations in GAO's 2014 report. In addition, GSA officials told GAO that they planned to improve the swap exchange process, including the property appraisal process, outreach to stakeholders to identify potential risks associated with future projects, and to the extent possible, mitigate such risks. Nevertheless, several factors may continue to limit use of swap exchanges, including market factors, such as the availability of alternative properties and an investor's approach for valuing properties. For example, in reviewing a proposed swap exchange in Washington, D.C., GAO found in a 2016 report that the proposals from two firms valued the two federal buildings involved in the proposed swap substantially less than GSA's appraised property value. In a 2014 report, GAO identified a number of alternative approaches to funding real property projects. Congress has provided some agencies with specific authorities to use alternative funding mechanisms—including the use of private sector funds or land swaps—for the acquisition, renovation, or disposal of federal real property without full, upfront funding, though GAO has previously reported that upfront funding is the best way to ensure recognition of commitments made in budgeting decisions and maintain fiscal controls. GAO has reported that projects with alternative funding mechanisms present multiple forms of risk that are shared between the agency and any partner or stakeholder. In addition, alternative budgetary structures could be established, such as changing existing or introducing new account structures to fund real property projects. GAO has made recommendations in the past to GSA on various real property issues, including to develop additional guidance for swap exchanges and to evaluate its approach to maintaining the Hoover Building. GSA agreed with these two recommendations and addressed them."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2284}

There are different programs like UC, EB, UCFE, and UCX. UC is the main program with up to 26 weeks of benefits, and EB can extend that if certain economic conditions are met. But as of the report's date, no state is in an active EB period. \n\nThen there's a section about the legal framework, mentioning the Social Security Act of 1935 and the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 1991. It explains that states have their own programs, leading to 53 different systems. Eligibility is based on wages and employment in the base period, and states have different methods for determining benefits. The UC program is funded by FUTA and SUTA taxes, with FUTA being 0.6% on the first $7,000 of wages. \n\nThere's a part about the sequester affecting some UI expenditures, especially EB, but not regular UC, UCX, or UCFE. Then there's a discussion about the government shutdown in 2018-2019 and how furloughed federal employees might be eligible for UCFE benefits, though there are complexities with overpayments and state laws. \n\nThe report also mentions the RESEA program funded by DOL to help with reemployment services and preventing overpayments.

The lapse in federal appropriations that occurred from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019, created a partial government shutdown. As a result, agencies without funding furloughed many federal employees, and many federal employees excepted from furlough were working without pay during the lapse in appropriations. Furloughed federal employees may be eligible for UCFE benefits. Private-sector workers who are furloughed or laid off due to the partial government shutdown because they were employed by government contractors may be eligible for regular UC benefits. But, according to guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), excepted federal employees who are performing services (without pay) would generally be ineligible for UCFE benefits based on states' definitions of \"unemployment.\" In this climate, there has been congressional interest in assisting furloughed and excepted federal employees through the UI system. UI legislative issues currently facing the 116th Congress include the following: the effects of the FY2019 sequester order on UI programs and benefits, the role of UI in providing temporary income replacement during a government shutdown, state fiscal concerns related to financing UC benefits, reemployment services and eligibility assessments (RESEA), potential consideration of the UI proposals included in the President's FY2020 budget, and congressional oversight related to a proposed UC drug testing rule reissued by DOL after previously being disapproved using the Congressional Review Act.

{"pred": " The report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) examines the Federal Bureau of Prisons' (BOP) use of retention incentives, internal controls, and strategic planning related to these incentives. The BOP, under the oversight of the Department of Justice's Justice Management Division (JMD), manages human resources, including retention incentives, to retain staff. Retention incentives are authorized by the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 and the Federal Workforce Flexibility Act of 2004, allowing up to 50% of an employee's basic pay as an incentive. These incentives are used to retain employees with high qualifications or critical needs, requiring performance ratings of at least \"fully successful.\" BOP funds these incentives primarily through its Salaries and Expenses account, with expenditures increasing from $10.7 million in 2012 to $14.0 million in 2016. The majority of these funds were allocated to four California institutions and medical professionals nationwide. The report highlights that retention incentives are used to address staffing challenges, particularly in California where BOP salaries are lower than state and local prisons, and for medical professionals facing private sector competition. Internal controls are in place, including multi-level review processes and annual re-certification, ensuring compliance with OPM regulations. However, BOP lacks a strategic human capital plan to guide the use of retention incentives, relying instead on ad hoc decisions based on immediate needs. The GAO recommends that BOP include retention incentives in its strategic plan and evaluate their effectiveness to better align with long-term human capital goals. The report also notes that BOP has not evaluated the effectiveness of retention incentives, despite their significant cost, and suggests that such evaluations could improve the strategic use of these incentives to retain staff effectively.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this GAO report on the Federal Bureau of Prisons' use of retention incentives. Let me start by understanding the key points from the report.\n\nFirst, the report is about how BOP uses retention incentives to retain staff. The BOP is under DOJ's JMD, which oversees their human resources. Retention incentives are allowed by certain laws, up to 50% of pay, for critical employees. They need performance ratings and documentation. The funding comes from the Salaries and Expenses account, with spending increasing from 2012 to 2016. Most of the money went to four California institutions and medical professionals. \n\nThe report mentions that in California,", "answers": ["BOP is the largest employer within DOJ and is responsible for the care and custody of an inmate population of about 186,000. BOP has faced challenges retaining staff at correctional facilities, although it has used retention incentives, along with other human capital flexibilities. GAO was asked to review BOP's use of retention incentives. This report addresses: (1) how BOP used its authority to pay retention incentives; (2) internal controls BOP has in place for the use of retention incentives; and (3) the extent to which BOP plans for and evaluates the use of retention incentives. GAO obtained employee-level retention incentive expenditure data from DOJ's Justice Management Division for fiscal years 2012 through 2016. GAO also reviewed agency documentation, such as policy statements and 40 randomly selected retention incentive application packet case files from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. GAO also interviewed officials from BOP's Central Office and four correctional facilities that use retention incentives, selected to reflect variation in the number and types of employees receiving retention incentives, BOP regions, and BOP institution security levels. From fiscal years 2012 to 2016, the Department of Justice's (DOJ) Federal Bureau of Prisons' (BOP) total retention incentive expenditures generally increased from $10.7 to $14.0 million and the number of employees receiving retention incentives increased from 2,024 to 2,460. During those five years, BOP spent more than 97 percent of its total retention incentive expenditures on employees at four BOP institutions in California and for medical professionals nationwide. Further, total retention incentive expenditures for medical professionals increased by an average of 21 percent per year (see figure). According to BOP officials, BOP uses retention incentives, for example, to supplement BOP's medical professionals' salaries which are generally lower than private sector salaries. BOP has a variety of internal controls in place throughout the retention incentive process that help ensure retention incentive applications and approvals meet requirements. For example, each application goes through multiple levels of review to verify its accuracy and completeness. BOP takes steps to determine workforce needs and how to fill those needs, but has not strategically planned for and evaluated its use of retention incentives. According to BOP, planning for human capital needs is conducted at institutions during quarterly meetings, but discussions about these incentives respond to short-term staffing situations rather than proactively addressing future staffing needs. Including human capital goals and strategies in BOP's human capital plan would create a roadmap so the agency could move from being reactive to its current workforce needs to being strategic in trying to achieve its long-term workforce goals. Additionally BOP has not evaluated the effectiveness of its use of retention incentives in retaining staff. As a result, BOP does not know whether retention incentives have contributed to employees' retention in relation to other incentives used by BOP. Consistent with key principles for strategic human capital planning, planning for and evaluating the use of retention incentives could help BOP better determine if these incentives are an efficient and effective means by which to retain staff. GAO recommends that BOP (1) include human capital goals and how retention incentives will be used to achieve these goals in its human capital plan; and (2) evaluate the use of retention incentives.

{"pred": " \n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) plays a critical role in managing vehicle safety defect recalls, ensuring that consumers are informed of potential safety risks and that manufacturers address these issues. The report highlights the increasing number of safety defect recalls since 2011, driven by large-scale events such as the 2014 General Motors ignition switch recall and the ongoing Takata airbag inflator recall, which has affected over 34 million vehicles. NHTSA oversees these recalls, requiring manufacturers to notify consumers via mail and provide remedies without charge, with franchised dealers performing the repairs. The agency has also initiated efforts to improve recall completion rates, aiming for a 100% completion rate through enhanced communication and coordination with the auto industry.\n\nDespite these efforts, recall completion rates have remained relatively flat, ranging from 63% to 67% between 2011 and 2014. To improve consumer engagement, NHTSA and manufacturers provide recall information online, including VIN lookup tools and e-mail notifications. However, the report identifies usability challenges with NHTSA.gov, particularly in locating recall information and completing tasks such as VIN searches. Consumers often prefer electronic notifications, but many do not receive them, creating a gap between preferences and current practices. NHTSA has launched initiatives like the Safe Cars Save Lives campaign and a pilot program for state vehicle registration to raise awareness and improve recall completion.\n\nThe report also emphasizes the importance of addressing usability issues on NHTSA.gov, as these can hinder consumers' ability to access critical recall information. While NHTSA has made strides in consolidating its website and improving its design, the agency has not yet set a completion date for its website consolidation efforts, which could delay further improvements. The report concludes with two recommendations: setting a completion date for the website consolidation and taking interim steps to enhance the usability of the auto recall areas of NHTSA.gov. These steps are essential to ensure that consumers can effectively access and use recall information, ultimately improving vehicle safety and recall completion rates.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report about NHTSA's vehicle recall processes. Let me start by understanding the main points. The report discusses how NHTSA handles safety defect recalls, the increase in recalls since 2011, the role of manufacturers and dealers, the challenges in consumer notification, and the efforts to improve recall completion rates. \n\nFirst, I should mention the key statistics, like the rise in recalls, the", "answers": ["The number of vehicles affected by safety defect recalls increased sharply in recent years—from nearly 13 million in 2011 to over 51 million in 2016. Once a defect is identified, auto manufacturers are required to send written notification to vehicle owners by mail. NHTSA also aims to enhance awareness of auto recalls by providing information on its website, NHTSA.gov . The Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act includes a provision requiring GAO to study the use of publicly available safety recall information. This report addresses: (1) how consumers and industry stakeholders use such information and (2) how easy to use do consumers find the auto recall areas of NHTSA.gov, among other objectives. To understand consumers' use of auto recall information and to test website usability, GAO conducted 12 focus groups with 94 consumers who had a recall. Focus groups were held in six locations selected for population and geographic variation. GAO identified key website usability practices and requested an evaluation by website usability professionals. GAO reviewed statutes, regulations, and NHTSA documents, and interviewed industry stakeholders—including 10 manufacturers selected based on sales market share and other factors. Consumers, manufacturers, and auto dealers use publicly available auto recall information differently. For example, the 94 consumers in 12 focus groups that GAO conducted used this information to decide whether to repair their vehicles. These consumers overwhelmingly cited safety risk and convenience as the two most influential factors they considered. Most consumers reported a preference for receiving recall notification by at least one electronic means, such as by e-mail or text message, in addition to mail. However, only 7 of 94 consumers reported receiving electronic notifications, suggesting a gap between the industry's auto recall notification practices and consumers' preferences. (See fig.). In response to a mandate in law, in September 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a proposed rule that, if finalized, would require manufacturers to notify consumers about auto recalls by electronic means in addition to mail. Most consumers in GAO's focus group website usability tests found the auto recall areas of NHTSA's website—NHTSA.gov—easy to use; however, some consumers experienced difficulties when asked to complete auto recall related tasks. For example, when consumers attempted to search for recalls affecting their specific vehicles, some found the search results confusing, leading them to question the accuracy of the results. Similarly, some consumers were hampered in searching for recalls by their vehicles' year, make, and model because the website did not always display model options using plain language. GAO found that the auto recall areas of NHTSA.gov do not always reflect federal and industry key website usability practices, and that an independent evaluation conducted by website usability professionals at GAO's request identified similar issues. NHTSA is in the process of consolidating its websites and plans to conduct a website usability study of NHTSA.gov with consumers after the consolidation is complete. However, the agency has not determined a completion date for the consolidation effort—an essential step for organizations to effectively guide their information technology efforts. Without establishing a completion date and taking interim steps to improve the usability of NHTSA.gov, consumers will likely continue to experience difficulties, which may limit the effectiveness of the website's primary means of providing consumers with information about recalls affecting their vehicles.

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points. \n\nFirst, the report explains what cluster munitions are. They disperse submunitions in mid-air, which can be delivered by aircraft or ground systems. They're used for their ability to target multiple areas with fewer weapons, making them an \"economy of force\" weapon. But there are issues with their use, like the high failure rate of submunitions and the lingering unexploded ordnance (UXO) that poses long-term hazards. \n\nThe report mentions historical use in various conflicts, like World War II, Southeast Asia, Afghanistan, the Gulf War, and the Balkans. There are specific examples, like the U.S. use in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the 2006 Israeli use in Lebanon, which caused significant casualties and contamination. The failure rates are a big concern, with discrepancies between manufacturers and mine clearance experts. Some submunitions are \"dumb\" and don't have self-destruct features, leading to long-term risks. \n\nThen there's the international response. The Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) was created in 2008, banning their use, production, etc., but the U.S., Russia, China, and others didn't sign. The U.S. has a policy that allows continued use with certain restrictions, like the 1% UXO standard after 2018. The 2017 policy revised this, allowing more flexibility but still requiring replacement with safer munitions. \n\nThe report also discusses the military utility of cluster munitions, their role in reducing the number of weapons needed, and the potential for precision weapons to replace them. There's a mention of the U.S. military suspending use in Iraq and Afghanistan, but resuming under certain conditions. The DOD's revised policy allows combatant commanders to use older munitions in extreme situations, which raises questions about operational planning and international perceptions. \n\nI need to condense all this into a one-page summary.

Cluster munitions have been highly criticized internationally for causing a significant number of civilian deaths, and efforts have been undertaken to ban and regulate their use.

In November 2017, a new DOD policy was issued that essentially reversed the 2008 policy. Under the new policy, combatant commanders can use cluster munitions that do not meet the 1% or less unexploded submunitions standard in extreme situations to meet immediate warfighting demands. In addition, the new policy does not establish a deadline to replace cluster munitions exceeding the 1% rate and states that DOD \"will retain cluster munitions currently in active inventories until the capabilities they provide are replaced with enhanced and more reliable munitions.\" Potential issues for Congress include cluster munitions in an era of precision weapons, other weapons in lieu of cluster munitions, and the potential impact of DOD's 2017 revised cluster munitions policy."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3162}

Further, costs are rising with disasters, such as Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in 2017. FEMA recently redesigned how the PA program delivers assistance to state and local grantees to improve operations and address past challenges identified by GAO and others. FEMA tested the new delivery model in selected disasters and announced implementation in September 2017. GAO was asked to assess the redesigned PA program. This report examines, among other things, the extent to which FEMA's new delivery model addresses (1) past workforce management challenges and assesses future workforce needs; and (2) past information sharing challenges and key IT management controls. GAO reviewed FEMA policy, strategy, and implementation documents; interviewed FEMA and state officials, PA program applicants, and other stakeholders; and observed implementation of the new model at one test location following Hurricane Matthew in 2016. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) redesigned the Public Assistance (PA) grant program delivery model to address past challenges in workforce management, but has not fully assessed future workforce staffing needs. GAO and others have previously identified challenges related to shortages in experienced and trained FEMA PA staff and high turnover among these staff. These challenges often led to applicants receiving inconsistent guidance and to PA project delays. As part of its new model, FEMA is creating consolidated resource centers to standardize and centralize PA staff responsible for managing grant applications, and new specialized positions, such as hazard mitigation liaisons, program delivery managers, and site inspectors, to ensure more consistent guidance to applicants. However, FEMA has not assessed the workforce needed to fully implement the new model, such as the number of staff needed to fill certain new positions, or to achieve staffing goals for supporting hazard mitigation on PA projects. Fully assessing workforce needs will help to ensure that FEMA has the people and the skills needed to fully implement the new PA model and help to avoid the long-standing workforce challenges the program encountered in the past. FEMA designed a new PA information and case management system—called the FEMA Applicant Case Tracker (FAC-Trax)—to address past information sharing challenges, such as difficulties in sharing grant documentation among FEMA, state, and local officials and tracking the status of PA projects, but additional actions could better ensure effective implementation. Both FEMA and state officials involved in testing of the new model stated that the new information system allows them to better manage and track PA applications and documentation, which could lead to greater transparency and efficiencies in the program. Further, GAO found that this new system fully addresses two of four key information technology (IT) management controls—project planning and risk management—that are necessary to ensure systems work effectively and meet user needs. However, GAO found that FEMA has not fully addressed the other two controls—requirements development and systems testing and integration. By better analyzing progress on high-level user requirements, for example, FEMA will have greater assurance that FAC-Trax will meet user needs and achieve the goals of the new delivery model.

DOE typically accounts for about 80% of the bill's funding. President Trump submitted his FY2020 detailed budget proposal to Congress on March 18, 2019 (after submitting a general budget overview on March 11). The budget requests for agencies included in the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill total $38.02 billion—$6.64 billion (15%) below the FY2019 appropriation. The largest exception to the overall decrease proposed for energy and water programs is a $1.309 billion increase (12%) for DOE nuclear weapons activities. For FY2019, the conference agreement on H.R. 5895 (H.Rept. 115-929) provided total Energy and Water Development appropriations of $44.66 billion—3% above the FY2018 level, excluding supplemental funding, and 23% above the FY2019 request. It was signed by the President on September 21, 2018 (P.L. 115-244). Emergency supplemental appropriations totaling $17.419 billion were provided to USACE and DOE for hurricane response by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123), signed February 9, 2018. Major Energy and Water Development funding issues for FY2020 are listed below. They were selected based on the total funding involved, the percentage of proposed increases or decreases, and potential impact on broader public policy considerations. Water Agency Funding Reductions. The Trump Administration requested reductions of 31% for USACE and 29% for Reclamation for FY2020 from the FY2019 enacted levels. The largest reductions would be from USACE Operation and Maintenance (-48%) and Reclamation's Water and Related Resources account (-31%). Similar reductions proposed by the Administration for FY2019 were not enacted. Power Marketing Administration (PMA) Reforms. DOE's FY2020 budget request includes mandatory proposals to sell PMA electricity transmission lines and other assets, repeal certain PMA borrowing authority, and eliminate cost-based limits on the electricity rates charged by the PMAs. The proposals would need to be enacted in authorizing legislation. Termination of Energy Efficiency Grants. DOE's Weatherization Assistance Program and State Energy Program would be terminated under the FY2020 budget request. The Administration had proposed to eliminate the grants in FY2018 and FY2019, but Congress continued funding. Reductions in Energy Research and Development. Under the FY2020 budget request, DOE research and development appropriations would be reduced for energy efficiency and renewable energy (EERE) by 83%, nuclear energy by 38%, and fossil energy by 24%. Similar reductions proposed by the Administration for FY2019 were not enacted. Nuclear Waste Repository. The Administration's budget request would provide new funding for the first time since FY2010 for a proposed nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, NV. DOE would receive $116 million to seek an NRC license for the repository and develop interim waste storage capacity. NRC would receive $38.5 million to consider DOE's repository license application. Similar Administration funding requests for FY2018 and FY2019 were not enacted. Elimination of Advanced Research Projects Agency—Energy (ARPA-E). The Trump Administration proposes no new appropriations for ARPA-E in FY2020 and to cancel $287 million in unobligated balances from previous appropriations. Similar proposals to terminate ARPA-E in FY2018 and FY2019 were not enacted. Loan Programs Termination. The FY2020 budget request would terminate DOE's Title 17 Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program, the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, and the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program. Administration proposals to eliminate the programs were not included in the enacted appropriations measures for FY2018 and FY2019. Weapons Activities. The FY2020 budget request for DOE Weapons Activities is 12% greater than it was in FY2019 ($12.4 billion vs. $11.1 billion), in contrast to a proposed 10% reduction in DOE's total funding. Notable proposed increases would be used for warhead life extension programs and preparations for increase production of plutonium pits (warhead cores)."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8323}

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nFirst, the PSOB program provides cash benefits to public safety officers who are killed or permanently disabled in the line of duty. The PSOEA program helps their children and spouses with education. Both are administered by the DOJ's Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA). The report mentions the FY2019 benefit amounts: $359,316 lump sum for PSOB and $1,224 monthly for PSOEA. These are indexed for cost of living. \n\nEligibility for PSOB includes various roles like law enforcement, firefighters, emergency management employees, and EMS workers. The definition of a public agency is broad, covering federal, state, local, and tribal entities. The injury must be directly from an external cause, not occupational diseases or stress-related conditions, except for certain cardiovascular issues during emergencies. \n\nThe benefits are paid if the injury occurs in the line of duty, which includes responding to emergencies, commuting, or activities related to their role. There are specific rules about when benefits are paid, like the three-year deadline for applications. Also, there's an expedited process for terrorism-related incidents. \n\nFor PSOEA, the spouse or child can get education assistance up to age 27, with possible extensions. The benefits are tied to the GI Bill's DEA program, and there are rules about eligibility, like not being in default on loans or having drug convictions. \n\nThe report also covers the application process, appeals, and legal aspects, including attorney fees. Funding is through annual appropriations, with mandatory spending for death benefits and discretionary for disability and PSOEA. \n\nNow, I need to condense all this into a one-page summary. I should start with an introduction about the programs, their purpose, and the administering agency.

The Public Safety Officers' Educational Assistance (PSOEA) program, a component of the PSOB program, provides higher-education assistance to the children and spouses of public safety officers killed or permanently disabled in the line of duty. The PSOB and PSOEA programs are administered by the Department of Justice (DOJ), Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA). However, claimants dissatisfied with denials of benefits may pursue administrative appeals within DOJ and may seek judicial review before the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Each year, Congress appropriates funding for PSOB death benefits, which is considered mandatory spending, and for PSOB disability benefits and PSOEA benefits, which is subject to annual appropriations. For FY2019, the one-time lump-sum PSOB death and disability benefit is $359,316 and the PSOEA monthly benefit for a student attending an educational institution full-time is $1,224.

{"pred": " The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a division of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), plays a critical role in disease prevention, public health monitoring, and responding to health threats. The agency relies on a robust information technology (IT) infrastructure to support its mission, with approximately 20,000 employees and a $12 billion annual budget. However, a 2018 report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) highlighted significant vulnerabilities in the CDC’s information security program and technical controls, despite the agency’s efforts to implement safeguards. The report found that while the CDC had developed policies and procedures to manage cybersecurity risks, it had not consistently or effectively implemented them, leaving sensitive health and biological data at risk of unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification.\n\nKey findings included deficiencies in the agency’s risk assessments, access controls, encryption, configuration management, and incident response capabilities. For example, the CDC failed to properly categorize systems based on their risk levels, leading to insecure configurations where high-impact systems relied on lower-risk general support systems. The agency also struggled with timely patching, secure password management, and inadequate logging and monitoring of network activities. Additionally, the CDC’s security training programs were insufficient, with many staff members not receiving required role-based training within the mandated timeframes.\n\nThe GAO report recommended 195 actions to strengthen the CDC’s cybersecurity posture, including improving access controls, encrypting sensitive data, and enhancing monitoring and incident response capabilities. As of August 2018, the CDC had implemented 102 of the 184 technical control recommendations, with plans to address the remaining issues by 2020. However, the agency had not fully resolved the 11 program-related recommendations, such as updating risk assessments and documenting cost-benefit analyses for alternate site locations.\n\nThe report emphasized the need for the CDC to consistently and effectively implement its information security program to protect its critical systems and sensitive data. While the agency has made progress, ongoing efforts are necessary to address the identified vulnerabilities and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information systems.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of the given report about the CDC's information security. Let me start by understanding the main points. The report is from the GAO, right? They evaluated the CDC's cybersecurity measures. The CDC is part of HHS and has a big role in public health. They use a lot of IT systems, with around 20,", "answers": ["CDC is responsible for detecting and responding to emerging health threats and controlling dangerous substances. In carrying out its mission, CDC relies on information technology systems to receive, process, and maintain sensitive data. Accordingly, effective information security controls are essential to ensure that the agency's systems and information are protected from misuse and modification. GAO was asked to examine information security at CDC. In June 2018, GAO issued a limited official use only report on the extent to which CDC had effectively implemented technical controls and an information security program to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information on selected information systems. This current report is a public version of the June 2018 report. In addition, for this public report, GAO determined the extent to which CDC has taken corrective actions to address the previously identified security program and technical control deficiencies and related recommendations for improvement. For this report, GAO reviewed supporting documents regarding CDC's actions on previously identified recommendations and interviewed personnel at CDC. As GAO reported in June 2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) implemented technical controls and an information security program that were intended to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information systems and information. However, GAO identified control and program deficiencies in the core security functions related to identifying risk, protecting systems from threats and vulnerabilities, detecting and responding to cyber security events, and recovering system operations (see table below). GAO made 195 recommendations to address these deficiencies. As of August 2018, CDC had made significant progress in resolving many of the security deficiencies by implementing 102 of 184 (about 55 percent) technical control recommendations, and partially implementing 1 of 11 information security program recommendations made in the June 2018 report. The figure shows the status of CDC's efforts to implement the 195 recommendations. Additionally, CDC has created remedial action plans to implement the majority of the remaining open recommendations by September 2019. Until CDC implements these recommendations and resolves the associated deficiencies, its information systems and information will remain at increased risk of misuse, improper disclosure or modification, and destruction."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10203}

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report starts by explaining that in March 2015, Saudi Arabia formed a coalition to fight the Houthi movement in Yemen. The U.S. joined initially, providing logistical and intelligence support without direct military action. There was a joint planning cell between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. Then, Congress became involved, debating various aspects of U.S. policy. They considered legislation to reduce civilian casualties, improve humanitarian conditions, and address Iran's support for the Houthis. The conflict was viewed through a regional lens, with some lawmakers seeing it as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, while others were concerned about the U.S.-Saudi relationship, especially after the Jamal Khashoggi incident.\n\nOver time, Congress passed some resolutions to condition arms sales and limit U.S. support, but these weren't enacted. The Obama administration faced pressure to limit arms sales and intelligence sharing, especially after the 2016 airstrike that killed 140 people. The Trump administration reversed some of these restrictions, pushing for more arms sales to Saudi Arabia. There were debates in Congress about using the War Powers Resolution to end U.S. support, but the Senate passed a resolution in 2018 directing the President to remove U.S. forces from Yemen, except for counterterrorism operations. The conflict led to a humanitarian crisis, with famine threats, and eventually, a UN-brokered ceasefire in 2018. The report ends by noting ongoing congressional debates and the need for sustained international attention on Yemen.\n\nNow, I need to condense this into a one-page summary. I should start with the main events: the coalition's formation, U.S. involvement, congressional debates, key legislative actions, the humanitarian crisis, and the eventual ceasefire. I need to mention the shift from Obama to Trump administrations, the role of Congress in oversight, and the impact of the Khashoggi incident. Also, highlight the bipartisan nature of some debates and the unresolved issues regarding U.S. support and Yemen's future.\n\nI should structure the summary with an introduction, key developments, congressional actions, humanitarian aspects, and the conclusion with the current state of the conflict.

Summary tables provide information on legislative proposals considered in the 115th and 116th Congresses. Various legislative proposals have reflected a range of congressional perspectives and priorities, including with regard to the authorization of the activities of the U.S. Armed Forces related to the conflict; the extent of U.S. logistical, material, advisory, and intelligence support for the coalition led by Saudi Arabia; the approval, disapproval, or conditioning of U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia; the appropriation of funds for U.S. operations in support of the Saudi-led coalition; the conduct of the Saudi-led coalition's air campaign and its adherence to international humanitarian law and the laws of armed conflict; the demand for greater humanitarian access to Yemen; the call for a wider government assessment of U.S. policy toward Yemen and U.S. support to parties to the conflict; the nature and extent of U.S.-Saudi counterterrorism and border security cooperation; and the role of Iran in supplying missile technology and other weapons to the forces of the Houthi movement. The 116th Congress may continue to debate U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition and Saudi Arabia's conduct of the war in Yemen, where fighting has continued since March 2015. The war has exacerbated a humanitarian crisis in Yemen that began in 2011; presently, the World Food Program reports that 20 million Yemenis face hunger in the absence of sustained food assistance. The difficulty of accessing certain areas of Yemen has made it hard for governments and aid agencies to count the war's casualties. Data collected by the U.S. and European-funded Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) suggest that 60,000 Yemenis have been killed since January 2016. The Trump Administration has opposed various congressional proposals, including initiatives to reject or condition proposed U.S. arms sales or to require an end to U.S. military support to Saudi-led coalition operations in Yemen. Many in Congress have condemned the October 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi government personnel, and in general, the incident appears to have exacerbated existing congressional concerns about Saudi leaders and the pace, scope, and direction of change in the kingdom's policies.
