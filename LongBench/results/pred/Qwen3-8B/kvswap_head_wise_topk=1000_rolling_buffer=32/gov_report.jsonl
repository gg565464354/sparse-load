{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points. The report is about multiyear procurement (MYP) and block buy contracting (BBC) as special mechanisms used by the Department of Defense (DOD). It explains how these differ from annual contracting and discusses potential issues for Congress regarding their use.\n\nFirst, the report mentions that MYP and BBC can reduce procurement costs by a few to several percent compared to annual contracting. However, actual savings are hard to measure due to various factors. The report also differentiates between funding approaches (like traditional full funding, incremental funding, and advance appropriations) and contracting mechanisms (like MYP and BBC). \n\nMYP involves a single contract for two to five years of procurement, which can lead to savings through contractor optimization and economic order quantity purchases. The report explains that MYP requires congressional approval and has a permanent statute (10 U.S.C. 2306b) that outlines the criteria for using MYP. These criteria include significant savings, realistic cost estimates, stable need, and stable design. \n\nBBC is similar to MYP but lacks a permanent statute, which means it's more flexible in terms of use. However, this flexibility can lead to less oversight. The report also mentions that the Coast Guard could benefit from using MYP and BBC, as they have not done so in their shipbuilding programs. \n\nPotential issues for Congress include whether to use MYP and BBC more, less, or about as frequently as now. There's also a discussion on whether to create a permanent statute for BBC, similar to MYP. The report highlights that while MYP has been used in some programs, BBC has been used less frequently, and the savings from BBC depend on whether EOQ is included. \n\nThe report also discusses the differences between MYP and BBC, such as the need for a permanent statute for MYP, the inclusion of cancellation penalties in MYP, and the flexibility in funding for BBC. Additionally, the report notes that the Air Force's EELV contract is sometimes referred to as a block buy, but it's not an example of BBC as discussed in the report. \n\nThe report further explains that using MYP can reduce flexibility for making procurement changes in response to changing strategic or budgetary circumstances. Congress's decisions on these issues could affect defense acquisition practices, defense funding requirements, and the defense industrial base. \n\nThe report also provides information on", "answers": ["Multiyear procurement (MYP) and block buy contracting (BBC) are special contracting mechanisms that Congress permits the Department of Defense (DOD) to use for a limited number of defense acquisition programs. Compared to the standard or default approach of annual contracting, MYP and BBC have the potential for reducing weapon procurement costs by a few or several percent. Under annual contracting, DOD uses one or more contracts for each year's worth of procurement of a given kind of item. Under MYP, DOD instead uses a single contract for two to five years' worth of procurement of a given kind of item without having to exercise a contract option for each year after the first year. DOD needs congressional approval for each use of MYP. There is a permanent statute governing MYP contracting—10 U.S.C. 2306b. Under this statute, a program must meet several criteria to qualify for MYP. Compared with estimated costs under annual contracting, estimated savings for programs being proposed for MYP have ranged from less than 5% to more than 15%, depending on the particulars of the program in question, with many estimates falling in the range of 5% to 10%. In practice, actual savings from using MYP rather than annual contracting can be difficult to observe or verify because of cost growth during the execution of the contract due to changes in the program independent of the use of MYP rather than annual contracting. BBC is similar to MYP in that it permits DOD to use a single contract for more than one year's worth of procurement of a given kind of item without having to exercise a contract option for each year after the first year. BBC is also similar to MYP in that DOD needs congressional approval for each use of BBC. BBC differs from MYP in the following ways: There is no permanent statute governing the use of BBC. There is no requirement that BBC be approved in both a DOD appropriations act and an act other than a DOD appropriations act. Programs being considered for BBC do not need to meet any legal criteria to qualify for BBC, because there is no permanent statute governing the use of BBC that establishes such criteria. A BBC contract can cover more than five years of planned procurements. Economic order quantity (EOQ) authority—the authority to bring forward selected key components of the items to be procured under the contract and purchase the components in batch form during the first year or two of the contract—does not come automatically as part of BBC authority because there is no permanent statute governing the use of BBC that includes EOQ authority as an automatic feature. BBC contracts are less likely to include cancellation penalties. Potential issues for Congress concerning MYP and BBC include whether to use MYP and BBC in the future more frequently, less frequently, or about as frequently as they are currently used; whether to create a permanent statute to govern the use of BBC, analogous to the permanent statute that governs the use of MYP; and whether the Coast Guard should begin making use of MYP and BBC."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8537}
{"pred": " The report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) examines the sustainment challenges faced by the U.S. Air Force and Navy in maintaining their fixed-wing aircraft. The report highlights that the inventory of these aircraft totaled 2,823 units, with an annual operating and support (O&S) cost of approximately $20 billion in fiscal year 2016. The report reviews the sustainment strategies, metrics, and improvement plans for 12 selected fixed-wing aircraft, including the B-52, C-17, E-8C, F-16, F-22, AV-8B, C-2A, E-2C, E-2D, EA-18G, F/A-18A-D, and F/A-18E-F. The report finds that the Air Force and Navy face similar sustainment challenges, including aging aircraft, maintenance issues, and supply support problems, which affect aircraft availability and O&S costs for the 12 aircraft selected in the review. The report also finds that the Air Force and Navy have (1) regularly reviewed sustainment metrics for fixed-wing aircraft and (2) implemented improvement plans to address aircraft availability. However, the report notes that DOD's policy and the Navy's guidance are not clear on whether legacy weapon systems, including fixed-wing aircraft, should have current sustainment strategies and whether these strategies are required to be updated every 5 years. This lack of clarity could lead to confusion among Navy program offices and other weapon system program offices across DOD, potentially jeopardizing the sustainability and affordability of each of the programs. The report concludes with two recommendations to the Department of Defense: the Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment updates or issues new policy clarifying the requirements for documenting sustainment strategies for legacy weapon systems, including fixed-wing aircraft. The Secretary of the Navy should update or issue new guidance clarifying the requirements for documenting sustainment strategies for legacy weapon systems, including fixed-wing aircraft. The report also discusses the importance of sustainment strategies in guiding operations and supporting planning and implementation activities throughout the life cycle of the aircraft. The report highlights that the Air Force and Navy have implemented improvement plans to address aircraft availability for each of the selected fixed-wing aircraft.

The Air Force and Navy are operating many of their fixed-wing aircraft well beyond their original designed service lives and therefore are confronted with sustainment challenges. House Report 114-537 included a provision for GAO to evaluate the sustainment of major weapon systems. This report, among other things, (1) examines the trends in availability and O&S costs for selected Air Force and Navy fixed-wing aircraft since fiscal year 2011, including whether they met availability goals, and (2) assesses the extent that the departments documented sustainment strategies, reviewed sustainment metrics, and implemented plans to improve aircraft availability. GAO selected a nongeneralizable sample of 12 fixed-wing aircraft by considering a variety of factors, such as the type, age, and manufacturer of the aircraft, among other factors, and analyzed condition and availability data, O&S costs, and sustainment challenges from fiscal year 2011 through March 2017 for each aircraft in a “Sustainment Quick Look.” GAO also analyzed policies, strategies, and plans, and interviewed Navy and Air Force officials in program offices, squadrons, and maintenance depots. Between fiscal years 2011 and 2016, the Air Force and Navy generally did not meet aircraft availability goals, and operating and support (O&S) cost trends for GAO's selected fixed-wing aircraft varied. Specifically, GAO found that availability declined for 6 of 12 aircraft—3 from each service—between fiscal years 2011 and 2016; availability fell short of goals for 9 of 12 aircraft in fiscal year 2016; and O&S costs increased for 5 of the aircraft, and maintenance costs—the largest share—increased for 8 of 12 aircraft. GAO found, and officials agreed, that these aircraft face similar challenges. a Obsolescence means a part is unavailable due to its lack of usefulness or it is no longer current or available for production. b Diminishing manufacturing sources is a loss or impending loss of manufacturers or suppliers. The Air Force and Navy have documented sustainment strategies for some aircraft, regularly reviewed sustainment metrics, and implemented improvement plans. The Air Force has documented sustainment strategies for all aircraft GAO reviewed; however, the Navy has not documented or updated its sustainment strategies for four aircraft. Specifically, the Navy does not have a documented sustainment strategy for the C-2A, and has not updated the strategies for the E2C, EA-18G, and F/A-18A-D since before 2012. The Navy is in the process of documenting its strategies, but Department of Defense (DOD) policy is unclear on whether a sustainment strategy is required and has to be updated every 5 years for weapon systems that are in the operations and support phase of their life cycle (i.e., legacy systems). Also, Navy guidance does not specify a requirement for legacy systems, although Air Force guidance does. Clarifying the requirements to document sustainment strategies for legacy systems, and documenting those strategies, would add additional visibility over the availability and O&S costs of DOD aircraft and any associated sustainment risks. This is a public version of a sensitive report issued in April 2018. Information on aircraft availability and other related information was deemed to be sensitive and has been omitted from this report. GAO is recommending that DOD and the Navy update or issue new policy and guidance clarifying the requirements for documenting sustainment strategies for legacy weapon systems.

It outlines the efforts of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to combat this illegal activity through law enforcement and financial incentives. The report notes that while wildlife trafficking is a major transnational crime, the exact value of the illegal trade is uncertain, with estimates ranging from $7 billion to $23 billion annually. The report also highlights the diversity of wildlife and related products involved in the illegal trade, including live reptiles, birds, mammals, and items like elephant ivory. The FWS and NOAA have implemented policies and procedures to manage financial rewards for information on wildlife trafficking, including the use of specific laws that authorize the payment of rewards. The report also discusses the challenges faced by these agencies in tracking and documenting financial rewards, as well as the need for improved communication of reward information to the public. Additionally, the report highlights the importance of reviewing the effectiveness of financial rewards in combating wildlife trafficking and making necessary adjustments to enhance their use as a law enforcement tool. The report concludes with recommendations for both agencies to improve their tracking and documentation of financial rewards, enhance their policies on reward amounts, and increase public communication about the availability of rewards for information on wildlife trafficking. These recommendations aim to strengthen the use of financial rewards as a tool in the fight against wildlife trafficking, ensuring that the agencies can effectively manage and utilize this resource to combat the illegal trade of wildlife and related products.\n\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of the given report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points. The report is about wildlife trafficking, its scale, the efforts by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to combat it, and the use of financial rewards as a tool. \n\nFirst, the report mentions that wildlife trafficking is a global issue, with estimates of the illegal trade ranging from $7 billion to $23 billion annually. This is a significant figure, and the report notes that the exact value is uncertain. The U.S. is involved in this trade, with various species being trafficked, including live reptiles, birds, mammals, and items like elephant ivory. \n\nThe FWS and NOAA have law enforcement offices that enforce laws and treaties against wildlife trafficking. These offices have budgets and employ special agents. For example, the FWS Office of Law Enforcement had a budget", "answers": ["Wildlife trafficking—the poaching and illegal trade of plants, fish, and wildlife—is a multibillion-dollar, global criminal activity that imperils thousands of species. FWS and NOAA enforce laws prohibiting wildlife trafficking that authorize the agencies to pay financial rewards for information about such illegal activities. GAO was asked to review FWS's and NOAA's use of financial rewards to combat wildlife trafficking. This report examines (1) laws that authorize FWS and NOAA to pay rewards for information on wildlife trafficking and the extent to which the agencies paid such rewards from fiscal years 2007 through 2017, (2) the agencies' reward policies, (3) information available to the public on rewards, and (4) the extent to which the agencies reviewed the effectiveness of their use of rewards. GAO reviewed laws, examined FWS and NOAA policies and public communications on rewards, analyzed agency reward data for fiscal years 2007 through 2017 and assessed their reliability, interviewed FWS and NOAA officials, and compared agency policies and public communications on rewards to federal internal control standards. Multiple laws—such as the Endangered Species Act and Lacey Act—authorize the Departments of the Interior's U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to pay rewards for information on wildlife trafficking. FWS and NOAA reported paying few rewards from fiscal years 2007 through 2017. Specifically, the agencies collectively reported paying 27 rewards, totaling $205,500. Agency officials said that the information was complete to the best of their knowledge but could not sufficiently assure that this information represented all of their reward payments. FWS and NOAA have reward policies that outline the general process for preparing reward proposals, but FWS's policy does not specify factors for its agents to consider when developing proposed reward amounts. Some FWS agents GAO interviewed said that in developing proposals, they did not know whether their proposed reward amounts were enough, too little, or too much. By augmenting its policy to specify factors for agents to consider, FWS can better ensure that its agents have the necessary quality information to prepare proposed reward amounts, consistent with federal internal control standards. FWS and NOAA communicate little information to the public on rewards. For example, most agency websites did not indicate that providing information on wildlife trafficking could qualify for a reward. This is inconsistent with federal standards that call for management to communicate quality information so that external parties can help achieve agency objectives. FWS and NOAA officials said they have not communicated general reward information because of workload concerns, but they said it may be reasonable to provide more information in some instances. By developing plans to communicate more reward information to the public, the agencies can improve their chances of obtaining information on wildlife trafficking that they otherwise might not receive. FWS and NOAA have not reviewed the effectiveness of their use of rewards. The agencies have not done so because using rewards has generally not been a priority. FWS and NOAA officials agreed that such a review would be worthwhile but provided no plans for doing so. By reviewing the effectiveness of their use of rewards, FWS and NOAA can identify opportunities to improve the usefulness of rewards as a tool for combating wildlife trafficking. GAO is making seven recommendations, including that FWS and NOAA track reward information, FWS augment its reward policy to specify factors for agents to consider when developing proposed reward amounts, FWS and NOAA develop plans to communicate more reward information to the public, and FWS and NOAA review the effectiveness of their reward use.

{"pred": " (One page, 500 words)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is about cross-border data flows and their implications for international trade, privacy, and security. It discusses the economic benefits of data flows, the challenges they pose in terms of privacy and security, and the various policy approaches being considered by different countries, including the U.S.\n\nFirst, the report emphasizes that cross-border data flows are essential for global trade and commerce. They enable online communication, track supply chains, share research, and provide cross-border services. A study estimates that digital commerce relying on data flows drives 22% of global economic output, and that global GDP will increase by another $2 trillion by 2020 due to advances in emerging technologies. However, these flows also raise concerns about data security and privacy. The report mentions that cross-border data flows are central to trade negotiations as organizations rely on transmitting information to use cloud services and send data to partners, subsidiaries, and customers.\n\nThe report also highlights the U.S. government's approach to balancing privacy, security, and open commerce. It mentions that policymakers are considering various policy options to address online privacy, which could affect cross-border data flows. For example, new consumer rights to control their personal data may impact how companies can use such data. The U.S. has aimed to eliminate trade barriers and establish enforceable international rules and best practices that allow policymakers to achieve public policy objectives, including promoting online security and privacy.\n\nThe report discusses recent incidents that have heightened public awareness of the risks of personal data stored online, such as the Cambridge Analytica scandal and data breaches affecting Google and Marriott. It also notes that data has value but comes with risks for organizations, which must protect users' privacy and not misuse the information.\n\nThe report points out that countries have varying policies and laws on these issues. The U.S. has traditionally supported open data flows and regulated privacy at a sectoral level, rather than creating a comprehensive policy. The report also mentions that some countries are developing data privacy policies that affect international trade, which could lead to trade protectionism.\n\nThe report highlights the importance of international cooperation and the development of best practices to ensure the free flow of data while protecting privacy. It mentions the role of organizations like the OECD, APEC, and the WTO in shaping these policies. The report also discusses the impact of data localization requirements and the potential for these to create trade barriers.\n\n", "answers": ["\"Cross-border data flows\" refers to the movement or transfer of information between computer servers across national borders. Such data flows enable people to transmit information for online communication, track global supply chains, share research, provide cross-border services, and support technological innovation. Ensuring open cross-border data flows has been an objective of Congress in recent trade agreements and in broader U.S. international trade policy. The free flow of personal data, however, has raised security and privacy concerns. U.S. trade policy has traditionally sought to balance the need for cross-border data flows, which often include personal data, with online privacy and security. Some stakeholders, including some Members of Congress, believe that U.S. policy should better protect personal data privacy and security, and have introduced legislation to set a national policy. Other policymakers and analysts are concerned about increasing foreign barriers to U.S. digital trade, including data flows. Recent incidents of private information being shared or exposed have heightened public awareness of the risks posed to personal data stored online. Consumers' personal online data is valued by organizations for a variety of reasons, such as analyzing marketing information and easing the efficiency of transactions. Concerns are likely to grow as the amount of online data organizations collect and the level of global data flows expand. As Congress assesses policy options, it may further explore the link between cross-border data flows, online privacy, and trade policy; the trade implications of a comprehensive data privacy policy; and the U.S. role in establishing best practices and binding trade rules that seek to balance public policy priorities. There is no globally accepted standard or definition of data privacy in the online world, and there are no comprehensive binding multilateral rules specifically about cross-border data flows and privacy. Several international organizations, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), G-20, and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, have sought to develop best practice guidelines or principles related to privacy and cross-border data flows, although none are legally binding. U.S. and other recent trade agreements are establishing new enforceable trade rules and disciplines. Countries vary in their data policies and laws; some focus on limiting access to online information by restricting the flow of data beyond a country's borders, aiming to protect domestic interests (e.g., constituents' privacy). However, these policies can also act as protectionist measures. The EU and China, two top U.S. trading partners, have established prescriptive rules on cross-border data flows and personal data from different perspectives. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is driven by privacy concerns; China is focused on security. Their policies affect U.S. firms seeking to do business in those regions, as well as in other markets that emulate the EU and Chinese approaches. Unlike the EU or China, the United States does not broadly restrict cross-border data flows and has traditionally regulated privacy at a sectoral level to cover data, such as health records. U.S. trade policy has sought to balance the goals of consumer privacy, security, and open commerce. The proposed United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) represents the Trump Administration's first attempt to include negotiated trade rules and disciplines on privacy, cross-border data flows, and security in a trade agreement. While the United States and other countries work to define their respective national privacy strategies, many stakeholders seek a more global approach that would allow interoperability between differing national regimes to facilitate and remove discriminatory trade barriers to cross-border data flows; this could offer an opportunity for the United States to lead the global conversation. Although Congress has examined issues surrounding online privacy and has considered multiple bills, there is not yet consensus on a comprehensive U.S. online data privacy policy. Congress may weigh in as the Administration seeks to define U.S. policy on data privacy and engages in international negotiations on cross-border data flows."], "all_classes": null, "length": 7088}
{"pred": " The report outlines the federal government's role in supporting airport infrastructure through three primary mechanisms: the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), Passenger Facility Charges (PFCs), and tax-exempt bonds. AIP provides federal grants for planning and development, primarily for capital projects related to aircraft operations such as runways and taxiways. PFCs are local fees on each boarding passenger, subject to federal approval, and can be used for a broader range of projects, including landside infrastructure like terminals and ground access improvements. Tax-exempt bonds allow for financing of airport improvements with interest income, subject to federal rules. The federal role in airport infrastructure began during World War II, with initial support focused on converting military airports to civilian use. Post-war, the Federal Airport Act of 1946 established federal aid, though at lower levels than during the war. In the 1960s, funding was used to upgrade runways for commercial jets. In 1970, Congress passed two laws: the Airport and Airway Development Act, which established the forerunner programs of AIP, and the Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1970, which established the Airport and Airway Trust Fund (AATF). The Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 (P.L. 97-248) created the current AIP and reactivated the trust fund. The report details the legislative history of AIP, including the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970, the Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1970, and the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982. The report also discusses the funding sources for airport development, including the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, which is primarily funded by aviation-related taxes.

Federal involvement is most consequential in AIP, PFCs, and tax-exempt financing. The AIP has been providing federal grants for airport development and planning since the passage of the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 (P.L. 97-248). AIP funding is usually spent on projects that support aircraft operations such as runways, taxiways, aprons, noise abatement, land purchase, and safety or emergency equipment. The funds obligated for AIP are drawn from the airport and airway trust fund, which is supported by a variety of user fees and fuel taxes. Different airports use different combinations of these sources depending on the individual airport's financial situation and the type of project being considered. Although smaller airports' individual grants are of much smaller dollar amounts than the grants going to large and medium hub airports, the smaller airports are much more dependent on AIP to meet their capital needs. This is particularly the case for noncommercial airports, which received over 25% of AIP grants distributed in FY2018. Larger airports are much more likely to issue tax-exempt bonds or finance capital projects with the proceeds of PFCs. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-254) provided annual AIP funding of $3.35 billion from the airport and airway trust fund for five years from FY2019 to FY2023. The act left the basic structure of AIP unchanged, but authorized supplemental annual funding of over $1 billion from the general fund to the AIP discretionary funds, starting with $1.02 billion in FY2019, and required at least 50% of the additional discretionary funds to be available to nonhub and small hub airports. The act included a provision permitting eligible projects at small airports (including those in the State Block Grant Program) to receive a 95% federal share of project costs (otherwise capped at 90%), if such projects are determined to be successive phases of a multiphase construction project that received a grant in FY2011. The 2018 reauthorization expanded the number of states that could participate in the State Block Grant Program from 10 to 20 and also expanded the existing airport privatization pilot program (now renamed the Airport Investment Partnership Program) to include more than 10 airports. The law included a provision that forbids states or local governments from levying or collecting taxes on a business at an airport that \"is not generally imposed on sales or services by that State, political subdivision, or authority unless wholly utilized for airport or aeronautical purposes.\" The airport improvement issues Congress generally faces in the context of FAA reauthorization include the following: Should airport development funding be increased or decreased? Should the $4.50 ceiling on PFCs be eliminated, raised, or kept as it is? Could AIP be restructured to address congestion at the busiest U.S. airports, or should a large share of AIP resources continue to go to noncommercial airports that lack other sources of funding? Should Congress set tighter limits on the purposes for which AIP and PFC funds may be spent?

These funds are authorized by law and are subject to congressional direction through the National Defense Authorization Act and accompanying reports. The DOD uses Form 1391 to submit project data for MILCON funding requests, which includes details on project scope, costs, and requirements. MILCON appropriations are available for obligation for 5 fiscal years, after which any unexpended funds are canceled and returned to the U.S. Treasury. The report highlights the process for developing and managing MILCON cost estimates, noting that while DOD's Unified Facilities Criteria provide some guidance, they do not fully incorporate all the steps needed for producing reliable estimates. The report also discusses the use of reprogramming to address shortfalls in specific projects, with examples of how savings from one project were used to fund another. However, the report finds that DOD's cost estimating guidance does not fully incorporate all the steps needed for producing reliable estimates, as outlined in the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide. The report concludes with a recommendation to DOD to improve its MILCON cost estimating guidance by fully incorporating all the steps needed for developing high-quality, reliable cost estimates. The report also provides detailed analysis of the active component's MILCON appropriations, obligations, and unexpended balances from fiscal years 2005 through 2016, as well as examples of reprogramming for specific projects. The findings indicate that while DOD generally obligates and expends most of its MILCON appropriations, the cost estimates for individual projects are often unreliable, leading to significant overestimates or underestimates. The report emphasizes the need for DOD to enhance its cost estimating processes to ensure reliable cost estimates, which are essential for informed decision-making regarding MILCON appropriations and project oversight.\n\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report.

Reliable project construction cost estimates are of great importance, since those estimates drive these appropriations. House Report 114-537 accompanying a proposed bill authorizing national defense activities for fiscal year 2017 included a provision for GAO to report on DOD's MILCON cost estimating. This report examines the extent to which (1) the active component obligated and expended the MILCON appropriations received during fiscal years 2005-2016, (2) the active component reprogrammed MILCON appropriations during fiscal years 2010 through 2016, and (3) DOD's MILCON cost estimates are reliable for selected projects and DOD's guidance for developing estimates fully incorporates the steps needed for developing reliable estimates. GAO analyzed the active components' MILCON execution data and reviewed DOD's guidance for cost estimating and compared it with the best practices identified in GAO's Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide . During fiscal years 2005 through 2016, Congress appropriated about $66 billion in military construction funds (MILCON) to the active duty Army, Navy, and Air Force (referred to as the active component) for projects. As of September 30, 2016, the active component had obligated all but about $5.1 billion and expended all but about $11 billion of those funds. Of the $5.1 billion remaining unobligated, about $4.6 billion was still available to be obligated because MILCON appropriations are generally available for new obligations for 5 years. According to Department of Defense (DOD) officials, available but unobligated amounts no longer needed may be either taken back by Congress or reprogrammed to other MILCON projects that the active component identifies as needing additional funding. During fiscal years 2010 through 2016, the active component reprogrammed about $1.6 billion in MILCON appropriations to fund emergency projects, projects that were authorized but did not receive specific appropriations, and projects needing additional funding. Of this amount, the Army reprogrammed about $789 million; the Navy, about $535 million; and the Air Force, about $295 million. DOD's guidance does not fully incorporate the steps needed for developing reliable estimates and the estimates for three projects that GAO reviewed were not reliable. Specifically, two of the three high-value projects GAO examined experienced a more than 30-percent increase from the initial cost estimates submitted to Congress. GAO determined that DOD cost estimators did not follow all the best practices associated with the four characteristics—comprehensive, well-documented, accurate, and credible—of a reliable estimate for these projects. GAO's Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide identifies 12 steps that, if used, are more likely to result in reliable and valid cost estimates. However, as shown below, DOD's construction guidance—the Unified Facilities Criteria—does not include all of these steps. Until DOD incorporates these steps, DOD and congressional decision-makers may not have reliable estimates to inform their decisions regarding appropriations and the oversight of projects. GAO recommends that DOD ensure that its cost estimating guidance fully incorporate the steps needed for developing reliable cost estimates. DOD partially concurred with GAO's recommendation and stated that it will issue revised cost guidance in fiscal year 2019 that more fully incorporates those steps that would benefit the military construction program."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6142}

Then it talks about the responsibilities of FSA, including ensuring schools are eligible and capable of administering federal student aid funds according to standards set by the Education Department and the Higher Education Act. These standards cover communication, personnel, policies, procedures, reporting, and internal controls.\n\nThe report also mentions that FSA is responsible for ongoing financial oversight of schools that receive federal student aid. This includes reviewing annual financial statement audits to assess a school’s financial responsibility and providing additional oversight to schools that don't meet the standards. Schools are required to submit annual compliance audits, which FSA uses to evaluate their administration of federal student aid and identify those needing more oversight. The Office of Inspector General (OIG) is responsible for assessing the quality of these audits and selects samples each year for review. The OIG checks that the audit documentation supports the auditor's opinions and that the audit results are reliable. \n\nFSA staff are supposed to refer compliance audits to the OIG for quality review if they have concerns about the audit's quality. Both FSA and OIG officials stated that the OIG has primary responsibility for issues related to audit quality. \n\nThe report then goes into detail about the certification process, including provisional certification for new schools and the recertification process. It explains that FSA uses provisional certification for initial applicants and those applying for recertification. Provisional certification is the only approval status available to new schools. Schools that are provisionally certified may face restrictions, such as not being able to open new campus locations or offering new programs without FSA approval. \n\nThe report also discusses the various sources of information that FSA uses to assess a school's capability, such as school catalogs, accreditation status, state authorization, audited financial statements, self-reported data, pre-certification reviews, school outreach, and on-site visits. \n\nThere's a section about compliance audits and program reviews. FSA relies on compliance audits as the primary annual on-site review to determine how schools administering federal student aid programs are performing. However, the report points out that the quality of these", "answers": ["Education provided over $122 billion in grants, loans and work study funds to help students pay for college at about 6,000 schools in fiscal year 2017. Education is responsible for certifying that these schools are eligible for and capable of properly administering federal student aid funds. Schools are required to submit an annual compliance audit that provides information on schools' administrative capability, which Education considers in its school certification decisions. GAO was asked to review Education's process for certifying schools to receive federal student aid. This report examines (1) how Education certifies schools to administer federal student aid and how frequently schools are approved and denied certification; and (2) the role of compliance audits in the certification process and what, if any, steps Education has taken to address the quality of the audit information. GAO analyzed data on school certification outcomes for calendar years 2006-2017 (when GAO determined data were most reliable); reviewed data and reports summarizing Education's reviews of compliance audit quality for fiscal years 2006-2017; reviewed a non-generalizable sample of 21 school certification decisions from fiscal years 2015 and 2016, selected for a mix of decisions, school characteristics, and geographic regions; examined relevant federal laws, regulations, policy manuals and guidance; and interviewed Education officials. The Department of Education (Education) is responsible for evaluating a variety of information to determine whether a postsecondary school should be certified to administer federal student aid programs, and agency data show that it approves most schools that apply. Education procedures instruct regional office staff to review school policies, financial statements, and compliance audits prepared by independent auditors, among other things. Education can certify schools to participate in federal student aid programs for up to 6 years, or it can provisionally certify them for less time if it determines that increased oversight is needed—for example, when a school applies for certification for the first time or when it has met some but not all requirements to be fully certified. In calendar years 2006 through 2017, Education fully or provisionally approved most schools applying for initial or recertification to receive federal student aid (see figure). Note: Schools applying for certification for the first time and approved are placed in provisional certification. In deciding whether to certify schools, Education particularly relies on compliance audits for direct information about how well schools are administering federal student aid, and Education's offices of Federal Student Aid and Inspector General have taken steps to address audit quality. The Inspector General annually selects a sample of compliance audits for quality reviews based on risk factors, such as auditors previously cited for errors. In fiscal years 2006 through 2017, 59 percent of the 739 selected audits received failing scores. Audits that fail must be corrected; if not, the school generally must repay federal student aid covered by the audit. Because higher risk audits are selected for review, Inspector General officials said they cannot assess the overall prevalence of quality problems in compliance audits. These two Education offices have taken steps to improve audit quality. For example, the Inspector General offered additional training to auditors on its revised 2016 audit guide and provided guidance to schools on hiring an auditor, while Federal Student Aid created a working group to strengthen its procedures for addressing poor quality compliance audits. Education's efforts to address audit quality could help ensure that these audits provide reliable information for school certification decisions.

{"pred": " The report highlights the persistent cybersecurity challenges faced by federal agencies, emphasizing the need for improved information security measures. According to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 2018 annual FISMA report, agencies reported 35,277 information security incidents to the Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) in fiscal year 2017. These incidents involved various threat vectors, such as web-based attacks, phishing attacks, and the loss or theft of computer equipment, among others. The report outlines several high-profile cybersecurity incidents, including the 2018 indictment of nine Iranians for conducting a massive cybersecurity theft campaign targeting U.S. universities, companies, and federal agencies. Additionally, a joint alert from DHS and the Federal Bureau of Investigation highlighted the targeting of U.S. government entities and critical infrastructure sectors by Russian government actors since at least March 2016. The report also discusses the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) 2015 data breach, which affected the personnel records of about 4.2 million current and former federal employees, and a separate incident that compromised background investigation files for at least 21.5 million individuals. The federal government's approach and strategy for securing information systems are outlined in laws and policies, including the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA), the Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015, and Executive Order 13800. These laws and policies establish requirements for effectively securing federal systems and information, including the use of the NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity. FISMA requires agencies to identify and provide information security protections commensurate with assessments of risk to their information and information systems. The law also assigns the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) oversight roles in ensuring federal agencies’ compliance with the law. Among other things, FISMA requires OMB to develop and oversee the implementation of policies, principles, standards, and guidelines on information security in federal agencies, except with regard to national security systems. The law also assigns OMB the responsibility of requiring agencies to identify and provide information security protections commensurate with assessments of risk to their information and information systems. The law further requires DHS to administer the implementation of agency information security policies and practices for non-national security information systems, in consultation with OMB, by developing, issuing, and overseeing implementation of binding operational directives; monitoring agency", "answers": ["Federal agencies are dependent on information systems to carry out operations. The risks to these systems are increasing as security threats evolve and become more sophisticated. To reduce the risk of a successful cyberattack, agencies can deploy intrusion detection and prevention capabilities on their networks and systems. GAO first designated federal information security as a government-wide high-risk area in 1997. In 2015, GAO expanded this area to include protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information. Most recently, in September 2018, GAO updated the area to identify 10 critical actions that the federal government and other entities need to take to address major cybersecurity challenges. The federal approach and strategy for securing information systems is grounded in the provisions of the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 and Executive Order 13800. The act requires agencies to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide program to secure their information systems. The Executive Order, issued in May 2017, directs agencies to use the National Institute of Standards and Technology's cybersecurity framework to manage cybersecurity risks. The Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015 contained a provision for GAO to report on the effectiveness of the government's approach and strategy for securing its systems. GAO determined (1) the reported effectiveness of agencies' implementation of the government's approach and strategy; (2) the extent to which DHS and OMB have taken steps to facilitate the use of intrusion detection and prevention capabilities to secure federal systems; and (3) the extent to which agencies reported implementing capabilities to detect and prevent intrusions. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed OMB reports related to agencies' information security practices including OMB's annual report to Congress for fiscal year 2017. GAO also analyzed and summarized agency-reported security performance metrics and IG-reported information for the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies. In addition, GAO evaluated plans, reports, and other documents related to DHS intrusion detection and prevention programs, and interviewed OMB, DHS, and agency officials. The 23 civilian agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO Act) have often not effectively implemented the federal government's approach and strategy for securing information systems (see figure below). Until agencies more effectively implement the government's approach and strategy, federal systems will remain at risk. To illustrate: As required by Office of Management and Budget (OMB), inspectors general (IGs) evaluated the maturity of their agencies' information security programs using performance measures associated with the five core security functions—identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. The IGs at 17 of the 23 agencies reported that their agencies' programs were not effectively implemented. IGs also evaluated information security controls as part of the annual audit of their agencies' financial statements, identifying material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal controls for financial reporting at 17 of the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies. Chief information officers (CIOs) for 17 of the 23 agencies reported not meeting all elements of the government's cybersecurity cross-agency priority goal. The goal was intended to improve cybersecurity performance through, among other things, maintaining ongoing awareness of information security, vulnerabilities, and threats; and implementing technologies and processes that reduce malware risk. Executive Order 13800 directed OMB, in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), to assess and report on the sufficiency and appropriateness of federal agencies' processes for managing cybersecurity risks. Using performance measures for each of the five core security functions, OMB determined that 13 of the 23 agencies were managing overall enterprise risks, while the other 10 agencies were at risk. In assessing agency risk by core security function, OMB identified a few agencies to be at high risk (see figure at the top of next page). DHS and OMB facilitated the use of intrusion detection and prevention capabilities to secure federal agency systems, but further efforts remain. For example, in response to prior GAO recommendations, DHS had improved the capabilities of the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS), which is intended to detect and prevent malicious traffic from entering agencies' computer networks. However, the system still had limitations, such as not having the capability to scan encrypted traffic. The department was also in the process of enhancing the capabilities of federal agencies to automate network monitoring for malicious activity through its Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program. However, the program was running behind schedule and officials at most agencies indicated the need for additional training and guidance. Further, the Federal CIO issued a mandated report assessing agencies' intrusion detection and prevention capabilities, but the report did not address required information, such as the capability of NCPS to detect advanced persistent threats, and a cost/benefit comparison of capabilities to commercial technologies and tools. Selected agencies had not consistently implemented capabilities to detect and prevent intrusions into their computer networks. Specifically, the agencies told GAO that they had not fully implemented required actions for protecting email, cloud services, host-based systems, and network traffic from malicious activity. For example, 21 of 23 agencies had not, as of September 2018, sufficiently enhanced email protection through implementation of DHS' directive on enhanced email security. In addition, less than half of the agencies that use cloud services reported monitoring these services. Further, most of the selected 23 agencies had not fully implemented the tools and services available through the first two phases of DHS's CDM program. Until agencies more thoroughly implement capabilities to detect and prevent intrusions, federal systems and the information they process will be vulnerable to malicious threats. GAO is making two recommendations to DHS, to among other things, coordinate with agencies to identify additional needs for training and guidance. GAO is also making seven recommendations to OMB to, among other things, direct the Federal CIO to update the mandated report with required information, such as detecting advanced persistent threats. DHS concurred with GAO's recommendations. OMB did not indicate whether it concurred with the recommendations or not."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12551}

The report is about USAID's assistance to the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, specifically under the ESF (Emergency Support Fund) from fiscal years 2015 and 2016. \n\nFirst, the report mentions that since 1993, USAID has obligated over $5 billion in bilateral assistance to the Palestinians. The ESF is the main funding source, and USAID provides project assistance and debt relief payments to PA creditors. The assistance is aimed at building a more democratic, stable, prosperous, and secure Palestinian society, which is in the interest of the Palestinians, the United States, and Israel.\n\nThe report details the allocation of funds, with about $544.5 million allocated for the West Bank and Gaza in fiscal years 2015 and 2016. As of March 31, 2018, they had obligated about $544.1 million (over 99%) and expended about $350.6 million (over 64%). The funds were split between direct payments to PA creditors and project assistance. \n\nThe direct payments were to two Israeli fuel companies and a Palestinian bank. These payments were for debts related to petroleum purchases and a line of credit for medical referrals to six hospitals in East Jerusalem. \n\nThe project assistance was divided into three objectives: Economic Growth and Infrastructure (about $239 million), Investing in the Next Generation (about $107 million), and Governance and Civic Engagement (about $25 million). The report also mentions that USAID conducted vetting of PA creditors to ensure they weren't associated with terrorism, following Mission Order 21. \n\nThere were some assessments of the PA ministries, like the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Finance and Planning, which found weaknesses in their systems. However, USAID took steps to mitigate these issues, such as confirming controls with the fuel companies and conducting audits. \n\nThe report also discusses the legal requirements for USAID's payments to PA creditors, noting that some requirements from prior years were not applicable to direct payments. USAID made sure to comply with the necessary procedures, including vetting creditors against the Terrorist Screening Center database. \n\nThe report concludes that USAID's compliance with legal requirements was adequate", "answers": ["Since 1993, the U.S. government has committed more than $5 billion in bilateral assistance to the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. According to the Department of State, this assistance to the Palestinians promotes U.S. economic and political foreign policy interests by supporting Middle East peace negotiations and financing economic stabilization programs. USAID is primarily responsible for administering ESF assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. Appropriations acts for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 included provisions for GAO to review the treatment, handling, and uses of funds provided through the ESF for assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. This report examines (1) the status of ESF assistance and projects provided to the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016, including project assistance and payments to PA creditors, and (2) the extent to which USAID conducted required vetting of PA creditors to ensure that this assistance would not support entities or individuals associated with terrorism and assessed PA ministries' capacity to use ESF assistance as intended. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations and USAID financial data, policies, procedures, and documents. GAO also interviewed USAID and State Department officials. As of March 2018, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) had allocated about $545 million of funding appropriated to the Economic Support Fund (ESF) for assistance in the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016. USAID obligated about $544 million (over 99 percent) and expended about $351 million (over 64 percent) of the total allocations. Project assistance accounted for approximately $399 million of the obligated funds, while payments to Palestinian Authority (PA) creditors accounted for $145 million (see figure). USAID's obligations for project assistance in the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 supported three development objectives—Economic Growth and Infrastructure ($239 million), Investing in the Next Generation ($107 million), and Governance and Civic Engagement (about $25 million). In fiscal years 2015 and 2016, USAID made payments directly to PA creditors—two Israeli fuel companies, to cover debts for petroleum purchases, and a local Palestinian bank, to pay off a line of credit used for PA medical referrals to six hospitals in the East Jerusalem Hospital network. USAID vetted PA creditors to ensure that the program assistance would not provide support to entities or individuals associated with terrorism and also conducted external assessments and financial audits of PA ministries of Health and Finance and Planning. USAID documentation showed that, as required, officials checked the vetting status of each PA creditor within 12 months before USAID signed its debt relief grant agreements with the PA. In addition, although USAID determined that it was not legally required to assess the PA Ministry of Health's medical referral services and the Ministry of Finance and Planning's petroleum procurement system, the agency commissioned external assessments of both ministries. These assessments found some weaknesses in both ministries' systems; however, USAID mission officials stated that these weaknesses did not affect USAID debt relief payments to the PA creditors. Nevertheless, USAID took additional steps to mitigate the identified weaknesses. For example, a USAID contractor worked with the Ministry of Health to update, revise, and approve guidelines for medical referrals. In addition, USAID commissioned financial audits of the debt relief grant agreements between USAID and the PA for direct payments to PA creditors in fiscal year 2015 and 2016.

{"pred": " The report discusses the importance of small business access to capital, highlighting the role small businesses have played in net job growth during previous economic recoveries, particularly in the construction, housing, and retail sectors. The report notes that small businesses have been significantly impacted by recent recessions, with the 2007-2009 recession resulting in nearly 60% of net job losses. However, small businesses have contributed to net job growth in recent years, accounting for about 63% of net new jobs from the end of the recession through FY2012, and increasing to 65% since then. The report also discusses the various legislative efforts to enhance small business access to capital, including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010. These acts provided additional resources to the Small Business Administration (SBA) to expand its lending programs and increase the availability of credit for small businesses. The report focuses on the Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF), which was established as part of the 111th Congress to address the ongoing effects of the financial crisis on small businesses by providing temporary authority to the Secretary of the Treasury to make capital investments in eligible institutions. The SBLF aimed to increase the availability of credit for small businesses by encouraging lenders, especially those experiencing liquidity problems, to increase their lending to small businesses. The report outlines the structure of the SBLF, including the eligibility criteria for participating institutions, the dividend rates, and the incentives for increasing small business lending. It also discusses the arguments both for and against the program's enactment, including concerns about the program's potential cost to the federal treasury and its similarities to the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The report also examines the implementation of the SBLF by the Department of the Treasury and the bills introduced during recent Congresses to amend the SBLF. For example, during the 112th Congress, S. 681, the Greater Accountability in the Lending Fund Act of 2011, would have required recipients to repay the funds within 10 years, terminated the program no later than 15 years after enactment, prohibited participation by any institution that received an investment under TARP, and required approval of appropriate financial regulators when determining whether an institution should receive an investment.

Some have argued that the federal government should provide additional resources to assist small businesses. Others worry about the long-term adverse economic effects of spending programs that increase the federal deficit. They advocate business tax reduction, reform of financial credit market regulation, and federal fiscal restraint as the best means to assist small businesses and create jobs. Several laws were enacted during the 111th Congress to enhance small business access to capital. For example, P.L. 111-5, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), provided the Small Business Administration (SBA) an additional $730 million, including funding to temporarily subsidize SBA fees and increase the 7(a) loan guaranty program's maximum loan guaranty percentage to 90%. P.L. 111-240, the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a $30 billion Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF), in which $4.0 billion was issued, to encourage community banks with less than $10 billion in assets to increase their lending to small businesses. It also authorized a $1.5 billion State Small Business Credit Initiative to provide funding to participating states with small business capital access programs, numerous changes to the SBA's loan guaranty and contracting programs, funding to continue the SBA's fee subsidies and the 7(a) program's 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage through December 31, 2010, and about $12 billion in tax relief for small businesses. P.L. 111-322, the Continuing Appropriations and Surface Transportation Extensions Act, 2011, authorized the SBA to continue its fee subsidies and the 7(a) program's 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage through March 4, 2011, or until available funding was exhausted, which occurred on January 3, 2011. This report focuses on the SBLF. It opens with a discussion of the supply and demand for small business loans. The SBLF's advocates claimed the SBLF was needed to enhance the supply of small business loans. The report then examines other arguments presented both for and against the program. Advocates argued that the SBLF would increase lending to small businesses and, in turn, create jobs. Opponents contended that the SBLF could lose money, lacked sufficient oversight provisions, did not require lenders to increase their lending to small businesses, could serve as a vehicle for Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients to effectively refinance their TARP loans on more favorable terms with little or no resulting benefit for small businesses, and could encourage a failing lender to make even riskier loans to avoid higher dividend payments. The report concludes with an examination of the program's implementation and a discussion of bills introduced to amend the SBLF. For example, during the 112th Congress, S. 681, the Greater Accountability in the Lending Fund Act of 2011, would have limited the program's authority to 15 years from enactment and prohibited TARP recipients from participating in the program. H.R. 2807, the Small Business Leg-Up Act of 2011, would have transferred any unobligated and repaid funds from the SBLF to the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund \"to increase the availability of credit for small businesses.\" H.R. 3147, the Small Business Lending Extension Act, would have extended the Department of the Treasury's investment authority from one year to two years.

Congress is tasked with deciding whether to approve, reject, or modify the Navy's proposed FY2020 shipbuilding program and the Navy's longer-term shipbuilding plans. These decisions can significantly affect Navy capabilities, funding requirements, and the U.S. shipbuilding industrial base.

{"pred": " The report discusses the Small Business Administration's (SBA) 7(a) loan program, which provides guaranteed loans to small businesses. The program is designed to assist businesses that cannot obtain conventional credit at reasonable terms. The SBA relies on lenders with delegated authority to make credit determinations, including the credit elsewhere requirement. This requirement ensures that the desired credit is not available from nonfederal sources. The report highlights that SBA has made efforts to improve oversight of lenders, including revising its standard operating procedures to require documentation of the credit elsewhere determination. However, the report also identifies challenges in ensuring compliance with the credit elsewhere documentation requirement, including a lack of proper internal controls and procedures among lenders. The report further discusses disparities in credit access among small businesses, particularly based on gender, minority status, and the age of the business. It notes that certain groups, such as new businesses or those owned by women, have historically faced difficulties in obtaining conventional credit. The report also examines the SBA's monitoring and evaluation of lenders' compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement, including on-site reviews, targeted reviews, and off-site reviews. The report finds that there is a high rate of noncompliance with the credit elsewhere documentation requirement, and that SBA does not require reviewers to document their assessment of lenders' policies and practices. This lack of documentation hinders SBA's ability to understand and address the root causes of noncompliance. Additionally, the report states that SBA does not routinely collect or analyze information on the criteria used for credit elsewhere justifications, which limits the agency's ability to evaluate patterns in lender practices. The report concludes with three recommendations to SBA to improve compliance with the credit elsewhere documentation requirement. These recommendations include requiring reviewers to consistently document their assessments of lenders' policies and practices, using on-site and off-site reviews to collect information on lenders' use of credit elsewhere criteria, and analyzing the collected information to identify lenders at greater risk of noncompliance. The report also discusses the SBA's recent changes to the credit elsewhere criteria, which now include both related and unrelated nonfederal sources. The report finds that lenders are struggling to interpret these new criteria, leading to inconsistencies in their application. The report also highlights the importance of the SBA's monitoring activities in ensuring that the 7(a) program serves its intended population of small businesses.

This report discusses, among other things, (1) how SBA monitors lenders' compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement, (2) the extent to which SBA evaluates trends in lender credit elsewhere practices, and (3) lenders' views on the credit elsewhere criteria for 7(a) loans. GAO analyzed SBA data on 7(a) loans approved for fiscal years 2007–2016, the latest available, and reviewed literature on small business lending; reviewed standard operating procedures, other guidance, and findings from SBA reviews performed in fiscal year 2016; and interviewed lender associations and a nonrepresentative sample of 7(a) lenders selected that concentrated on larger lenders. For its 7(a) loan program, the Small Business Administration (SBA) has largely delegated authority to lenders to make 7(a) loan determinations for those borrowers who cannot obtain conventional credit at reasonable terms elsewhere. To monitor lender compliance with the “credit elsewhere” requirement SBA primarily uses on-site reviews conducted by third-party contractors with SBA participation and oversight, and other reviews. According to SBA guidance, lenders making 7(a) loans must take steps to ensure and document that borrowers meet the program's credit elsewhere requirement. However, GAO noted a number of concerns with SBA's monitoring efforts. Specifically, GAO found the following: Over 40 percent (17 of 40) of the on-site lender reviews performed in fiscal year 2016 identified lender noncompliance with the requirement. On-site reviewers identified several factors, such as weakness in lenders' internal control processes that were the cause for lender noncompliance. Most on-site reviewers did not document their assessment of lenders' policies or procedures, because SBA does not require them to do so. As a result SBA does not have information that could help explain the high noncompliance rate. Federal internal control standards state that management should design control activities, including appropriate documentation, and use quality information to achieve the entity's objectives. Without better information on lenders' procedures for complying with the documentation requirement, SBA may be limited in its ability to promote compliance with requirements designed to help ensure that the 7(a) program reaches its target population. SBA does not routinely collect or analyze information on the criteria used by lenders for credit elsewhere justifications. SBA recently began collecting some information on lenders' use of the criteria, but this information is limited, and SBA does not analyze the information that it does collect to better understand lenders' practices. Federal internal control standards state that management should use quality information to achieve the entity's objectives. Without more robust information and analysis, SBA may be limited in its ability to understand how lenders are using the credit elsewhere criteria and identify patterns of use by certain lenders that place them at a higher risk of not reaching borrowers who cannot obtain credit from other sources at reasonable terms. In general, representatives from 8 of 11 lenders that GAO interviewed stated that SBA's credit elsewhere criteria are adequate for determining small business eligibility for the 7(a) program. These criteria help them target their lending to small businesses that would otherwise have difficulty obtaining conventional credit because they are often new businesses or have a shortage of collateral. However, they also said that other factors—such as lender policies and economic conditions—can affect their decisions to offer 7(a) loans. In January 2018, SBA issued revised guidance for the 7(a) program and has provided training on this new guidance to lenders and trade associations. Lenders told GAO they are still in the process of understanding the new requirements. GAO recommends that SBA (1) require its on-site reviewers to document their assessment of lenders' policies and procedures related to the credit elsewhere documentation requirement, (2) collect information on lenders' use of credit elsewhere criteria, and (3) analyze that information to identify trends. SBA generally agreed with the recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8215}
{"pred": " The report discusses the implementation of the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) and its subsequent modernization through the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA). Initially enacted to shift federal focus from activities to outcomes, GPRA required agencies to set long-term and annual goals, and measure progress annually. By 2004, it was noted that GPRA had laid a solid foundation for results-oriented management, with performance planning and measurement becoming more integrated into agencies' cultures. However, the report highlights that while the availability of performance information has increased, its use by managers to improve results has remained largely unchanged. In response, the report outlines a framework to better integrate performance information into decision-making processes, identifying five leading practices that promote the use of performance information for policy and program decisions. The report also highlights examples of agencies using performance information to improve results, such as the Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which increased safety belt usage from 11 percent in 1985 to 80 percent in 2004. Despite these successes, the report indicates that the use of performance information has not improved significantly at the federal level, with some agencies even experiencing a decline. The report also discusses the challenges faced by agencies in implementing GPRAMA, including the need for better data-driven decision-making practices. The report concludes with recommendations for the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to improve the use of performance information across the federal government, including the development of a comprehensive federal data strategy and the identification of proven practices to enhance the use of performance information in decision-making processes. The report emphasizes the importance of these actions in achieving greater results and improving the efficiency of federal operations. The findings suggest that while some agencies have made progress in using performance information, others continue to face challenges in doing so. The report also highlights the need for further actions to ensure that performance information is used effectively across the federal government, including the development of a comprehensive federal data strategy and the identification of proven practices to enhance the use of performance information in decision-making processes. The report concludes that these actions are essential for achieving greater results and improving the efficiency of federal operations. The report also highlights the importance of the President’s Management Agenda (PMA) and its related cross-agency priority (CAP) goals, such as the Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset CAP goal, which aims to improve the use of data in decision-making processes to increase the effectiveness of the federal government. The report concludes that these actions are", "answers": ["To reform the federal government and make it more efficient and effective, agencies need to use data about program performance. The benefit of collecting performance information is only fully realized when it is used by managers to make decisions aimed at improving results. GAO was asked to review agencies' use of performance information. This report assesses, among other things, the extent to which: (1) 24 agencies' reported use of performance information and related leading practices has changed since 2013 and (2) the Executive Branch has taken actions to enhance the use of performance information. To address the first objective, GAO analyzed results from its 2017 survey of federal managers, and compared them to 2013 results. The survey covered a stratified random sample of 4,395 managers from the 24 Chief Financial Officers Act agencies. The survey had a 67 percent response rate and results can be generalized to the population of managers government-wide and at each agency. For the second objective, GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed staff from OMB and the PIC. Agencies' reported use of performance information to make decisions, and leading practices that can promote such use, generally has not improved since GAO's last survey of federal managers in 2013. However, GAO's survey results continue to point to certain practices that could help agencies improve managers' use of performance information. For example, as shown in the table below, GAO's survey found that managers whose programs were subject to data-driven reviews (regular reviews used to assess progress on select agency goals) to a greater extent reported statistically significantly greater use of performance information to make decisions. The Executive Branch has begun taking steps to improve the use of performance information within agencies and across the government. For example, In the President's Management Agenda and government-wide reform plan, released in March and June 2018 respectively, the administration acknowledged the need to do more, and announced a goal, among other actions, to improve the use of data in federal decision making. However, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and others responsible for this goal have yet to fully develop action plans to hold agencies accountable for achieving it. The Performance Improvement Council (PIC), which is chaired by OMB, has undertaken efforts to improve the use of performance information by, for example, creating a working group on agency performance reviews. But it has not yet taken a systematic approach to identify and share proven practices that led to, or challenges that may be hampering, increased use of performance information by managers. GAO's survey results identified agencies that may have insights into such practices and challenges. More fully developing action plans for the new goal, and identifying and sharing proven practices and challenges, could help ensure the Executive Branch takes further steps to improve the use of performance information by managers within agencies and across the federal government. To improve the use of performance information within agencies and across the federal government, GAO recommends that OMB work with (1) fellow goal leaders to more fully develop action plans for the new goal to improve the use of data and (2) the PIC to prioritize efforts to identify and share proven practices and challenges.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is about how federal agencies use telework to reduce office space and improve efficiency. \n\nFirst, the Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 requires agencies to designate a Telework Managing Officer and incorporate telework into their continuity of operations plans. The Act doesn't mention telework in the context of space planning, but it does require the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to assess agencies' telework outcome goals, like real estate savings. OPM also has to submit reports on agencies' goals for increasing telework participation and help agencies develop measures and track telework eligibility and participation rates.\n\nFrom fiscal year 2012 to 2015, the percentage of federal workers eligible to telework remained stable at about 45 percent, but the percentage of eligible employees who participated in telework increased from 29 percent to 46 percent. The report mentions that agencies have used telework in space planning, with examples like the Department of Transportation setting a goal of reducing workspace by 10 percent through telework and compressed schedules.\n\nThe report also discusses the National Strategy for the Efficient Use of Real Property and the Reduce the Footprint policy, which require agencies to improve real property use, control costs, and reduce holdings. These policies also mandate the development of Five-Year Real Property Efficiency Plans annually, including office space standards and reduction targets. Agencies are to freeze their footprint, not increasing square footage of office space. The report notes that telework has changed the dynamic of the federal real property portfolio, resulting in a need for less space.\n\nGSA defines mobility as the ability of employees, enabled by IT and workplace policies, to perform work both within and outside the agency worksite. Mobility includes telework, desk-sharing, site work, and travel. Agencies can use telework combined with desk-sharing and hoteling to reduce space needs and increase efficiency, allowing them to plan for fewer workstations than the number of employees. Other strategies like smaller workstations, reconfigured office space, and mobile technology can be combined with telework to reduce office space, use space more efficiently, and potentially cut costs.\n\nThe report also outlines three scenarios for using telework in space planning, ranging from no changes to significant reductions. These scenarios are based on factors like the level of telework participation, changes to physical office spaces, and whether employees have assigned", "answers": ["Federal agencies are exploring ways to use telework as a tool to reduce the federal footprint and use space more efficiently. GAO was asked to examine the effects of telework on agencies' space-planning efforts. In this report, GAO reviewed: (1) how the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies reported using telework in office space planning; (2) the specific ways selected agencies and GSA used telework in their office space planning; and (3) any challenges the civilian CFO Act agencies faced in using telework in office space planning. GAO surveyed all 23 civilian CFO Act agencies, analyzed each agency's space-planning documents, and Real Property Efficiency Plans . GAO reviewed four agencies in greater detail based on analysis of telework data and other factors. For those four agencies GAO conducted site visits, interviewed officials, and analyzed agency documents. GAO also identified challenges agencies faced in using telework in space planning, based on survey results, agency documents, and interviews. The 23 civilian Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act agencies reported various ways of considering and using telework as a space-planning tool, by, for example, implementing desk-sharing for employees who telework in order to relinquish leased space, or increasing the number of staff working in an existing space without increasing its size. All of the 23 agencies discussed telework in the context of space planning and achieving greater space efficiencies in either their space-planning documents or Real Property Efficiency Plans . The agencies that used telework as a space-planning tool generally reported implementing smaller or unassigned workstations. Three of the four agencies GAO reviewed in greater detail––the General Services Administration (GSA); the Office of Justice Programs at the Department of Justice; the Centers for Disease Control at the Department of Health and Human Services; and the Bureau of the Fiscal Service at the Department of the Treasury––leveraged telework to reduce or use office space more efficiently. For example, GSA and the Office of Justice Programs used telework to accommodate more employees in a smaller office space as illustrated in figure 1 below. The Centers for Disease Control used telework to accommodate more employees in the same amount of space. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service reduced space without telework by reducing the size of individual workstations. The 23 civilian CFO Act agencies reported several challenges in using telework to reduce space including human capital issues, mission suitability, and measuring cost savings attributable to telework. About two-thirds of the agencies said they would find it helpful to have additional information, assistance, or resources in using telework as a space-planning tool. GSA provides guidance to improve space utilization. However, GAO found that GSA last developed relevant formal guidance in 2006. This information, and that on GSA's telework and space-planning websites, was neither specific nor detailed and therefore of limited assistance to agencies that would like to use telework as a space-planning tool. Additionally, GSA's space-planning tool—the Workplace Investment and Feasibility Tool, intended to help agencies quantify the benefits and costs of telework––remains under development after more than 4 years, and GSA officials have not decided whether to make the tool available to other federal agencies. As such, agencies reported that they lack adequate guidance to determine how best to reduce space or use it more efficiently, and how to assess the benefits and costs of using telework in space planning. GSA concurred with recommendations that GSA should: (1) develop guidance on how agencies can use telework as a strategic space-planning tool and make this guidance readily available and (2) complete and make the Workplace Investment and Feasibility Tool available to federal agencies for use in assessing the benefits and costs of telework."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6903}
{"pred": " The report highlights the growing cybersecurity threats facing federal agencies and critical infrastructure in the United States. These systems are complex, technologically diverse, and often geographically dispersed, making it difficult to identify, manage, and protect the numerous operating systems, applications, and devices comprising the systems and networks. The complexity increases the difficulty in identifying, managing, and protecting the numerous operating systems, applications, and devices comprising the systems and networks. Compounding the risk, federal systems and networks are also often interconnected with other internal and external systems and networks, including the Internet. This increases the number of avenues of attack and expands their attack surface. As systems become more integrated, cyber threats will pose an increasing risk to national security, economic well-being, and public health and safety. Advancements in technology, such as data analytics software for searching and collecting information, have also made it easier for individuals and organizations to correlate data (including PII) and track it across large and numerous databases. For example, social media has been used as a mass communication tool where PII can be gathered in vast amounts. In addition, ubiquitous Internet and cellular connectivity makes it easier to track individuals by allowing easy access to information pinpointing their locations. These advances—combined with the increasing sophistication of hackers and others with malicious intent, and the extent to which both federal agencies and private companies collect sensitive information about individuals—have increased the risk of PII being exposed and compromised. Cybersecurity incidents continue to impact entities across various critical infrastructure sectors. For example, in its 2018 annual data breach investigations report, Verizon reported that 53,308 security incidents and 2,216 data breaches were identified across 65 countries in the 12 months since its prior report. Further, the report noted that cybercriminals can often compromise a system in just a matter of minutes—or even seconds, but that it can take an organization significantly longer to discover the breach. Specifically, the report stated nearly 90 percent of the reported breaches occurred within minutes, while nearly 70 percent went undiscovered for months. These concerns are further highlighted by the number of information security incidents reported by federal executive branch civilian agencies to DHS’s U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT). For fiscal year 2017, 35,277 such incidents were reported by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in its 2018 annual report to Congress, as mandated by the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (F", "answers": ["Federal agencies and the nation's critical infrastructures—such as energy, transportation systems, communications, and financial services—are dependent on information technology systems to carry out operations. The security of these systems and the data they use is vital to public confidence and national security, prosperity, and well-being. The risks to these systems are increasing as security threats evolve and become more sophisticated. GAO first designated information security as a government-wide high-risk area in 1997. This was expanded to include protecting cyber critical infrastructure in 2003 and protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information in 2015. This report provides an update to the information security high-risk area. To do so, GAO identified the actions the federal government and other entities need to take to address cybersecurity challenges. GAO primarily reviewed prior work issued since the start of fiscal year 2016 related to privacy, critical federal functions, and cybersecurity incidents, among other areas. GAO also reviewed recent cybersecurity policy and strategy documents, as well as information security industry reports of recent cyberattacks and security breaches. GAO has identified four major cybersecurity challenges and 10 critical actions that the federal government and other entities need to take to address them. GAO continues to designate information security as a government-wide high-risk area due to increasing cyber-based threats and the persistent nature of security vulnerabilities. GAO has made over 3,000 recommendations to agencies aimed at addressing cybersecurity shortcomings in each of these action areas, including protecting cyber critical infrastructure, managing the cybersecurity workforce, and responding to cybersecurity incidents. Although many recommendations have been addressed, about 1,000 have not yet been implemented.

{"pred": " The report discusses the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Office of Policy and Strategy (PLCY) and its challenges in leading and coordinating departmentwide and crosscutting policies. Following the passage of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) in December 2016, PLCY was elevated to an Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans, who is appointed by the President with Senate confirmation. However, as of June 2018, the position remained vacant, and the Secretary had not nominated a candidate. The NDAA also authorized, but did not require, the Secretary to establish a Deputy Under Secretary position within PLCY, which could be filled by a career employee. In March 2018, the Secretary named a Deputy Under Secretary, who has been performing the duties of the Deputy Under Secretary and the Under Secretary since then. PLCY is divided into five sub-offices, each with a different focus area. As of June 2018, the top position in these sub-offices was an assistant secretary and two of the five positions were vacant. Additionally, 6 of PLCY’s 12 deputy assistant secretary positions were vacant or filled by acting staff temporarily performing the duties in the absence of permanent staff placement. The NDAA codified many of the functions and responsibilities that PLCY had been carrying out prior to the act’s enactment, with a few exceptions. According to the act and PLCY officials, one of the office’s fundamental responsibilities is to lead, conduct, and coordinate departmentwide policy development and implementation, and strategic planning. PLCY leads four categories of policy and strategy efforts: statutory responsibilities, interagency efforts, Secretary’s priorities, and self-initiated activities. The report highlights that PLCY's ability to lead and coordinate policy has been limited due to ambiguous roles and responsibilities, and a lack of predictable, accountable, and repeatable procedures. The report also discusses the challenges in workforce planning, as PLCY does not systematically apply the principles of the DHS Workforce Planning Guide to identify workforce demand, capacity gaps, and strategies to address them. The report concludes with four recommendations for DHS to improve PLCY's effectiveness, including finalizing a delegation of authority document, establishing processes and procedures, using the workforce planning guide, and enhancing collaboration and communication mechanisms. The report also mentions that DHS provided comments, with some concurrence on the recommendations.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the", "answers": ["GAO has designated DHS management as high risk because of challenges in building a cohesive department. PLCY supports cohesiveness by, among other things, coordinating departmentwide policy and strategy. In the past, however, questions have been raised about PLCY's efficacy. In December 2016, the NDAA codified PLCY's organizational structure, roles, and responsibilities. GAO was asked to evaluate PLCY's effectiveness. This report addresses the extent to which (1) DHS established an organizational structure and processes and procedures that position PLCY to be effective, (2) DHS and PLCY have ensured alignment of workforce with priorities, and (3) PLCY has engaged relevant component staff to help identify and respond to emerging needs. GAO analyzed the NDAA, documents describing specific responsibilities, and departmentwide policies and strategies. GAO also interviewed officials in PLCY and all eight operational components. According to our analysis and interviews with operational components, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans' (PLCY) organizational structure and efforts to lead and coordinate departmentwide and crosscutting strategies—a key organizational objective–have been effective. For example, PLCY's coordination efforts for a strategy and policy executive steering committee have been successful, particularly for strategies. However, PLCY has encountered challenges leading and coordinating efforts to develop, update, or harmonize policies that affect multiple DHS components. In large part, these challenges are because DHS does not have clearly-defined roles and responsibilities with accompanying processes and procedures to help PLCY lead and coordinate policy in a predictable, repeatable, and accountable manner. Until PLCY's roles and responsibilities for policy are more clearly defined and corresponding processes and procedures are in place, situations where the lack of clarity hampers PLCY's effectiveness in driving policy are likely to continue. Development of a delegation of authority, which involves reaching agreement about PLCY's roles and responsibilities and clearly documenting them, had been underway. However, it stalled due to changes in department leadership. As of May 2018, the effort had been revived, but it is not clear whether and when DHS will finalize it. PLCY does some workforce planning as part of its annual budgeting process, but does not systematically apply key principles of the DHS Workforce Planning Guide to help ensure that PLCY's workforce aligns with its and DHS's priorities and goals. According to PLCY officials, the nature of its mission requires a flexible staffing approach. As such, a portion of the staff functions as generalists who can be assigned to meet the needs of different situations, including unexpected changing priorities due to an emerging need. However, shifting short-term priorities requires tradeoffs, which may divert attention and resources from longer-term priorities. As of June 5, 2018, PLCY also had a number of vacancies in key leadership positions, which further limited attention to certain priorities. According to PLCY officials, PLCY recently began a review to identify the office's authorities in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (NDAA) and other statutes, compare these authorities to the current organization and operations, and address any workforce capacity gaps. Employing workforce planning principles—in particular, systematic identification of workforce demand, capacity gaps, and strategies to address them—consistent with the DHS Workforce Planning Guide could better position PLCY to use its workforce as effectively as possible under uncertain conditions and to communicate effectively with DHS leadership about tradeoffs. Officials from PLCY and DHS operational components praised existing mechanisms to coordinate and communicate at the senior level, especially about strategy, but component officials identified opportunities to better connect PLCY and component staff to improve communication flow about emerging policy and strategy needs. Among the ideas offered by component officials to enhance communication and collaboration were holding routine small-group meetings, creating forums for periodic knowledge sharing, and maintaining accurate and up-to-date contact information for all staff-level stakeholders. GAO is making four recommendations. DHS concurred with three recommendations, including that DHS finalize a delegation of authority defining PLCY's roles and responsibilities and develop corresponding processes and procedures.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this detailed report about the Stafford Act and FEMA's disaster assistance process. Let me start by understanding the key points from the report.\n\nFirst, the report explains the Stafford Act, which allows states and tribes to request a presidential disaster declaration. FEMA coordinates the federal response and provides assistance through various programs like IA, Public Assistance, and Hazard Mitigation. The IA program includes five different assistance programs for disaster victims.\n\nThen there are the six factors FEMA considers when evaluating IA requests. These factors are concentration of damages, trauma, special populations, voluntary agency assistance, insurance coverage, and average individual assistance by state. The report mentions that FEMA regions use these factors to determine if a disaster declaration is warranted, but there's inconsistency in documenting all elements of these factors across regions.\n\nThe report also discusses the data from 2008 to 2016, showing that 57% of IA requests were declared, with total obligations around $8.6 billion. Some regions had higher denial rates, and others had lower. The report highlights that FEMA regions didn't consistently document all elements of the six factors in their RVARs, which are used to recommend to the President. This lack of documentation could affect the consistency and transparency of the process.\n\nThere are challenges mentioned, such as the subjective nature of the IA factors, lack of eligibility thresholds, and difficulty in gathering information on these factors. FEMA regions sometimes omit elements due to the complexity of the factors or because they are not used consistently. The report also mentions that FEMA is considering revising the six factors to make them more objective, but the timeline for this is uncertain.\n\nThe report concludes with recommendations for FEMA to evaluate why regions aren't completing the RVARs for all elements of the IA factors and take corrective steps if needed. It also mentions that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has agreed to this recommendation and plans to implement actions by the fall of 2018.\n\nNow, I need to condense all this into a one-page summary. I should start by outlining the main components: the Stafford Act, FEMA's role, the IA programs, the six regulatory factors, the data from 2008-2016, the challenges in the process, and the proposed revisions and recommendations.\n\nI need to make sure the summary is concise, covers all the key points, and is structured logically.

When a state, U.S. territory, or tribe requests IA assistance through a federal disaster declaration, FEMA evaluates the request against regulatory factors, such as concentration of damages, and provides a recommendation to the President, who makes a final declaration decision. GAO was asked to review FEMA's IA declaration process. This report examines (1) the number of IA declaration requests received, declared, and denied, and IA actual obligations from calendar years 2008 through 2016, (2) the extent to which FEMA accounts for the regulatory factors when evaluating IA requests, and (3) any challenges FEMA regions and select states reported on the declaration process and factors and any FEMA actions to revise them. GAO reviewed FEMA's policies, IA declaration requests and obligation data, and FEMA's RVARs from July 2012 through December 2016, the most recent years for which data were available. GAO also reviewed proposed rulemaking comments and interviewed FEMA officials from all 10 regions and 11 state emergency management offices selected based on declaration requests and other factors. From calendar years 2008 through 2016, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Federal Emergency and Management Agency (FEMA) received 294 Individual Assistance (IA) declaration requests from states, U.S. territories, and tribes to help individuals meet their immediate needs after a disaster. Of these, the President declared 168 and denied 126 requests. Across the various types of IA declaration requests, severe storms (190) were the most common disaster type and drought (1) was among the least common. FEMA obligated about $8.6 billion in IA for disaster declarations during this period. GAO found that FEMA regions did not consistently obtain and document information on all elements of established IA regulatory factors when making IA recommendations to headquarters. Following a declaration request, a FEMA region is to prepare a Regional Administrator's Validation and Recommendation (RVAR)—a document designed to include data on each of the six IA regulatory factors for each declaration request as well as the regional administrator's recommendation. GAO reviewed all 81 RVARs from July 2012—the date FEMA began using the new RVAR template—through December 2016. GAO found that regions did not consistently obtain and document information for the elements required under the six regulatory factors (see table). For example, only 44 of the 81 RVARs documented all elements under the concentration of damage factor. By evaluating why regions are not completing all elements of each current IA regulatory factor, FEMA could identify whether any corrective steps are needed. Officials from the 10 FEMA regions and 11 states GAO interviewed, reported positive relationships with each other, but also cited various challenges with the IA declaration process and regulatory factors. For example, these officials told GAO that there are no established minimum thresholds for IA, making final determinations more subjective and the rationale behind denials unclear. However, as required by the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, FEMA has taken steps to revise the IA factors by issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking. According to FEMA, the proposed rule aims to provide more objective criteria, clarify the threshold for eligibility, and speed up the IA declaration process. As of April 2018, the proposed rule was still under consideration. According to FEMA officials, they plan to finalize the rule in late 2018; therefore, it is too early to know the extent to which it will address these challenges. GAO recommends that FEMA evaluate why regions are not completing the RVARs for each element of the current IA regulatory factors and take corrective steps, if necessary.

{"pred": " The U.S. Forest Service, responsible for managing national forests and grasslands, conducting research, and providing outdoor recreation, faces significant internal control deficiencies. The agency's budgetary processes, including allotments, administrative control of funds, and fund transfers, lack adequate control activities to ensure that appropriated funds are used for their designated purposes. For example, the Forest Service failed to allocate $65 million from fiscal year 2015 for acquiring aircraft for the next-generation airtanker fleet, using the funds for other purposes. Similarly, in fiscal year 2016, the Forest Service did not create new budget line items for the Forest Inventory and Analysis Program, leading to difficulties in tracking related expenditures. These issues increase the risk of violating the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits the use of funds for unauthorized purposes. Additionally, the Forest Service did not have a process to review unobligated no-year funds from prior years for continuing need, which could lead to inefficient use of funds and missed opportunities for reallocation. The agency also lacks a comprehensive system for administrative control of funds, as required by USDA and OMB policies. The Forest Service's processes for reviewing unliquidated obligations were not properly designed, leading to an increased risk of not achieving control objectives related to optimum utilization of funds and timely adjustments of obligated balances. The agency's manuals and handbooks, which provide directives for its operations, were not adequately reviewed or updated to reflect current processes and systems, increasing the risk of inconsistent and ineffective performance. The Forest Service also lacks proper segregation of duties for reimbursable agreements and adjustments affecting the final disposition of related receivables, increasing the risk of fraud and mismanagement. The report highlights 11 recommendations to improve internal controls, including revising processes for allotments, developing processes for reviewing unobligated no-year funds, creating a comprehensive system for administrative control of funds, and ensuring segregation of duties for reimbursable agreements. The Forest Service has made progress in addressing these issues, but further action is needed to ensure the effective management of its budgetary resources and compliance with laws and regulations.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report about the U.S. Forest Service. Let me start by understanding the key points the report is making. \n\nFirst, the report outlines the Forest Service's mission, which includes managing public lands, conducting research, and providing outdoor recreation. It mentions the three main program areas: managing public lands (National Forest System), conducting research, and working with state and", "answers": ["The Forest Service, an agency within USDA, performs a variety of tasks as steward of 193 million acres of public forests and grasslands. Its budget execution process for carrying out its mission includes (1) allotments, which are authorizations by an agency to incur obligations within a specified amount, and (2) unliquidated obligations, which represent budgetary resources that have been committed but not yet paid. Deobligation refers to an agency's cancellation or downward adjustments of previously incurred obligations, which may result in funds that may be available for reobligation. GAO was asked to review the Forest Service's internal controls over its budget execution processes. This report examines the extent to which the Forest Service properly designed control activities over (1) allotments of budgetary resources, its system for administrative control of funds, and any fund transfers between Forest Service appropriations; (2) reimbursables and related collections; and (3) review and certification of unliquidated obligations. GAO reviewed the Forest Service's policies, procedures, and other documentation and interviewed agency officials. In fiscal years 2015 and 2016, the Forest Service received discretionary no-year appropriations of $5.1 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively. It is critical for the Forest Service to manage its budgetary resources efficiently and effectively. While the Forest Service had processes over certain of its budget execution activities, GAO found the following internal control deficiencies: Budgetary resources . The purpose statute requires that amounts designated in appropriations acts for specific purposes are used as designated. The Forest Service did not have an adequate process and related control activities to reasonably assure that amounts were used as designated. In fiscal year 2017, GAO issued a legal opinion that the Forest Service had failed to comply with the purpose statute with regard to a $65 million line-item appropriation specifically provided for the purpose of acquiring aircraft for the next-generation airtanker fleet. Further, the Forest Service lacked a process and related control activities to reasonably assure that unobligated no-year appropriation balances from prior years were reviewed for their continuing need; did not have a properly designed system for administrative control of funds, which keeps obligations and expenditures from exceeding limits authorized by law; and had not properly designed control activities for fund transfers to its Wildland Fire Management program. These deficiencies increase the risk that the Forest Service may make budget requests in excess of its needs. Reimbursable agreements . To carry out its mission, the Forest Service enters into reimbursable agreements with agencies within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), other federal agencies, state and local government agencies, and nongovernment entities. The Forest Service (1) did not have adequately described processes and related control activities in manuals and handbooks for its reimbursable agreement processes and (2) lacked control activities related to segregating incompatible duties performed by line officers and program managers. For example, line officers may be responsible for initiating cost sharing agreements, modifying cost settlement packages, and changing or canceling the related receivable, which represent incompatible duties. As a result, programs and resources may not be protected from waste, fraud, and mismanagement. Unliquidated obligations . The Forest Service's processes and control activities over the review and certification of unliquidated obligations were not properly designed to reasonably assure the best use of funds and that unliquidated obligations would be efficiently and effectively deobligated and made available for other program needs. Further, the current process, as designed, was inconsistent with USDA and Forest Service policy. In addition, the Forest Service's manuals and handbooks, which provide directives for the areas that GAO reviewed, had not been reviewed by management in accordance with the Forest Service's 5-year review policy. Further, standard operating procedures and desk guides prepared by staff to supplement the manuals and handbooks were not issued as directives and therefore were not considered official policy. This increases the risk that control activities may not be consistently performed across the agency. GAO is making 11 recommendations to improve processes and related internal control activities over the management of the Forest Service's budgetary resources, reimbursable receivables and collections, and its process for reviewing unliquidated obligations. The Forest Service generally agreed with the report and stated that it has made significant progress to address the report findings."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8760}

It then outlines the purposes of the confirmation process, such as examining qualifications, influencing policy, and delaying for leverage. The report mentions that most nominations are routine, especially military and civilian appointments, with many being confirmed quickly. However, some high-level positions, like federal judges, undergo more scrutiny. The Senate has mechanisms to handle the volume of nominations, including en bloc approvals and committee referrals. There's also mention of the role of senatorial courtesy in certain appointments. The report discusses the process from the President's nomination message to the Senate's consideration, including committee investigations, hearings, and the potential for cloture motions. It also touches on the use of holds by Senators to delay or block nominations, and the recent changes to the cloture rules that have affected the confirmation process.

Committees play the central role in the process through investigations and hearings. Senate Rule XXXI provides that nominations shall be referred to appropriate committees \"unless otherwise ordered.\" Most nominations are referred, although a Senate standing order provides that some \"privileged\" nominations to specified positions will not be referred unless requested by a Senator. The Senate rule concerning committee jurisdictions (Rule XXV) broadly defines issue areas for committees, and the same jurisdictional statements generally apply to nominations as well as legislation. A committee often gathers information about a nominee either before or instead of a formal hearing. A committee considering a nomination has four options. It can report the nomination to the Senate favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation, or it can choose to take no action. It is more common for a committee to take no action on a nomination than to reject a nominee outright. The Senate handles executive business, which includes both nominations and treaties, separately from its legislative business. All nominations reported from committee are listed on the Executive Calendar, a separate document from the Calendar of Business, which lists pending bills and resolutions. Generally speaking, the majority leader schedules floor consideration of nominations on the Calendar. Nominations are considered in \"executive session,\" a parliamentary form of the Senate in session that has its own journal and, to some extent, its own rules of procedure. The Senate can call up a nomination expeditiously, because a motion to enter executive session to consider a specific nomination on the Calendar is not debatable. This motion requires a majority of Senators present and voting, a quorum being present, for approval. After a nomination has been called up, the question before the Senate is \"will the Senate advise and consent to this nomination?\" A majority of Senators voting is required to approve a nomination. However, Senate rules place no limit on how long a nomination may be debated, and ending consideration could require invoking cloture. On April 6, 2017, the Senate reinterpreted Rule XXII in order to allow cloture to be invoked on nominations to the Supreme Court by a majority of Senators voting. This expanded the results of similar actions taken by the Senate in November 2013, which changed the cloture vote requirement to a majority for nominations other than to the Supreme Court. After the 2013 decision, the number of nominations subjected to a cloture process increased. On April 3, 2019, the Senate reinterpreted Rule XXII again. The Senate reduced, from 30 hours to 2 hours, the maximum time nominations can be considered after cloture has been invoked. This change applied to all executive branch nominations except to high-level positions such as heads of departments, and it applied to all judicial nominations except to the Supreme Court and the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The full impact of this change is difficult to assess at this time, but it is likely to shorten the time between a cloture vote and a vote on the nomination. If Senators respond as they did to the last reinterpretation of the cloture rule, it might also increase the number of nominations subjected to a cloture process. Nominations that are pending when the Senate adjourns sine die at the end of a session or recesses for more than 30 days are returned to the President unless the Senate, by unanimous consent, waives the rule requiring their return (Senate Rule XXXI, clause 6).

It also directs the reader to other reports providing context for specific component appropriations. As part of an overall DHS budget that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimated to be $74.88 billion, the Trump Administration requested $47.43 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority through the appropriations process for DHS for FY2018. The request amounted to a $0.29 billion (0.6%) decrease from the $47.72 billion in annual appropriations enacted for FY2018 through the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141, Division F). The Administration also requested discretionary funding for DHS components that does not count against discretionary spending limits and is not reflected in the adjusted net discretionary budget authority total. The Administration requested an additional $6.65 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in disaster relief funding, as defined by the Budget Control Act (P.L. 112-25; BCA), and in the budget request for the Department of Defense (DOD), $165 million in Overseas Contingency Operations designated funding (OCO) from the Operations and Maintenance budget of the U.S. Navy.

{"pred": " The report examines the legal and constitutional aspects of \"affirmative action\" in higher education, focusing on two distinct interpretations: (1) the mandatory use of race-conscious measures to dismantle the remnants of de jure segregation in public universities, and (2) the voluntary consideration of race in admissions decisions to promote racial diversity, a practice upheld by the Supreme Court under strict scrutiny. The report begins by discussing the historical context of de jure segregation in higher education, which was prevalent in the United States until the mid-20th century. The Supreme Court's 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education declared that racial segregation in public education violated the Equal Protection Clause, and this ruling was extended to higher education in subsequent cases. The report then delves into the 1992 case United States v. Fordice, where the Court outlined a three-step analysis to determine whether a state had fulfilled its constitutional obligation to eliminate vestiges of de jure segregation. The first step involves determining whether a current policy is traceable to the de jure system, the second step assesses whether the policy has continued discriminatory effects, and the third step evaluates whether the policy can be practicably eliminated consistent with sound educational policy. The report also discusses the role of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in ensuring equal protection in higher education, both public and private, and the potential for congressional action under the Act. The report highlights the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Fordice, which established that a state must eliminate all vestiges of its de jure segregated public university system, including through race-conscious measures, to satisfy its constitutional obligation under the Equal Protection Clause. The report also discusses the legal implications of voluntary affirmative action policies, particularly in the context of race-conscious admissions decisions, and the Court's application of strict scrutiny to these policies. The report concludes by emphasizing the role of Title VI in ensuring equal protection in higher education, both public and private, and the potential for congressional action under the Act. The report also highlights the ongoing legal debates and unresolved questions regarding the permissible applications of the Fordice standard to various fact patterns and legal theories, as well as the potential for future developments in the interpretation of these standards. The report underscores the importance of the two lines of authority discussed in this report, and the potential for further developments in the interpretation of these standards, as well as the role of Congress in shaping the substantive scope of Title VI and its enforcement.\nOkay, I need to write", "answers": ["When federal courts have analyzed and addressed \"affirmative action\" in higher education, they have done so in two distinct but related senses, both under the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of \"equal protection.\" The first has its roots in the original sense of \"affirmative action:\" the mandatory use of race by public education systems to eliminate the remnants of state-imposed racial segregation. Because state-sanctioned race segregation in public education violates the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, in certain cases involving a state's formerly de jure segregated public university system, a state's consideration of race in its higher education policies and practices may be an affirmative obligation. As the U.S. Supreme Court explained in its consequential 1992 decision United States v. Fordice, equal protection may require states that formerly maintained de jure segregated university systems to consider race for the purpose of eliminating all vestiges of their prior \"dual\" systems. Drawing upon its precedent addressing racially segregated public schools in the K-12 context, the Court established a three-part legal standard in Fordice for evaluating the sufficiency and effectiveness of a state's efforts in \"dismantl[ing]\" its formerly de jure segregated public university system. To that remedial end, mandatory race-conscious measures—in this de jure context—are not limited to admissions. Instead, remedies may also address policies and practices relating to academic programs, institutional missions, funding, and other aspects of public university operations. Outside this de jure context, \"affirmative action\" has come to refer to a different category of race-conscious policies. These involve what the Court at one time called the \"benign\" use of racial classifications—voluntary measures designed not to remedy past de jure discrimination, but to help racial minorities overcome the effects of their earlier exclusion. And for institutions of higher education, the Court has addressed one type of affirmative action policy in particular: the use of race as a factor in admissions decisions, a practice now widely observed by both public and private colleges and universities. The federal courts have come to subject these voluntary race-conscious policies—\"affirmative action\" in its perhaps more familiar sense—to a particularly searching form of review known as strict scrutiny. And even though this heightened judicial scrutiny has long been regarded as strict in theory but fatal in fact, the Court's review of race-conscious admissions policies in higher education has proved a notable exception, with the Court having twice upheld universities' use of race as one of many factors considered when assembling their incoming classes. The Court has long grappled with this seeming tension—between the strictness of its scrutiny and its approval of race-conscious admissions policies—beginning with its landmark 1978 decision in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke through its 2016 decision in Fisher v. University of Texas. Though the Equal Protection Clause generally concerns public universities and their constitutional obligations under the Fourteenth Amendment, federal statutory law also plays a role in ensuring equal protection in higher education. To that end, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits recipients of federal funding—including private colleges and universities—from, at a minimum, discriminating against students and applicants in a manner that would violate the Equal Protection Clause. Federal agencies, including the Departments of Justice and Education, investigate and administratively enforce institutions' compliance with Title VI."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12474}

The report also highlights the challenges states have faced in implementing these services, including difficulties in identifying potentially eligible students, coordinating with state educational agencies, and managing the financial aspects of the program. The report notes that while most state VR agencies have expanded their services for students with disabilities since WIOA's enactment, many have not used all the funds reserved for pre-employment transition services. Additionally, many state VR agencies have not updated their interagency agreements with state educational agencies to include pre-employment transition services. The report also discusses the need for additional guidance and technical assistance to help state VR agencies implement these services effectively. The report concludes with three recommendations for the Department of Education to improve the implementation of pre-employment transition services for students with disabilities.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report. Let me start by understanding the main points. The report is about the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by WIOA, which funds programs to help people with disabilities get employment. The key program mentioned is the State Vocational Rehabilitation Services, which helps individuals with disabilities prepare for and obtain employment. \n\nThe report talks about the changes made by WIOA, which requires state VR agencies to provide pre-employment transition services to students with disabilities. These services are supposed to help students transition from school to work or further education. The services include things like work-based learning, self-advocacy training, and other activities. \n\nThe report also discusses the challenges states have faced in implementing these services. For example, some states have had trouble identifying all potentially eligible students. There's also a mention of agencies for the blind having fewer resources to serve a larger population. Additionally, there are issues with the funds reserved for these services not being fully utilized, which affects the ability to balance other VR services for adults. \n\nThe report mentions that while most state VR agencies have expanded their services for students with disabilities since WIOA's enactment, many have not used all the funds reserved for pre-employment transition services. This is a problem because the funds are supposed to be used for specific activities, and not using them could lead to missed opportunities for students who might be eligible.", "answers": ["WIOA requires states to reserve at least 15 percent of their total State Vocational Rehabilitation Services program funds to provide pre-employment transition services to help students with disabilities transition from school to work.

GAO reviewed documents and funding data from Education, and federal laws and regulations; surveyed all 79 state VR agencies (74 responded); held discussion groups with representatives of 29 state VR agencies; and interviewed officials from Education and three states (Idaho, Illinois, and Maryland) GAO selected for variety in size and type of agencies, among other factors. Of the 74 state vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies that responded to GAO's survey, most reported expanding services to help students with disabilities transition from school to work as required under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), enacted in July 2014. Most state agencies reported serving more students and providing work-based learning experiences and other activities, referred to as pre-employment transition services (see figure). State VR agencies reported two key challenges with implementing pre-employment transition services for students as required by WIOA. Spending reserved funds : States reported spending about $357 million out of the $465 million reserved for these services in fiscal year 2016. Education officials said that states had difficulty determining what expenditures were allowable, and some state officials said they would like more detailed information from Education. Education officials said they plan to clarify guidance but have no timeframe for providing further information, which would help states to better plan their use of reserved funds. Finalizing interagency agreements : Fewer than half the state VR agencies that responded to GAO's survey (34 of 74) reported updating their interagency agreement with their state's educational agency. Interagency agreements can help promote collaboration by, for example, establishing roles and responsibilities of each agency. Although Education offers technical assistance on interagency agreements, without increased efforts to raise awareness about the importance of these agreements and provide assistance to states where needed, Education may miss opportunities to help state VR and educational agencies efficiently and effectively coordinate services. In addition, WIOA requires Education to highlight best state practices, and most VR agencies responding to GAO's survey (63 of 74) reported this would be useful. Education does not have a written plan or timeframe for identifying and disseminating best practices. As a result, Education may miss opportunities to help more students with disabilities successfully transition from school to work. GAO is recommending that Education (1) establish timeframes for providing additional information on allowable expenditures, (2) take additional steps to assist states that have not updated and finalized their interagency agreements, and (3) develop a written plan with specific timeframes and activities for identifying and disseminating best practices. Education agreed with the first recommendation and disagreed with the other two.

{"pred": " Medicare is a federal health insurance program established in 1965 under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act. It provides coverage for individuals aged 65 and older, as well as those with permanent disabilities under 65. The program is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Medicare consists of four parts: Part A covers inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing care, hospice care, and some home health services. Part B covers physician services, outpatient services, and some home health and preventive services. Part C, Medicare Advantage, is a private plan option that covers all Parts A and B services, except hospice. Part D covers outpatient prescription drug benefits. Funding for Medicare comes from a combination of payroll taxes, beneficiary premiums, general revenues, and state transfers. The program is divided into two trust funds: the Hospital Insurance (HI) trust fund for Part A and the Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) trust fund for Parts B and D. Medicare serves approximately one in six Americans, with 61 million beneficiaries in 2019. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that total Medicare spending in 2019 will be about $772 billion; of this amount, approximately $749 billion will be spent on benefits. About 28% of Medicare benefit spending is for hospital inpatient and hospital outpatient services. Medicare is considered a mandatory spending program, not subject to the appropriations process. The program has significant financial implications for the federal budget and for beneficiaries, with projections indicating increasing demands on the program. Medicare is expected to be a high-priority issue in the current Congress. The program has a significant impact on beneficiaries and other stakeholders, as well as on the economy, through its coverage of important health care benefits for the aged and disabled, the payment of premiums and other cost sharing by those beneficiaries, its payments to providers who supply those health care services, and its interaction with other insurance coverage. Projections of future Medicare expenditures and funding indicate that the program will place increasing financial demands on the federal budget and on beneficiaries. In response to these concerns, Congress may consider a range of Medicare reform options, from making changes within the current structure, including modifying provider payments and revising existing oversight and regulatory mechanisms, to restructuring the entire program. The committees of jurisdiction for the mandatory spending (benefits) portion of Medicare are the Senate Committee on Finance, the House Committee on Ways and Means", "answers": ["Medicare is a federal program that pays for covered health care services of qualified beneficiaries. It was established in 1965 under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide health insurance to individuals 65 and older, and has been expanded over the years to include permanently disabled individuals under the age of 65. Medicare, which consists of four parts (A-D), covers hospitalizations, physician services, prescription drugs, skilled nursing facility care, home health visits, and hospice care, among other services. Generally, individuals are eligible for Medicare if they or their spouse worked for at least 40 quarters in Medicare-covered employment, are 65 years old, and are a citizen or permanent resident of the United States. Individuals may also qualify for coverage if they are a younger person who cannot work because they have a medical condition that is expected to last at least one year or result in death, or have end-stage renal disease (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplant). The program is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and by private entities that contract with CMS to provide claims processing, auditing, and quality oversight services. In FY2019, the program is expected to cover approximately 61 million persons (52 million aged and 9 million disabled) at a total cost of about $772 billion. Spending under the program (except for a portion of administrative costs) is considered mandatory spending and is not subject to the annual appropriations process. Services provided under Parts A and B (also referred to as \"original\" or \"traditional\" Medicare) are generally paid directly by the government on a \"fee-for-service\" basis, using different prospective payment systems or fee schedules. Under Parts C and D, private insurers are paid a monthly \"capitated\" amount to provide enrollees with required benefits. Medicare is required to pay for all covered services provided to eligible persons, so long as specific criteria are met. Since 1965, the Medicare program has undergone considerable change. For example, during the 111th Congress, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148 and P.L. 111-152) made numerous changes to the Medicare program that modified provider reimbursements, provided incentives to increase the quality and efficiency of care, and enhanced certain Medicare benefits. In the 114th Congress, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA; P.L. 114-10) changed the method for calculating updates to Medicare payment rates to physicians and altered how physicians and other practitioners will be paid in the future. Projections of future Medicare expenditures and funding indicate that the program will place increasing financial demands on the federal budget and on beneficiaries. For example, the Hospital Insurance (Part A) trust fund is projected to become insolvent in 2026. Additionally, although the Supplementary Medical Insurance (Parts B and D) trust fund is financed in large part through federal general revenues and cannot become insolvent, associated spending growth is expected to put increasing strains on the country's competing spending priorities.

The report is quite detailed, so I need to identify the main sections and their summaries.\n\nFirst, the report discusses the U.S. foreign aid program, its objectives, costs, and organization. It mentions that foreign aid is the largest component of the international affairs budget and has been a key part of U.S. foreign policy for decades. The focus of foreign aid has shifted over time, especially after the 9/11 attacks, with global development becoming a third pillar of national security, alongside defense and diplomacy.\n\nThe report also covers the evolution of foreign aid, including the shift from traditional foreign operations and international food aid to nontraditional aid funded by other agencies like the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy. These nontraditional programs, such as the Nunn-Lugar initiative, aimed at securing and eliminating weapons of mass destruction, especially in the former Soviet Union, have been significant in the context of U.S. foreign policy.\n\nThe report addresses the different rationales for foreign aid, such as national security, commercial interests, and humanitarian concerns. It also outlines the various objectives of aid, including promoting economic growth, improving governance, addressing population growth, expanding access to education and health care, protecting the environment, promoting stability in conflictive regions, protecting human rights, promoting trade, curbing weapons proliferation, strengthening allies, and addressing drug production and trafficking.\n\nThe report explains the different types of foreign aid, such as military, bilateral development, multilateral development, humanitarian assistance, political/strategic, and nonmilitary security activities. It also mentions the five strategic objectives set by the State Department in 2006: Peace and Security; Investing in People; Governing Justly and Democratically; Economic Growth; and Humanitarian Assistance.\n\nThe report provides data on the U.S. foreign aid budget, including the total amount obligated in FY2017, which was $49.9 billion. It breaks down the aid into different categories, such as bilateral development assistance, humanitarian assistance, and multilateral aid. The report also discusses the role of Congress in authorizing and overseeing foreign aid programs, as well as the various committees involved in the process.\n\nThe report highlights the importance of foreign aid in achieving U.S. national security goals, promoting economic growth, and addressing humanitarian crises.

On the basis of national security, commercial, and humanitarian rationales, U.S. assistance flows through many federal agencies and supports myriad objectives. These include promoting economic growth, reducing poverty, improving governance, expanding access to health care and education, promoting stability in conflict regions, countering terrorism, promoting human rights, strengthening allies, and curbing illicit drug production and trafficking. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, foreign aid has increasingly been associated with national security policy. At the same time, many Americans and some Members of Congress view foreign aid as an expense that the United States cannot afford given current budget deficits. In FY2017, U.S. foreign assistance, defined broadly, totaled an estimated $49.87 billion, or 1.2% of total federal budget authority. About 44% of this assistance was for bilateral economic development programs, including political/strategic economic assistance; 35% for military aid and nonmilitary security assistance; 18% for humanitarian activities; and 4% to support the work of multilateral institutions. Assistance can take the form of cash transfers, equipment and commodities, infrastructure, or technical assistance, and, in recent decades, is provided almost exclusively on a grant rather than loan basis. Most U.S. aid is implemented by nongovernmental organizations rather than foreign governments. The United States is the largest foreign aid donor in the world, accounting for about 24% of total official development assistance from major donor governments in 2017 (the latest year for which these data are available). Key foreign assistance trends in the past decade include growth in development aid, particularly global health programs; increased security assistance directed toward U.S. allies in the anti-terrorism effort; and high levels of humanitarian assistance to address a range of crises. Adjusted for inflation, annual foreign assistance funding over the past decade was the highest it has been since the Marshall Plan in the years immediately following World War II. In FY2017, Afghanistan, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, and Egypt received the largest amounts of U.S. aid, reflecting long-standing aid commitments to Israel and Egypt, the strategic significance of Afghanistan and Iraq, and the strategic and humanitarian importance of Jordan as the crisis in neighboring Syria continues. The Near East region received 27% of aid allocated by country or region in FY2017, followed by Africa, at 25%, and South and Central Asia, at 15%. This was a significant shift from a decade prior, when Africa received 19% of aid and the Near East 34%, reflecting significant increases in HIV/AIDS-related programs concentrated in Africa between FY2007 and FY2017 and the drawdown of U.S. military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Military assistance to Iraq began to decline starting in FY2011, but growing concern about the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has reversed this trend.

It is intended to provide a broad view of foreign assistance over time, and will be updated periodically.

{"pred": " The National Popular Vote (NPV) initiative aims to achieve direct popular election of the President and Vice President without a constitutional amendment, by creating an interstate compact. This compact would require participating states to appoint electors pledged to the candidate who wins the national popular vote. If all 50 states and the District of Columbia joined, the compact would ensure that the candidate with the most popular votes becomes President and Vice President, effectively replacing the electoral college system with a direct popular vote. The initiative was launched in 2006 and has gained traction in several states, including Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Washington, Massachusetts, and the District of Columbia, which together hold 189 electoral votes. However, the initiative has not yet reached the 270 electoral votes needed to activate the compact. The NPV initiative is supported by some Democratic-leaning states and has faced criticism from opponents who argue that it is unconstitutional or an end run around the Constitution's amendment process. The initiative is also subject to the Compact Clause of the Constitution, which requires congressional consent for interstate compacts. The NPV initiative has been introduced in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, with some form of active consideration in 38 states. The initiative has faced challenges in gaining support from Republican-controlled state legislatures, which have historically been less supportive of the NPV. The NPV initiative has generated interest among supporters of direct popular election of the President, but has not yet gained widespread public awareness. The March 2019 Politico/Morning Consult survey suggested that greater public knowledge of NPV might lead to increased support for the compact, potentially encouraging further state adoptions, particularly in populous states like Florida, Georgia, and Ohio, where the compact was under active consideration in 2019. The initiative's success depends on achieving the 270 electoral votes threshold, which would ensure the compact's effectiveness in delivering the national popular vote winner as President and Vice President. The NPV initiative has been a subject of debate, with supporters arguing for its democratic benefits and opponents raising constitutional and procedural concerns. The initiative's future depends on the support of additional states, particularly those with significant electoral votes, and the willingness of Congress to address the constitutional implications of the NPV compact.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about the National Popular Vote (NPV) initiative. Let me start by understanding the key points from the report.\n\nFirst, the NPV initiative is an interstate compact that would effectively", "answers": ["The National Popular Vote (NPV) initiative proposes an agreement among the states, an interstate compact that would effectively achieve direct popular election of the President and Vice President without a constitutional amendment. It relies on the Constitution's grant of authority to the states in Article II, Section 1 to appoint presidential electors \"in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct.... \" Any state that joins the NPV compact pledges that if the compact comes into effect, its legislature will award all the state's electoral votes to the presidential ticket that wins the most popular votes nationwide, regardless of who wins in that particular state. The compact would, however, come into effect only if its success has been assured; that is, only if states controlling a majority of electoral votes (270 or more) join the compact. By early May 2019, 14 states and the District of Columbia had joined the compact. After early momentum—eight states and the District of Columbia joined the NPV Compact between 2007 and 2011—the pace of state accessions slowed through 2018. Since then, four additional states joined, bringing the total number of electoral votes controlled by NPV member states to 189. During the same period, legislation to join the compact had been introduced during the current session in at least one chamber of the legislature in 14 additional states that control an additional 150 electors. The NPV initiative emerged following the presidential election of 2000, in which one ticket gained an electoral vote majority, winning the presidency, but received fewer popular votes than its opponents. NPV grew out of subsequent discussions among scholars and activists about how to avoid similar outcomes in the future and to achieve direct popular election. Proponents of NPV assert that it would guarantee the presidential candidates who win the most popular votes nationwide will always win the presidency; that it would end the inequities of the general ticket/winner-take-all system of awarding electoral votes; and that candidates would extend their focus beyond winning the \"battleground states,\" campaigning more widely and devoting greater attention to issues of concern to other parts of the country. They further assert that NPV would accomplish this while avoiding the exacting standards set for the proposal and ratification of constitutional amendments. Opponents argue that NPV would undermine the authority of states under the Constitution and the Founders' intention that presidential elections should be both national and federal contests; that it is an admitted \"end run\" around the Constitution that would circumvent the amendment process; and that it might actually lead to more disputed presidential elections characterized by politically contentious state recounts. The NPV has also been debated on legal grounds. Some observers maintain that it must be approved by Congress, because it is an interstate compact that would affect key provisions of constitutional presidential election procedures. NPV Inc., the organization managing the initiative's advocacy campaign, responds that congressional approval is not necessary because NPV concerns the appointment of electors, a subject that falls within state constitutional authority, and that the Supreme Court has previously rejected arguments that similar compacts would impair the rights of nonmember states. Other critics claim that NPV might violate the Voting Rights Act by diluting minority voter influence and avoiding the recently invalidated preclearance requirement for election procedure changes in covered jurisdictions. In response, NPV Inc. has asserted that the compact is \"entirely consistent with the goal of the Voting Rights Act.\" This report monitors the NPV's progress in the states and will identify and analyze further developments as warranted."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10755}
{"pred": " \n\nThe report highlights the federal government's significant investment in information technology (IT), with a budget of over $96 billion for fiscal year 2018, the largest ever. However, despite these substantial investments, the report notes that many federal IT projects have historically resulted in cost overruns, schedule delays, and limited mission outcomes. Examples include the tri-agency National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, which was disbanded after 16 years and $5 billion in spending, and the Department of Homeland Security’s Secure Border Initiative Network, which was ended after spending over $1 billion. The report also discusses the challenges in managing federal IT, including the lack of disciplined and effective management, such as project planning, requirements definition, and program oversight and governance. Additionally, the report highlights the security deficiencies in federal IT systems, which can threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. The report also discusses the various legislative actions and initiatives aimed at addressing these issues, including the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA), the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA), and the Modernizing Government Technology (MGT) Act. These laws and initiatives aim to improve the management of IT acquisitions and operations, enhance cybersecurity, and achieve cost savings. The report also outlines the progress made by agencies in implementing these initiatives, as well as the challenges that remain. Overall, the report emphasizes the need for continued efforts to improve the management and security of federal IT, in order to achieve cost savings and better serve the public.\n\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report.

However, the report points out that despite these large investments, many federal IT projects have resulted in failed projects with cost overruns, schedule slippages, and little to no mission-related outcomes. The report gives several examples of such failures, like the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, which was disbanded after 16 years and $5 billion. There's also the Secure Border Initiative Network, which was ended after spending over $1 billion. The VA's Financial and Logistics Integrated Technology Enterprise was terminated in 2011, and the DoD's Expeditionary Combat Support System was canceled in 2012. The", "answers": ["The federal government plans to invest almost $96 billion in IT in fiscal year 2018. Historically, IT investments have too often failed or contributed little to mission-related outcomes. Further, increasingly sophisticated threats and frequent cyber incidents underscore the need for effective information security. As a result, GAO added two areas to its high-risk list: IT security in 1997 and the management of IT acquisitions and operations in 2015. This statement summarizes agencies' progress in improving IT management and ensuring the security of federal IT. It is primarily based on GAO's prior reports issued between February 1997 and May 2018 (and an ongoing review) on (1) CIO responsibilities, (2) agency CIOs' involvement in approving IT contracts, (3) data center consolidation efforts, (4) the management of software licenses, and (5) compliance with cybersecurity requirements. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and federal agencies have taken steps to improve the management of information technology (IT) acquisitions and operations and ensure the security of federal IT through a series of initiatives. As of May 2018, agencies had fully implemented about 61 percent of the approximately 800 IT management-related recommendations that GAO made from fiscal years 2010 through 2015. Likewise, since 2010, agencies had implemented about 66 percent of the approximately 2,700 security-related recommendations as of May 2018. Even with this progress, significant actions remain to be completed. Chief Information Officer (CIO) responsibilities . Laws such as the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) and related guidance assigned 35 key IT management responsibilities to CIOs to help address longstanding challenges. However, in a draft report on CIO responsibilities, GAO's preliminary results suggest that none of the 24 selected agencies have policies that fully address the role of their CIO, as called for by federal laws and guidance. GAO intends to recommend that OMB and each of the selected 24 agencies take actions to improve the effectiveness of CIO's implementation of their responsibilities. IT contract approval . According to FITARA, covered agencies' CIOs are required to review and approve IT contracts. Nevertheless, in January 2018, GAO reported that most of the CIOs at 22 selected agencies were not adequately involved in reviewing billions of dollars of IT acquisitions. Consequently, GAO made 39 recommendations to improve CIO oversight over IT acquisitions. Consolidating data centers . OMB launched an initiative in 2010 to reduce data centers, which was codified and expanded in FITARA. According to agencies, data center consolidation and optimization efforts have resulted in approximately $3.9 billion of cost savings through 2018. Even so, additional work remains. GAO has made 160 recommendations to OMB and agencies to improve the reporting of related cost savings and to achieve optimization targets; however, as of May 2018, 80 of the recommendations have not been fully addressed. Managing software licenses . Effective management of software licenses can help avoid purchasing too many licenses that result in unused software. In May 2014, GAO reported that better management of licenses was needed to achieve savings, and made 135 recommendations to improve such management. Four years later, 78 of the recommendations remained open. Improving the security of federal IT systems . While the government has acted to protect federal information systems, agencies need to improve security programs, cyber capabilities, and the protection of personally identifiable information. Over the last several years, GAO has made about 2,700 recommendations to agencies aimed at improving the security of federal systems and information. These recommendations identified actions for agencies to take to strengthen their information security programs and technical controls over their computer networks and systems. As of May 2018, about 800 of the information security-related recommendations had not been implemented. From fiscal years 2010 through 2015, GAO made about 800 recommendations to OMB and federal agencies to address shortcomings in IT acquisitions and operations. Since 2010, GAO also made about 2,700 recommendations to federal agencies to improve the security of federal systems. These recommendations include those to improve the implementation of CIO responsibilities, the oversight of the data center consolidation initiative, software license management efforts, and the strength of security programs and technical controls. Most agencies agreed with these recommendations, and GAO will continue to monitor their implementation."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6259}
{"pred": " \n\nThe report provides an in-depth analysis of the Bosnian conflict from 1992 to 1995, its aftermath, and the ongoing challenges faced by Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) in the Western Balkans. The conflict, which resulted in significant loss of life and displacement, was a pivotal moment in U.S. foreign policy in Europe, leading to U.S. involvement in brokering the Dayton Peace Agreement. The report outlines the complex political structure established by the Dayton Agreement, which divides BiH into two ethnoterritorial entities: Republika Srpska (RS) and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH). These entities have significant policy jurisdiction, including civilian policing, economic policy, fiscal policy, energy policy, and health and social policy. The political system is characterized by ethnic divisions, with ethnicity as a core basis of political identity. The ethnic parties that have dominated politics since the war generally appeal to voters from their respective ethnic communities rather than all Bosnians. Critics accuse ethnic party leaders of inflaming nationalist tensions and manipulating historical memory to distract from corruption and win elections, thus aggravating rather than bridging the deep wounds that remain from the war. The report also highlights the challenges of reforming the political system, including the entrenched ethnic parties' resistance to change, the complexity of the political structure, and the lack of political will to find common ground. The report discusses the role of the international community, including the United States and the European Union, in Bosnia's political and security affairs. The U.S. has played a key role in brokering several agreements, including the Dayton Peace Agreement, and has deployed troops to Bosnia. The report also addresses the impact of external influences, including Russia, Turkey, and China, on Bosnia's political and economic landscape. The report concludes that Bosnia's political system, while complex and prone to gridlock, remains a critical factor in the country's future, and that U.S. engagement with Bosnia is essential to address ongoing challenges and promote stability in the Western Balkans.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this detailed report about Bosnia. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report talks about the 1992-1995 war in Bosnia, the U.S. role in intervening, the Dayton Peace Agreement, and the ongoing challenges Bosnia faces. It also covers the political structure established by Dayton, ethnic divisions, corruption", "answers": ["Bosnia and Herzegovina (hereafter, \"Bosnia\") drew heavily on U.S. support after gaining independence from Yugoslavia in 1992. The United States helped end the Bosnian war (1992-1995), one of the most lethal conflicts in Europe since the Second World War, by leading NATO airstrikes against Bosnian Serb forces, brokering the Dayton Peace Agreement in 1995, and deploying 20,000 U.S. troops. Some Members of Congress became involved in policy debates over these measures, and Congress monitored and at times challenged the Bush and Clinton Administrations' response through numerous hearings, resolutions, and legislative proposals. Since 1995, the United States has been a major source of aid to Bosnia and firmly supports its territorial integrity. The United States also supports Bosnia's aspirations for NATO and European Union (EU) membership. Today, Bosnia faces serious challenges. Nearly 25 years after the Dayton Agreement, Bosnia continues to use part of the Agreement as its constitution, which divides the country into two ethnoterritorial entities. Critics charge that Bosnia's political system is too decentralized to enact the reforms required for NATO and EU membership. They also contend that the ethnic power-sharing arrangements and veto points embedded in numerous government bodies are sources of gridlock. Domestic and international courts have ruled against several aspects of Bosnia's constitution, yet the Bosnian government thus far has failed to implement these rulings. Since Bosnia's independence, its politics has been dominated by ethnic parties representing the country's three main groups: Bosniaks (Slavic Muslims), Croats, and Serbs. These parties have prospered under a system that critics charge lacks transparency and accountability. Critics also maintain that ethnic party leaders use divisive nationalist rhetoric to distract from serious issues affecting the country as a whole, including poverty, unemployment, and stalled political reforms. The Bosnian population exhibits low trust in political parties and the government, and disaffection toward the country's elite. U.S. and EU officials brokered several ultimately unsuccessful rounds of constitutional reform negotiations, and continue to call on Bosnia's leaders to implement reforms to make governance more efficient and effective, dismantle patronage networks, and bring Bosnia closer to EU and NATO membership. However, there is little consensus among the country's leaders on how the country should be reformed. Bosnian Serb leaders from the Serb-majority entity (Republika Srpska) have called for greater autonomy and even secession from Bosnia. Some Bosnian Croat leaders have called for partitioning Bosnia's other entity, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to create a separate Croat-majority entity. Bosniak leaders, by contrast, generally prefer a more centralized state. Many analysts caution that any move to partition the country could lead to renewed violence, while greater decentralization could make Bosnia's government less functional. U.S. policy has long been oriented toward preserving Bosnia's statehood. Bosnia's 2018 general elections largely returned to power the same entrenched ethnic parties. Of particular concern is the election of Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik to Bosnia's collective presidency. Dodik, a sharp critic of the United States and NATO, has periodically called for a referendum on Republika Srpska's secession. He is under U.S. sanctions for obstructing the Dayton Agreement. In addition to these internal challenges, U.S. and EU officials have expressed concern over external influence in the region. Russia reportedly relies on soft power, energy leverage, and \"spoiler\" tactics to influence Bosnia, particularly in the Serb-majority entity. Turkish soft power draws on Bosnia's Ottoman-era heritage and Turkey's shared religious tradition with Bosniaks. China is a more recent presence in the region, but its heavy investments and lending have prompted concern on both sides of the Atlantic. Policymakers have also expressed concern at the challenges posed by the return of Bosnians who fought with the Islamic State and Nusra Front in Syria and Iraq. Many observers contend that the United States remains a stakeholder in Bosnia's future because of its central role in resolving the conflict and shaping the postwar Bosnian state. Given the history of U.S. involvement in Bosnia, Bosnia's importance to regional stability in the Balkans, and concerns over Russian and Chinese influence in Bosnia, Members of Congress may be interested in monitoring how the country navigates its internal and external challenges. Congress may also consider future U.S. aid levels to Bosnia and the degree to which such assistance supports the long-standing U.S. policy objectives for Bosnia of territorial integrity, NATO and EU integration, energy security, and resilience against malign influence."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8598}
{"pred": " The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the federal judiciary play critical roles in requesting and collecting restitution for victims of federal crimes. DOJ's Criminal Division and the 94 U.S. Attorneys' Offices (USAOs) are responsible for identifying victims, determining losses, and negotiating restitution as part of plea agreements. The Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section manages DOJ's Asset Forfeiture Program, which can be used to compensate victims. Federal prosecutors and FLU staff work together to ensure restitution is ordered and collected. The DOJ's EOUSA provides management assistance, guidance, training, and administrative support to USAOs. The federal judiciary, including the 94 federal district courts, is responsible for ordering restitution, receiving payments, and disbursing funds to victims. Probation officers prepare the presentence investigation report (PSR), which includes information on victims' losses and offenders' financial information. The court uses the PSR to determine whether to order restitution. If the court does not order restitution, or orders only partial restitution, the judge must provide the reason, and judges usually do so in a written Statement of Reasons document. The U.S. Sentencing Commission (USSC) collects and analyzes sentencing data, including information on restitution orders. According to our analysis of USSC data, 15 percent of federal offenders sentenced from fiscal years 2014 through 2016 were ordered to pay restitution, totaling $33.9 billion. The majority of offenders were sentenced for immigration or drug-related offenses, which typically do not have victims with actual losses. Courts ordered restitution more frequently for offenders convicted of fraud, with 74 percent of these offenders ordered to pay restitution. The percentage of federal offenders ordered to pay restitution varied across districts, from 2 percent to 42 percent. Courts may not order restitution for various reasons, such as when victims provide no proof of their losses, when victims recover compensation through other means, or when there is no identifiable victim. If a court does not order restitution, or orders only partial restitution, it is required to provide the reason, and judges usually do so in a written Statement of Reasons document. However, our analysis showed that USSC did not always have these data.

Various entities within the federal government are involved in the process of requesting, ordering, and collecting restitution for crime victims, including DOJ and the judiciary. The Justice for All Reauthorization Act of 2016 includes a provision for GAO to review the federal criminal restitution process for fiscal years 2014 through 2016. This report addresses, among other things: (1) the extent to which information is available on restitution requested by DOJ and ordered by courts; (2) the amount of restitution debt DOJ collected and the amount that remains outstanding; and, (3) the extent to which DOJ has conducted oversight on the collection of restitution. GAO analyzed laws, policies and procedures as well as USSC data on restitution orders and DOJ data on restitution collected from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. GAO also selected a non-generalizable sample of six federal judicial districts based on restitution collections and spoke with USAO officials and federal probation officers. Officials from selected U.S. Attorney's Offices (USAO) stated that they document requests for restitution in case files and employ other internal controls, such as the use of templates and forms, throughout the prosecution process to ensure that prosecutors request restitution as appropriate. GAO's analysis of U.S. Sentencing Commission (USSC) data—an agency within the judiciary—showed that information on restitution orders was available for 95 percent of all offenders sentenced from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. Specifically, 214,578 federal offenders were sentenced during this time period and restitution was ordered for 33,158, or 15 percent, of those offenders. Collectively, courts ordered these offenders to pay $33.9 billion in restitution. Most federal offenders sentenced during these years were sentenced for immigration or drug-related offenses. In interviews, USAO officials stated that these offenses do not typically have victims requiring restitution. GAO found that data on reasons why restitution was not ordered were incomplete for 5 percent of all offenders sentenced from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. Determining why data on restitution orders are incomplete may inform the judiciary of the cause of the incomplete data and any efforts needed to improve USSC data. GAO's analysis of Department of Justice (DOJ) data showed that USAOs collected $2.95 billion in restitution debt in fiscal years 2014 through 2016, see figure below. However, at the end of fiscal year 2016, $110 billion in previously ordered restitution remained outstanding, and USAOs identified $100 billion of that outstanding debt as uncollectible due to offenders' inability to pay. DOJ identified improving debt collection—including restitution—as a major management initiative in its 2014-2018 Strategic Plan. While DOJ is developing analytical tools to monitor the collection of restitution, it has not established performance measures or goals. Performance measures and goals would allow DOJ to gauge USAOs' success in collecting restitution and, by extension, the department's success in achieving a major management initiative. GAO is making three recommendations. GAO is making one to the judiciary to determine why data on restitution orders are incomplete. GAO is making two recommendations to DOJ, including one to implement performance measures and goals for the collection of restitution.

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report explains that FMAGs are authorized by Section 420 of the Stafford Act. They were established by regulation in 2001. These grants help with fire suppression activities. The President can declare an FMAG, and this authority is delegated to FEMA's Regional Administrators. Once declared, FMAGs provide federal assistance like equipment, personnel, and grants to state, local, and tribal governments for controlling and mitigating fires on public or private forest or grassland. There's a cost-sharing component where the state, local, and tribal governments are responsible for 25% of the expenses. The report addresses frequently asked questions about FMAGs, including how they are requested, evaluated using thresholds, and the types of assistance provided.\n\nFMAGs can be requested by a state when the governor determines a fire is out of control and threatens a major disaster. Requests are submitted to FEMA, typically the Regional Administrator. Requests can be made anytime, even by phone, but must be followed by written confirmation within 14 days. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 allows tribes to request FMAGs similarly to states. However, some tribal lands are administered by the federal government, so they receive support through the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), which doesn't require reimbursement. Tribes with their own fire suppression resources may get reimbursement from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA).\n\nThe FMAG request includes cost estimates, fire size, population threatened, evacuations, weather conditions, and state/local resources. A verbal request must be followed by the completed FEMA form 078-0-1 and the Principal Advisor's Report. The evaluation criteria include threat to lives and property, availability of state and local resources, high fire danger conditions, and potential economic impacts. FEMA uses fire cost thresholds, which are updated annually. There are individual thresholds for a single fire and cumulative thresholds for multiple fires. For example, Pennsylvania's individual threshold is $927,274, and cumulative is $2,781,822. Alaska's individual is $100,000, cumulative is $500,000.

{"pred": " The Indian Health Service (IHS) is a federal agency established in 1955 to provide health care services to American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities, particularly in rural and isolated areas. IHS operates a network of hospitals, clinics, and health stations, and also provides funding to tribally operated facilities. In fiscal year 2017, IHS allocated about $1.9 billion for health services provided by federally and tribally operated facilities. Federally operated IHS facilities, which received over 5.2 million outpatient visits and over 15,000 inpatient admissions in 2016, provide mostly primary and emergency care, as well as some ancillary and specialty services in 26 hospitals, 55 health centers, and 21 health stations. The 12 IHS area offices are responsible for distributing funds to the facilities in their areas, monitoring their operation, and providing guidance and technical assistance. In addition, five human resources regional offices assist the area offices in the recruitment and hiring of providers. IHS facilities employ both federal civil service personnel and Commissioned Corps officers. IHS may pay higher salaries for certain federal civil service providers through the development and implementation of special pay tables, which specify the ranges of salaries that these certain providers can receive. According to IHS officials, the Commissioned Corps officers follow the same process for applying for positions at IHS as federal civil service employees. However, the Commissioned Corps officers are uniformed health professionals whose pay and allowances are different. IHS also supplements its workforce capacity with both temporary and long-term contracts with individual physicians or a medical staffing company. IHS officials have experienced considerable challenges in filling vacancies for providers, which has negative effects on patient care and provider satisfaction. The rural locations and geographic isolation of some IHS facilities create recruitment and retention difficulties. IHS data indicate that 36 of the 102 IHS facilities, including four hospitals, are identified as isolated hardship (ISOHAR) posts. These posts are described as “unusually difficult, which may present moderate to severe physical hardships for individuals assigned to that geographic location,” and include factors such as crime or violence, pollution, isolation, a harsh climate, scarcity of goods on the local market, and other problems. In addition, IHS has reported that insufficient housing, substandard schools, lack of entertainment opportunities, and shopping centers located more than three hours away are all typical not only of ISOHAR posts, but", "answers": ["IHS is charged with providing health care to AI/AN people who are members or descendants of 573 tribes. According to IHS, AI/AN people born today have a life expectancy that is 5.5 years less than all races in the United States, and they die at higher rates than other Americans from preventable causes. The ability to recruit and retain a stable clinical workforce capable of providing quality and timely care is critical for IHS. GAO was asked to review provider vacancies at IHS. This report examines (1) IHS provider vacancies and challenges filling them; (2) strategies IHS has used to recruit and retain providers; and (3) strategies IHS has used to mitigate the negative effects of provider vacancies. GAO reviewed IHS human resources data for the provider positions that the agency tracks. GAO also reviewed policies, federal internal control standards, and legal authorities related to providers in federally operated IHS facilities. GAO interviewed IHS officials at the headquarters and area level and at selected facilities. GAO selected facilities based on variation in their number of direct care outpatient visits and inpatient hospital beds in 2014. Indian Health Service (IHS) data show sizeable vacancy rates for clinical care providers in the eight IHS geographic areas where the agency provides substantial direct care to American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) people. The overall vacancy rate for providers—physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, certified registered nurse anesthetists, certified nurse midwives, physician assistants, dentists, and pharmacists—was 25 percent, ranging from 13 to 31 percent across the areas. IHS officials told GAO that challenges to filling these vacancies include the rural location of many IHS facilities and insufficient housing for providers. Officials said long-standing vacancies have a negative effect on patient access, quality of care, and employee morale. IHS uses multiple strategies to recruit and retain providers, including offering increased salaries for certain positions, but it still faces challenges matching local market salaries. IHS also offers other financial incentives, and has made some housing available when possible. In addition, IHS uses strategies, such as contracting with temporary providers, to maintain patient access to services and reduce provider burnout. Officials said these temporary providers are more costly than salaried employees and can interrupt patients' continuity of care. However, IHS lacks agency-wide information on the costs and number of temporary providers used at its facilities, which impedes IHS officials' ability to target its resources to address gaps in provider staffing and ensure access to health services across IHS facilities. GAO recommends that IHS obtain, on an agency-wide basis, information on temporary provider contractors, including their associated cost and number of full-time equivalents, and use this information to inform decisions about resource allocation and provider staffing.

{"pred": " The report discusses the current state of the U.S. Navy's attack submarine fleet, highlighting both the safety measures in place and the significant maintenance challenges faced by the Navy. The fleet consists of 51 submarines, including 33 Los Angeles class, 3 Seawolf class, and 15 Virginia class submarines, homeported across the United States and in Guam. The report emphasizes the importance of the SUBSAFE program, which was established following the tragic sinking of the USS Thresher in 1963. This program ensures that submarines meet strict safety standards, preventing catastrophic flooding and allowing for emergency surfacing. Since its implementation, no SUBSAFE-certified submarine has been lost, underscoring the program's effectiveness. However, the report also highlights persistent maintenance delays that have led to significant idle time for attack submarines. Between fiscal years 2008 and 2018, the Navy experienced 10,363 days of idle time and maintenance delays, with 82% of these days attributed to depot maintenance delays. These delays have resulted in substantial operating and support costs, with the report estimating that the Navy has spent over $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2018 constant dollars on attack submarines that were delayed in getting into and out of the shipyards. The report attributes these delays to a combination of factors, including workforce shortages, inexperience, poor facility conditions, parts shortages, changes in planned maintenance work, and weather. The Navy has taken some steps to address these issues, such as hiring more personnel for the shipyards and developing a shipyard optimization plan. However, the report notes that these efforts are not yet sufficient to address the ongoing maintenance challenges. The report also discusses the potential benefits of utilizing private shipyards for attack submarine maintenance, including the ability to reduce idle time and improve operational availability. However, the Navy has not yet conducted a comprehensive business case analysis to inform maintenance workload allocation between public and private shipyards, which is necessary to fully address the challenges and optimize the Navy's attack submarine readiness. The report concludes that without addressing these challenges, the Navy will continue to incur significant costs and risks to its attack submarine fleet, and it will not achieve the full benefit of the nation's investment in these critical assets.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report.

These capabilities make attack submarines some of the most–requested assets by the global combatant commanders. GAO was asked to review the readiness of the Navy's attack submarine force. This report discusses the extent to which the Navy (1) has experienced maintenance delays in its attack submarine fleet and costs associated with any delays; and (2) has addressed any challenges and developed mitigation plans for any maintenance delays. GAO analyzed readiness information from fiscal years 2008-2018, operating and support costs, maintenance performance, and other data; visited attack submarines and squadrons; and interviewed public and private shipyard and fleet officials. This is a public version of a classified report issued in October 2018. Information the Department of Defense deemed classified or sensitive, such as attack submarine force structure requirements and detailed data on attack submarine maintenance delays, has been omitted. The Navy has been unable to begin or complete the vast majority of its attack submarine maintenance periods on time resulting in significant maintenance delays and operating and support cost expenditures. GAO's analysis of Navy maintenance data shows that between fiscal year 2008 and 2018, attack submarines have incurred 10,363 days of idle time and maintenance delays as a result of delays in getting into and out of the shipyards. For example, the Navy originally scheduled the USS Boise to enter a shipyard for an extended maintenance period in 2013 but, due to heavy shipyard workload, the Navy delayed the start of the maintenance period. In June 2016, the USS Boise could no longer conduct normal operations and the boat has remained idle, pierside for over two years since then waiting to enter a shipyard (see figure). GAO estimated that since fiscal year 2008 the Navy has spent more than $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2018 constant dollars to support attack submarines that provide no operational capability—those sitting idle while waiting to enter the shipyards, and those delayed in completing their maintenance at the shipyards. The Navy has started to address challenges related to workforce shortages and facilities needs at the public shipyards. However, it has not effectively allocated maintenance periods among public shipyards and private shipyards that may also be available to help minimize attack submarine idle time. GAO's analysis found that while the public shipyards have operated above capacity for the past several years, attack submarine maintenance delays are getting longer and idle time is increasing. The Navy may have options to mitigate this idle time and maintenance delays by leveraging private shipyard capacity for repair work. But the Navy has not completed a comprehensive business case analysis as recommended by Department of Defense guidelines to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards. Navy leadership has acknowledged that they need to be more proactive in leveraging potential private shipyard repair capacity. Without addressing this challenge, the Navy risks continued expenditure of operating and support funding to crew, maintain, and support attack submarines that provide no operational capability because they are delayed in getting into and out of maintenance. GAO recommends that the Navy conduct a business case analysis to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards.

The main issue is whether to approve, reject, or modify the DOD's acquisition strategies and funding levels for the program. The summary should cover the program's background, its role in missile defense, the current status of Aegis ships, the development of BMD capabilities, funding issues, and potential congressional actions.\n\nFirst, the Aegis system was originally developed in the 1970s for defending ships against aircraft, anti-ship cruise missiles, surface threats, and subsurface threats. It was first deployed in 1983 and has been updated many times since. The Navy's Aegis ships include Ticonderoga (CG-47) class cruisers and Arleigh Burke (DDG-51) class destroyers. The report gives details about the procurement numbers and service dates for these ships. For example, the CG-47s were procured between FY1978 and FY1988, entering service between 1983 and 1994. Some were retired in 2004-2005. The DDG-51s have different versions, with Flight III having the new SPY-6 radar.

The report is about U.S. government agencies and their activities related to promoting exports, with a specific focus on tobacco products. \n\nFirst, the report mentions that several agencies, including State, Commerce, and USDA, have restrictions on using funds to promote the sale or export of U.S. tobacco products. These restrictions have been in place since the 1990s. The reason for these restrictions is related to health policy and initiatives, both domestically and internationally. \n\nThe report also discusses how these agencies have implemented these restrictions through various guidance documents, such as the interagency guidance cable. However, there are issues with the clarity of these guidelines, and not all officials are aware of the restrictions. \n\nThe report found that while most officials were aware of the restrictions, some had not received training on them. Additionally, the guidance cables are not always distributed effectively, leading to confusion. \n\nThe report also mentions that the U.S. exported over $2 billion in tobacco and tobacco-related products in 2017. Despite the restrictions, there are concerns about the guidance being unclear in areas like attending events with tobacco company representatives or the types of services allowed. \n\nThe recommendations from the report include updating training materials to include information about the restrictions and revising the interagency guidance cable to address ambiguities. \n\nNow, I need to condense all this into a one-page summary. I should start by outlining the key points: the agencies involved, the restrictions on tobacco promotion, the implementation through guidance cables, the awareness and training issues, and the recommendations. \n\nI need to make sure the summary is concise, covers all the main points without getting too detailed. Also, since it's a one-page summary, I should avoid any markdown formatting and keep the language clear and straightforward. \n\nLet me structure the summary as follows:\n\n1. Introduction: Mention the purpose of the report, which is to examine the guidance issued by U.S. agencies to implement funding restrictions on promoting tobacco exports, the awareness of these restrictions among overseas officials, and the extent to which the guidance has been implemented.\n\n2. Overview of Restrictions: Explain that since the 1990s, Congress has restricted the use of funds for State, Commerce, and USDA to promote tobacco. The 2018 State Appropriations Act changed the restriction from \"shall\" to \"should,\" giving more", "answers": ["The World Health Organization estimates that tobacco use kills over 7 million people each year, more than tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and malaria combined. Since the 1990s, Congress has enacted restrictions regarding the use of certain appropriated funds to promote U.S. tobacco exports. GAO was asked to review the implementation of these restrictions. This report examines (1) guidance select U.S. agencies have issued to implement these restrictions, (2) whether overseas officials from select U.S. agencies were aware of the restrictions and guidance, and (3) select U.S. agencies' implementation of the guidance overseas. GAO reviewed U.S. laws, agency guidance, and internal communications; analyzed Commerce data; and interviewed agency officials in Washington, D.C. and in 24 offices across 11 overseas posts in 9 countries. GAO selected these countries based on criteria that included U.S. tobacco export totals, smoking rates, and geographic dispersion. Congress has restricted the use of certain appropriated funding to promote tobacco exports and the Departments of State (State), Commerce (Commerce), and Agriculture (USDA) have issued interagency guidance through the cable system that they rely on to implement these restrictions. State collaborates with these and other agencies to periodically update this cable. The cable informs officials about the types of actions they should take—such as providing routine business facilitation services to all U.S. companies—and the types of actions they should not take—such as attending events sponsored by tobacco companies. Most, but not all, officials overseas that GAO interviewed were aware of the restrictions and received some guidance concerning the restrictions. However, GAO found that some officials did not recall receiving the interagency guidance cable. In addition, State and USDA's current training materials do not address the restrictions. Federal internal control standards state that appropriate training is essential to an organization's operational success. Thus, providing officials overseas with training about the funding restrictions and related guidance would help to ensure that officials are aware of the restrictions. U.S. officials overseas have implemented restrictions on promoting tobacco, but some officials said that the interagency guidance lacks clarity. Officials said that they have not promoted tobacco by, for example, attending events sponsored solely by tobacco companies. However, officials identified three areas of the guidance that are unclear: (1) attendance at events not sponsored by U.S. tobacco companies but attended by representatives of these companies; (2) the types of services officials can provide tobacco companies; and (3) the description of tobacco products, such as whether component parts for electronic cigarettes are included. Federal standards for internal control state that management should clearly document internal controls in policies and guidance to prevent officials from failing to achieve an objective or address a risk. By providing more specific guidance, the agencies would help ensure that officials consistently implement the funding restrictions on promoting tobacco. GAO recommends that (1) State and USDA include information about the funding restrictions and guidance in training materials for relevant employees and (2) State, in consultation with Commerce and USDA, assess and update the interagency guidance cable, as needed, on promoting tobacco in light of questions raised by officials at posts overseas.

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report is about the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers and their handling of provider reviews and reporting to the National Practitioner Data Base (NPDB) and state licensing boards. The main findings are that there were significant issues with documentation and timeliness of reviews, as well as inadequate reporting of providers with clinical deficiencies.\n\nFirst, the report mentions that from October 2013 to March 2017, five VA medical centers had 148 providers reviewed after concerns were raised. However, officials couldn't provide documentation for almost half of these reviews. Specifically, there were issues with two types of reviews: FPPE for cause and retrospective reviews. For 26 providers, FPPEs for cause weren't documented, and for 21, they weren't conducted at all. Also, 8 providers had retrospective reviews not documented, and 12 had no documentation at all. The VA centers also didn't conduct reviews in a timely manner, with some cases taking up to three months or even years after concerns were raised.\n\nThe report identifies two main factors contributing to these issues: first, VHA policy doesn't require documentation for all reviews, and there's no timeliness requirement. Second, VHA's oversight is inadequate, with networks not overseeing the credentialing and privileging processes. The standardized audit tool doesn't require checking all reviews, and some VISN officials aren't using it as required.\n\nAdditionally, the report found that providers were not reported to the NPDB and state licensing boards as required. Reasons included VA officials not being familiar with or misinterpreting VHA policies, and VHA not requiring networks to oversee these reports. This lack of reporting allows providers with substandard care to move between VA facilities or other healthcare systems.\n\nThe report recommends that VHA require documentation of all reviews, establish timeliness requirements, and strengthen oversight by requiring networks to ensure reviews are documented and initiated on time. VHA concurred with these recommendations and plans to revise policies and update the audit tool.\n\nAnother issue was the failure to report providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards.

The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1743}

For an agency's action to be eligible for review under the CRA, it must qualify as a \"rule\" as defined by the statute. The class of rules covered by the CRA is broader than the category of rules that are subject to the Administrative Procedure Act's (APA) notice-and-comment requirements. As such, some agency actions, such as guidance documents, that are not subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures may still be considered rules under the CRA and thus could be overturned using the CRA's procedures. The 115th Congress used the CRA to pass, for the first time, a resolution of disapproval overturning an agency guidance document that had not been promulgated through notice-and-comment procedures. The resolution was signed into law by the President on May 21, 2018. In all of the previous instances in which the CRA was used to overturn agency actions, the disapproved actions were regulations that had been adopted through APA rulemaking processes. Congress's use of the CRA in this instance raised questions about the scope of the CRA and Congress's ability to use the CRA to overturn agency actions that were not promulgated through APA notice-and-comment procedures. Under the CRA, the expedited procedures for considering legislation to overturn rules become available only when agencies submit their rules to Congress.

The effect of Congress disapproving a rule that is not subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking may be subject to debate, given that such rules are generally viewed to lack any legal effect in the first place. Nonetheless, the CRA does encompass some such rules, as highlighted by the recent enactment of a CRA resolution overturning a bulletin from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that was not subject to the notice-and-comment procedures.

In many cases in which agencies take actions that fall under the scope of a \"rule\" but have not gone through notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures, agencies fail to submit those rules. Thus, questions have arisen as to how Members can avail themselves of the CRA's special fast-track procedures if the agency has not submitted the action to Congress. To protect its prerogative to review agency rules under the CRA, Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) have developed an ad hoc process in which Members can request that GAO provide a formal legal opinion on whether a particular agency action qualifies as a rule under the CRA. If GAO concludes that the action in question falls within the CRA's definition of \"rule,\" Congress has treated the publication of the GAO opinion in the Congressional Record as constructive submission of the rule. In other words, an affirmative opinion from GAO can allow Congress to use the CRA procedures to consider legislation overturning an agency action despite the agency not submitting that action to Congress."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12318}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is about the VA's challenges in aligning their services and real property with the needs of veterans. There are several key issues mentioned: geographic shifts in the veteran population, changes in healthcare delivery (like moving from inpatient to outpatient care), aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement. \n\nThe VA has a lot of old buildings that are either vacant or underutilized. Some of these are historic, which complicates their renovation or demolition. For example, in some cases, it's cheaper to demolish and rebuild, but if the building is historic, they can't. This leads to high upkeep costs and safety hazards. The report also mentions that VA has not consistently engaged stakeholders, leading to adversarial relationships and making it harder to align facilities with veterans' needs.\n\nThere are two main planning processes discussed: SCIP and VAIP. SCIP has limitations like subjective narratives, long timeframes, and restricted access to information. This causes delays in funding decisions, making it hard for local officials to plan. VAIP is supposed to create plans for each VISN and medical facility, but it assumes all future growth will be through VA facilities, which isn't accurate because VA also purchases care from non-VA providers. The report suggests that VA should consider discontinuing VAIP facility master plans or adjusting them to account for care in the community.\n\nThe report also compares VA's situation to the DOD's BRAC process, which had several elements that were effective. These included setting goals, developing criteria, estimating costs and savings, establishing an organizational structure, creating a common analytical framework, establishing oversight mechanisms, and involving the audit community. The BRAC process had challenges, such as the need for sustained senior leadership and coordination among stakeholders, and the complexity of interdependent recommendations. \n\nThe report concludes by suggesting that Congress might want to consider these elements from the BRAC process when evaluating proposed legislation for disposing of or realigning VA property. It also mentions that VA has agreed to some recommendations but hasn't taken significant action yet.\n\nNow, I need to condense all this into a one-page summary. I should start with the main issue: VA's challenges in aligning services and real property with veterans' needs. Then outline the key factors: geographic shifts, healthcare changes, aging infrastructure, and stakeholder involvement. Mention the vacant and underutilized buildings, the historical status complicating", "answers": ["VA operates one of the largest health care systems in the United States, utilizing more than 6,000 federally owned and 1,500 leased buildings. DOD has repeatedly applied the BRAC process to reduce the amount of unneeded property that it owns and leases and to save billions of dollars that could be applied to higher priority defense needs. This statement is based on GAO's April 2017 report related to VA facility alignment ( GAO-17-349 ) and numerous GAO reports related to the BRAC process as summarized in a June 2011 testimony ( GAO-11-704T ) and a March 2012 testimony ( GAO-12-513T ). This statement addresses (1) the factors that affect VA's facility alignment and the extent to which VA's capital-planning process facilitates the alignment of facilities with the veterans' population, and (2) the key elements and challenges affecting DOD and the Commission in BRAC 2005. Detailed information on our scope and methodologies for this work can be found in these published products, cited throughout this testimony. Geographic shifts in the veterans' population, changes in health care delivery, aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement affect the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) efforts to align its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. For example, a shift over time from inpatient to outpatient care will likely result in underutilized space once used for inpatient care. Further, the historic status of some VA facilities adds to the complexity of converting or disposing of them. In such instances, it is often difficult and costly for VA to modernize, renovate, and retrofit these older facilities. GAO reported that two of the planning processes VA uses to align its facilities—VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) and the VA Integrated Planning (VAIP)—have limitations that undermine VA's efforts to achieve its goals. Specifically: VA relies on the SCIP process to plan and prioritize capital projects, but VA routinely asks its facility planners to submit their next year's planned project narratives before knowing if their previous submissions have been funded. The overlapping budget cycle, which is outside of VA's control, combined with other SCIP limitations—including subjective narratives, long time frames, and restricted access to information—make it difficult for VA to rely on SCIP to accurately identify the capital necessary to address its service and infrastructure gaps. VA concurred that it needs to address SCIP limitations that are within its control, as GAO recommended; VA has made some progress in implementing the recommendation has made some progress in implementing the recommendation.\\ The VAIP process is estimated to cost $108 million and to produce market-level service delivery plans and facility master plans. However, the VAIP master plans incorrectly assume that all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities without considering alternatives, such as purchasing care from the community. GAO recommended that VA consider discontinuing the VAIP facility master plans pending an assessment of their value as a facility-planning tool. VA agreed with the recommendation and is implementing it while pursuing a national realignment strategy.. Key elements of the Department of Defense's (DOD) 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process could benefit VA's asset and infrastructure review. The key elements included: (1) establishing goals for the process, (2) developing criteria for evaluating closures and realignments, and (3) establishing an organizational structure to develop closure and realignment options. GAO identified key challenges that affected DOD's implementation of BRAC 2005 and the results achieved; these challenges would need to be addressed if VA is to successfully apply the process. These challenges included: (1) large, complex recommendations required sustained senior leadership's attention and a high level of coordination among many stakeholders, and (2) the large number of actions that depend on each other for successful implementation. In the April 2017 report, GAO made recommendations related to capital planning and stakeholder involvement.

{"pred": " The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has faced significant challenges in modernizing its financial management systems, which have been designated as high risk due to internal control and financial management deficiencies. To address these issues, DHS initiated a decentralized approach to upgrade or replace legacy systems, including the use of federal Shared Service Providers (SSPs). The TRIO project, involving the Coast Guard, TSA, and DNDO, aimed to migrate their financial systems to a modernized solution provided by IBC. However, the project encountered various challenges, including delays in implementation, unanticipated complexities, and issues with managing risks effectively. The TRIO components conducted alternatives analyses (AAs) to identify the best alternative for transitioning to a modernized financial management system solution, but these AAs did not fully conform to the best practices for conducting an AOA process. For example, Coast Guard and TSA's AAs did not fully meet the four characteristics of a reliable, high-quality AOA process, which are well-documented, comprehensive, unbiased, and credible. Additionally, DHS guidance did not fully incorporate five of the GAO-identified best practices for conducting an AOA process. As a result, the TRIO components faced an increased risk that the solution they chose would not represent the best alternative for meeting their mission needs. The project also experienced significant challenges, raising concerns about the extent to which objectives will be achieved as planned. Plans for DHS’s path forward on the TRIO project, as of May 2017, involve significant changes, such as transitioning away from IBC and a 2-year delay in completing Coast Guard and TSA’s migration to a modernized solution. The report highlights the importance of following best practices in analyzing alternatives and managing project risks to ensure the success of large, complex projects like the TRIO project. It also recommends that DHS improve its processes and guidance to ensure that future AAs fully follow AOA process best practices and reflect the four characteristics of a reliable, high-quality AOA process.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points. The report is about the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and their efforts to modernize financial management systems. They mention that since DHS's creation in 2003, there have been significant internal control and financial management system deficiencies that have hampered their ability to manage operations effectively. These deficiencies led to the designation of DHS's management functions, including financial management, as high risk.\n\nThe", "answers": ["To help address long-standing financial management system deficiencies, DHS initiated its TRIO project, which has focused on migrating three of its components to a modernized financial management system provided by IBC, an OMB-designated, federal SSP. House Report Number 3128 included a provision for GAO to assess the risks of DHS using IBC in connection with its modernization efforts. This report examines (1) the extent to which DHS and the TRIO components followed best practices in analyzing alternatives, and the key factors, metrics, and processes used in their choice of a modernized financial management system; (2) the extent to which DHS managed the risks of using IBC for its TRIO project consistent with risk management best practices; and (3) the key factors and challenges that have impacted the TRIO project and DHS's plans for completing remaining key priorities. GAO interviewed key officials, reviewed relevant documents, and determined whether DHS followed best practices identified by GAO as necessary characteristics of a reliable, high-quality AOA process and other risk management best practices. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) TRIO project represents a key effort to address long-standing financial management system deficiencies. During 2012 and 2013, the TRIO components—U.S. Coast Guard (Coast Guard), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO)—each completed an alternatives analysis (AA) to determine a preferred alternative for modernizing its financial management system. GAO found that DNDO's AA substantially met the four characteristics—well-documented, comprehensive, unbiased, and credible—that GAO previously identified for a reliable, high-quality analysis of alternatives (AOA) process. However, Coast Guard's and TSA's AAs did not fully or substantially meet three of these characteristics, and DHS guidance for conducting AAs did not substantially incorporate certain best practices, such as identifying significant risks and mitigation strategies and performing an independent review to help validate the AOA process. Based on these analyses and other factors, the TRIO components determined that migrating to a federal shared service provider (SSP) represented the best alternative, and in 2014, DHS selected the Department of the Interior's Interior Business Center (IBC) as the federal SSP for the project. However, because Coast Guard's and TSA's AAs did not fully or substantially reflect all of the characteristics noted above, they are at increased risk that the alternative selected may not achieve mission needs. DHS also did not fully follow best practices for managing project risks related to its use of IBC on the TRIO project. Specifically, DHS followed three of seven risk management best practices, such as determining risk sources and categories and establishing a risk management strategy. However, it did not fully follow four best practices for defining risk parameters, identifying risks, developing risk mitigation plans, and implementing these plans largely because its guidance did not sufficiently address these best practices. For example, although DHS created joint teams with IBC and provided additional resources to IBC to help address risk mitigation concerns, it did not always develop sufficiently detailed risk mitigation plans that also included contingency plans for selected critical risks. As a result, although IBC's capacity and experience for migrating large agencies the size of Coast Guard and TSA was identified as a risk in July 2014, a contingency plan working group to address this concern was not established until January 2017. By not fully following risk management best practices, DHS is at increased risk that potential problems may not be identified or properly mitigated. DHS, IBC, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and other federal oversight agencies identified various challenges that have impacted the TRIO project and contributed to a 2-year delay in the implementation of Coast Guard's and TSA's modernized solutions. These challenges include the lack of sufficient resources, aggressive schedule, complex requirements, increased costs, and project management and communication concerns. To help address these challenges, DHS and IBC established review teams and have taken other steps to assess potential mitigating steps. In May 2017, DHS determined that migrating the solution from IBC to a DHS data center represented the best option and initiated discovery efforts to further assess this as its path forward for the TRIO project. GAO recommends that DHS more fully follow best practices for conducting an AOA process and managing risks. DHS concurred with GAO's recommendations and described actions it will take, or has taken, in response."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10649}
{"pred": " The report discusses the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), a U.S. law aimed at combating tax evasion by requiring foreign financial institutions (FFIs) to report information about U.S. persons' foreign financial assets. The law mandates that FFIs report detailed information annually about their U.S. customers, which is crucial for efforts to combat tax evasion by U.S. persons holding investments in offshore accounts. The report highlights the importance of FATCA in improving visibility into taxable income from foreign sources and enhancing the agency’s ability to identify and pursue taxpayer noncompliance. It also discusses the challenges faced by IRS in collecting and managing data from FFIs, particularly the lack of accurate Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TINs), which hinders the ability to match information reported by FFIs to individual taxpayers. The report also examines the extent to which the Department of the Treasury administers overlapping reporting requirements on foreign financial assets, and the challenges faced by IRS in collecting and managing data from FFIs. The report further explores the differences between FATCA and the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) reporting requirements, and the effects of FATCA implementation that are unique to U.S. persons living abroad. The report concludes that while FATCA has been successful in reducing tax evasion, the IRS must address key challenges to fully leverage the information for compliance efforts. The report also recommends that Congress consider amending the Internal Revenue Code, Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, and other statutes to address overlap in foreign financial asset reporting requirements for the purposes of tax compliance and detection, and prevention of financial crimes. The report includes recommendations for the IRS to develop a plan to mitigate risks with compliance activities due to the lack of accurate and complete TINs of U.S. account holders collected from FFIs, ensure appropriate business units conducting compliance enforcement and research have access to consistent and complete data collected from individuals' electronic and paper filings of Form 8938 and elements of parent individual tax returns, employ a comprehensive plan for managing efforts to leverage FATCA data in agency compliance efforts, and assess factors contributing to unnecessary Form 8938 reporting and take appropriate steps to address the issue. The report also recommends that the Secretary of the Treasury, in coordination with the Secretary of State and the Commissioner of Social Security, establish a formal means to collaboratively address ongoing issues that U.S. persons living abroad encounter from the implementation of FATCA reporting requirements. The report concludes that while FATCA has been successful in reducing tax evasion, the IRS must address key challenges", "answers": ["Concerns over efforts by U.S. taxpayers to use offshore accounts to hide income or evade taxes contributed to the passage of FATCA in 2010, which sought to create greater transparency and accountability over offshore assets held by U.S. taxpayers. House Report 114-624 included a provision for GAO to evaluate FATCA implementation and determine the effects of FATCA on U.S. citizens living abroad. GAO—among other things—(1) assessed IRS's efforts to use FATCA-related information to improve taxpayer compliance; (2) examined the extent to which Treasury administers overlapping reporting requirements on financial assets held overseas; and (3) examined the effects of FATCA implementation unique to U.S. persons living abroad. GAO reviewed applicable documentation; analyzed tax data; and interviewed officials from IRS, other federal agencies and organizations, selected tax practitioners, and more than 20 U.S. persons living overseas. Data quality and management issues have limited the effectiveness of the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) efforts to improve taxpayer compliance using foreign financial asset data collected under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). Specifically, IRS has had difficulties matching the information reported by foreign financial institutions (FFI) with U.S. taxpayers' tax filings due to missing or inaccurate Taxpayer Identification Numbers provided by FFIs. Further, IRS lacks access to consistent and complete data on foreign financial assets and other data reported in tax filings by U.S. persons, in part, because some IRS databases do not store foreign asset data reported from paper filings. IRS has also stopped pursuing a comprehensive plan to leverage FATCA data to improve taxpayer compliance because, according to IRS officials, IRS moved away from updating broad strategy documents to focus on individual compliance campaigns. Ensuring access to consistent and complete data collected from U.S. persons—and employing a plan to leverage such data—would help IRS better leverage such campaigns and increase taxpayer compliance. Due to overlapping statutory reporting requirements, IRS and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)—both within the Department of the Treasury (Treasury)—collect duplicative foreign financial account and other asset information from U.S. persons. Consequently, in tax years 2015 and 2016, close to 75 percent of U.S. persons who reported information on foreign accounts and other assets on their tax returns also filed a separate form with FinCEN. The overlapping requirements increase the compliance burden on U.S. persons and add complexity that can create confusion, potentially resulting in inaccurate or unnecessary reporting. Modifying the statutes governing the requirements to allow for the sharing of FATCA information for the prevention and detection of financial crimes would eliminate the need for duplicative reporting. This is similar to other statutory allowances for IRS to disclose return information for other purposes, such as for determining Social Security income tax withholding. According to documents GAO reviewed, and focus groups and interviews GAO conducted, FFIs closed some U.S. persons' existing accounts or denied them opportunities to open new accounts after FATCA was enacted due to increased costs, and risks they pose under FATCA reporting requirements. According to Department of State (State) data, annual approvals of renunciations of U.S. citizenship increased from 1,601 to 4,449—or nearly 178 percent—from 2011 through 2016, attributable in part to the difficulties cited above. Treasury previously established joint strategies with State to address challenges U.S. persons faced in accessing foreign financial services. However, it lacks a collaborative mechanism to coordinate efforts with other agencies to address ongoing challenges in accessing such services or obtaining Social Security Numbers. Implementation of a formal means to collaboratively address burdens faced by Americans abroad from FATCA can help federal agencies develop more effective solutions to mitigate such burdens by monitoring and sharing information on such issues, and jointly developing and implementing steps to address them. GAO is making one matter for congressional consideration to address overlap in foreign asset reporting requirements. GAO is making seven recommendations to IRS and other agencies to enhance IRS's ability to leverage FATCA data to enforce compliance, address unnecessary reporting, and better collaborate to mitigate burdens on U.S. persons living abroad.

It highlights the significant amount of discretionary budget authority appropriated for these purposes, with approximately $2 trillion allocated since FY2001. This includes $1.8 trillion for the Department of Defense (DOD), $154 billion for the Department of State and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and $3 billion for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Coast Guard. The report discusses the historical context of such funding, including the use of supplemental appropriations for war-related activities and the evolution of the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) designation. It also examines the debate over the appropriate use of OCO funding, including whether it should be used for unforeseen needs or for activities that could be covered in regular appropriations. The report notes that OCO funding has been used for a wide range of activities, including those unrelated to war, such as the European Deterrence Initiative and other base-budget requirements. The report also discusses the impact of the Budget Control Act (BCA) on discretionary spending, including the use of OCO funding to circumvent the BCA's spending caps.

The report", "answers": ["Congressional interest in Overseas Contingency Operation (OCO) funding has continued as Members debate ways of funding priorities without breaching discretionary spending limits set in law. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress has appropriated approximately $2 trillion in discretionary budget authority designated as emergency requirements or for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism (OCO/GWOT) in support of the broad U.S. government response to the 9/11 attacks and for other related international affairs activities. This figure amounts to approximately 9.4% of total discretionary spending during this period. Congress has used supplemental appropriation acts or designated funding for emergency requirements or OCO/GWOT—or both—in statute. These funds are not subject to limits on discretionary spending in congressional budget resolutions or to the statutory discretionary spending limits established by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-125). The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA; P.L. 99-177) allows emergency funding to be excluded from budget control limits. The BCA added the OCO/GWOT designation to the BBEDCA exemption, thereby providing Congress and the President with an alternate way to exclude funding from the BCA spending limits. While there is no overall statutory limit on the amount of emergency or OCO/GWOT spending, both Congress and the President have fundamental roles in determining how much of the spending to provide each fiscal year. Congress must designate any such funding in statute on an account-by-account basis. The President is also required to designate it as such after it is appropriated to be available for expenditure. Debate over what should constitute OCO/GWOT or emergency activities and expenses has shifted over time, reflecting differing viewpoints about the extent, nature, and duration of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere. Funding designated for OCO/GWOT has also been used to fund base-budget requirements of the DOD and State Department and to prevent or respond to crises abroad, including armed conflict, as well as human-caused and natural disasters. Some defense officials and policymakers argue OCO funding allows for flexible response to contingencies, and provides a \"safety valve\" to the spending caps and threat of sequestration—the automatic cancellation of budget authority largely through across-the-board reductions of nonexempt programs and activities—under the BCA. Critics, however, have described OCO/GWOT as a loophole or \"gimmick\"—morphing from an account for replacing combat losses of equipment, resupplying expended munitions, and transporting troops through war zones, to a \"slush fund\" for activities unrelated to contingency operations. Congress appropriated approximately $103 billion for OCO in FY2017 (8.5% of all discretionary appropriations), $78 billion for OCO in FY2018 (5.5% of all discretionary appropriations), and $68.8 billion for OCO so far in FY2019. Discretionary appropriations for FY2019 are not yet final; a continuing resolution expired December 21, 2018. Following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123), which raised discretionary budget caps for defense and foreign affairs agencies in FY2018 and FY2019, the Administration proposed shifting some OCO funding into the base, or regular, budget. Although Congress has generally not followed Administration requests for reduced funding for foreign affairs and domestic activities and has increased funding for defense, the President has asked cabinet secretaries to propose spending cuts of 5% in FY2020. Such proposals, if requested in a budget submission, may create difficult choices for Congress in FY2020 and FY2021—the final two years of the BCA discretionary spending limits.

The report is about the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the conflict minerals disclosure rule under the SEC. \n\nFirst, the DRC is a large country with a significant population, rich in minerals. It has a history of political instability and conflict, especially in the east. The report mentions the \"Africa's World War\" from 1998 to 2003, which caused a lot of deaths. There's ongoing violence, including sexual violence by armed groups and the military. \n\nThen there's the part about the Dodd-Frank Act and the conflict minerals. The four minerals are tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold. The SEC has a rule requiring companies to disclose if their products use these minerals from the DRC or covered countries. The rule involves steps like determining if the minerals are necessary, conducting a country-of-origin inquiry, and exercising due diligence. \n\nThe report also discusses the 2017 SEC disclosure rule, the number of companies that filed, and the challenges they faced in determining the origin of the minerals. It mentions that most companies used a due diligence framework, like the OECD's, and that some companies declared their products as \"DRC conflict free\" with an independent audit. \n\nThere's also information about sexual violence in the DRC and neighboring countries. The report includes data from surveys in Uganda and Burundi, as well as case-file data from the UN and State Department. It notes that sexual violence remains a significant issue, with many cases reported in the DRC, especially in North Kivu and Kasai regions. \n\nThe report also references previous GAO reports on the same topic, showing a pattern of challenges in determining the source of conflict minerals and the ongoing issues with sexual violence. \n\nNow, I need to condense all this into a one-page summary. I should start by introducing the DRC and its context, then move on to the conflict minerals disclosure rule, the companies' disclosures in 2017, the challenges faced, and the sexual violence data. I need to make sure the summary is concise, covers all key points, and is structured logically. Also, I should avoid any technical jargon and keep the language clear and straightforward. Let me check if I missed any important details.

In the eastern DRC, armed groups have committed severe human rights abuses, including sexual violence, and reportedly profit from the exploitation of “conflict minerals”— in particular, tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold, according to the United Nations. Congress included a provision in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that, among other things, required the SEC to promulgate regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals from the DRC and adjoining countries. The SEC adopted these regulations in 2012. The act also included a provision for GAO to annually assess the SEC regulations' effectiveness in promoting peace and security and report on the rate of sexual violence in the DRC and adjoining countries. In this report, GAO provides information about (1) companies' conflict minerals disclosures filed with the SEC in 2017 compared with disclosures filed in the prior 2 years and (2) the rate of sexual violence in the eastern DRC and adjoining countries published in 2017 and early 2018. GAO analyzed a generalizable random sample of SEC filings and interviewed relevant officials. GAO reviewed U.S., United Nations, and international organizations' reports; interviewed DRC officials, and other stakeholders; and conducted fieldwork in New York at the United Nations headquarters. GAO is not making any recommendations. GAO's review of companies' conflict minerals disclosures filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2017 found that, in general, they were similar to disclosures filed in the prior 2 years. In 2017, 1,165 companies filed conflict minerals disclosures—about the same as in 2016 and 2015. Percentages of companies reporting country-of-origin inquiries in 2017 were also similar to the percentages from those 2 prior years. As a result of the inquiries they conducted, an estimated 53 percent of companies reported in 2017 whether the conflict minerals in their products came from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries—similar to the estimated 49 percent in 2016 and 2015 but significantly higher than the estimate of 30 percent in 2014 (see figure). In their 2017 disclosure reports, many companies described actions they took to improve data collection processes, and most companies indicated some challenges in determining the country of origin. Similar to the prior 2 years, almost all companies required to conduct due diligence, as a result of their country-of-origin inquiries, reported doing so. After conducting due diligence to determine the source and chain of custody of any conflict minerals used, an estimated 37 percent of these companies reported in 2017 that they were able to determine that their conflict minerals came from covered countries or from scrap or recycled sources, compared with 39 and 23 percent in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Four companies in GAO's sample declared their products “DRC conflict-free,” and of those, three included the required Independent Private Sector Audit report (IPSA), and one did not. In 2017, 16 companies filed an IPSA; 19 did so in 2016. GAO found information on the rate of sexual violence in the 2017 Uganda and Burundi Demographic and Health Surveys.

{"pred": " The report provides an overview of the U.S. nonimmigrant visa (NIV) adjudication process, highlighting the roles of various government agencies, the types of NIVs, and the factors influencing visa issuance and refusal. Key points include:\n\n1. **Adjudication Process**: The Department of State (State) is primarily responsible for adjudicating NIV applications, managing the consular officer corps, and overseeing more than 220 visa-issuing posts globally. The process varies in duration, from a single day to months, depending on the visa type, applicant background, and demand.\n\n2. **Visa Types and Categories**: NIVs are categorized into seven groups, with the majority being tourist and business visitor visas. Other categories include student and exchange visitor visas, temporary worker visas, transit and crewmember visas, foreign official and employee visas, and fiancé(e) and spouse visas. The validity period and number of entries vary based on the specific visa and reciprocity arrangements with the applicant's country of nationality.\n\n3. **Screening and Vetting**: The process involves multiple steps, including background checks by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on petitioners and beneficiaries. USCIS conducts checks against the TECS database, which includes enforcement, inspection, and operational records. For certain visas, such as the K-1 visa, an FBI fingerprint check may be required of the U.S. citizen petitioner. If the background checks identify a potential match to derogatory information, the background check unit at the USCIS service center that received the petition is to conduct further research to confirm the match, such as running checks against other government systems and collaborating with other government agencies. If all background check hits have been resolved and documented, and there is no reason not to proceed, USCIS will adjudicate the petition.\n\n4. **Refusal Rates and Reasons**: The refusal rate for NIVs increased from about 14 percent in fiscal year 2012 to about 22 percent in fiscal year 2016, and remained about the same in fiscal year 2017. The majority of refusals were due to the applicant's inability to overcome the presumption of intent to immigrate or meet the visa's eligibility criteria. Other reasons included inadequate documentation, which could be resolved by providing additional information.\n\n5. **Executive Actions and Legal Challenges**: The report discusses the executive actions taken by the President, including Executive Orders 13769 and 1", "answers": ["Previous attempted and successful terrorist attacks against the United States have raised questions about the security of the U.S. government's process for adjudicating NIVs, which are issued to foreign nationals, such as tourists, business visitors, and students, seeking temporary admission into the United States. For example, the December 2015 shootings in San Bernardino, California, led to concerns about NIV screening and vetting processes because one of the attackers was admitted into the United States under a NIV. In 2017, the President issued executive actions directing agencies to improve visa screening and vetting, and establishing nationality-based visa entry restrictions, which the Supreme Court upheld in June 2018. GAO was asked to review NIV screening and vetting. This report examines (1) outcomes and characteristics of adjudicated NIV applications from fiscal years 2012 through 2017, and (2) key changes made to the NIV adjudication process in response to executive actions taken in 2017. GAO analyzed State NIV adjudication data for fiscal years 2012 through 2017, the most recent and complete data available. GAO visited seven consular posts selected based on visa workload and other factors. GAO reviewed relevant executive orders and proclamations, and documents related to implementing these actions. This is a public version of a sensitive report issued in June 2018. Information that DHS, State, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence deemed sensitive has been removed. The total number of nonimmigrant visa (NIV) applications that Department of State (State) consular officers adjudicated annually peaked at about 13.4 million in fiscal year 2016, and decreased by about 880,000 adjudications in fiscal year 2017. NIV adjudications varied by visa group, country of nationality, and refusal reason: Visa group. From fiscal years 2012 through 2017, about 80 percent of NIV adjudications were for tourists and business visitors. During this time, adjudications for temporary workers increased by about 50 percent and decreased for students and exchange visitors by about 2 percent. Country of nationality. In fiscal year 2017, more than half of all NIV adjudications were for applicants of six countries of nationality: China (2.02 million, or 16 percent), Mexico (1.75 million, or 14 percent), India (1.28 million, or 10 percent), Brazil (670,000, or 5 percent), Colombia (460,000, or 4 percent), and Argentina (370,000, or 3 percent). Refusal reason. State data indicate that over this time period, 18 percent of adjudicated applications were refused; more than 90 percent were because the applicant did not qualify for the visa sought, and a small percentage (0.05 percent) were due to terrorism and security-related concerns. In 2017, two executive orders and a proclamation issued by the President required, among other actions, visa entry restrictions for nationals of certain listed countries of concern, the development of uniform baseline screening and vetting standards, and changes to NIV screening and vetting procedures. GAO's analysis of State data indicates that, out of the nearly 2.8 million NIV applications refused in fiscal year 2017, 1,338 applications were refused due to visa entry restrictions implemented per the executive actions. State, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and others developed standards for screening and vetting by the U.S. government for all immigration benefits, such as for the requirement for applicants to undergo certain security checks. Further, State sought and received emergency approval from the Office of Management and Budget in May 2017 to develop a new form to collect additional information from some visa applicants, such as email addresses and social media handles."], "all_classes": null, "length": 11506}
{"pred": " The report discusses the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) approach to collecting broadband availability data and its implications for broadband access on tribal lands. The FCC uses Form 477, a twice-yearly form, to collect data on broadband availability from providers. However, the report highlights several limitations in the FCC's current process for collecting broadband data that lead to overstatements of broadband access on tribal lands. Specifically, the FCC's method of collecting mobile and fixed broadband data from providers (the Form 477) does not accurately or completely capture broadband access on tribal lands because it (1) captures nationwide broadband availability data—areas where providers may have broadband infrastructure—but does so in a way that leads to overstatements of availability, and (2) does not capture information on factors that FCC and tribal stakeholders have stated can affect broadband access on tribal lands, such as affordability, service quality, and denials of service. The report also discusses the lack of a formal process for obtaining tribal input on the accuracy of provider-submitted broadband data for tribal lands. The FCC's current process for collecting broadband data does not adequately capture the ability of Americans living on tribal lands to access broadband Internet services. The report concludes that the FCC's approach to collecting broadband data leads to overstatements of broadband access on tribal lands, which may affect the ability of tribes to access federal funding and to make informed decisions about broadband deployment. The report recommends that the FCC develop and implement methods for collecting and reporting accurate and complete broadband data specific to tribal lands, develop a formal process for obtaining tribal input on the accuracy of provider-submitted broadband data, and obtain feedback from tribal stakeholders and providers on the effectiveness of the FCC's 2012 tribal engagement statement to determine whether the agency needs to clarify its tribal engagement statement.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report. Let me start by understanding the key points. The report is about the FCC's methods for collecting broadband data and how these methods affect the accuracy of broadband access on tribal lands. \n\nFirst, the FCC uses Form 477, which providers fill out twice a year. This form collects data on broadband availability, but there are issues. For example, the FCC's method of collecting mobile broadband data doesn't accurately capture broadband access on tribal lands. They mention that the data might overstate availability because they consider areas where providers have infrastructure, even if it's not accessible to everyone. Also, the data don't account for factors like affordability, service quality, and denials of service,", "answers": ["Broadband furthers economic development, educational attainment, and public health and safety; however, residents of tribal lands have lower levels of broadband access relative to the U.S. population. Congress has prioritized identifying and targeting funds to unserved areas. FCC uses data from broadband providers to develop maps and reports depicting broadband availability in the United States, with specific information on tribal lands. GAO was asked to review FCC's efforts to collect broadband data for tribal lands. This report examines the extent to which: (1) FCC's approach to collecting broadband data accurately captures broadband access on tribal lands and (2) FCC obtains tribal input on the data. GAO interviewed stakeholders from 25 tribal governments or tribally owned providers, and visited nine tribal lands. The selected tribes varied geographically and in levels of broadband availability, among other characteristics. GAO also reviewed FCC's rulemakings on broadband data and interviewed other tribal stakeholders, FCC officials, and 13 non-tribal broadband providers selected to include a diversity of technologies. Provider and tribal interviews were based on non-generalizable samples. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) collects data on broadband availability from providers, but these data do not accurately or completely capture broadband access on tribal lands. Specifically, FCC collects data on broadband availability; these data capture where providers may have broadband infrastructure. However, FCC considers broadband to be “available” for an entire census block if the provider could serve at least one location in the census block. This leads to overstatements of service for specific locations like tribal lands (see figure). FCC, tribal stakeholders, and providers have noted that this approach leads to overstatements of broadband availability. Because FCC uses these data to measure broadband access, it also overstates broadband access—the ability to obtain service—on tribal lands. Additionally, FCC does not collect information on several factors—such as affordability, quality, and denials of service—that FCC and tribal stakeholders stated can affect the extent to which Americans living on tribal lands can access broadband services. FCC provides broadband funding for unserved areas based on its broadband data. Overstatements of access limit FCC's and tribal stakeholders' abilities to target broadband funding to such areas. For example, some tribal officials stated that inaccurate data have affected their ability to plan their own broadband networks and obtain funding to address broadband gaps on their lands. By developing and implementing methods for collecting and reporting accurate and complete data on broadband access specific to tribal lands, FCC would be better able to target federal broadband funding to tribal areas that need it the most and to more accurately assess FCC's progress toward its goal of increasing all Americans' access to affordable broadband. FCC does not have a formal process to obtain tribal input on the accuracy of provider-submitted broadband data. In the National Broadband Plan , FCC highlighted the need for a targeted approach to improve broadband availability data for tribal lands. As outlined in the plan, such an approach would include working with tribes to ensure that information is accurate and useful. About half of the tribal stakeholders GAO interviewed raised concerns that FCC relies solely on data from providers, and most stated FCC should work with tribes to improve the accuracy of FCC's data. Establishing a formal process to obtain input from tribal governments on the accuracy of provider-submitted broadband data could help improve the accuracy of FCC's broadband data for tribal lands. GAO is making three recommendations to FCC, including that it collect and report data that accurately measure tribal broadband access as well as develop a process to obtain tribal input on the accuracy of the data.

It also evaluates the efforts by federal regulators to reduce these burdens. The report identifies three sets of regulations as most burdensome: (1) data reporting requirements related to loan applicants and loan terms under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA); (2) transaction reporting and customer due diligence requirements as part of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and related anti-money laundering (AML) laws; and (3) disclosures of mortgage fees and terms to consumers under the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure (TRID) regulations. These regulations are complex and time-consuming to comply with, leading to increased compliance costs for community banks and credit unions. The report also discusses the benefits of these regulations, such as promoting fair lending practices and protecting consumers from predatory lending. The federal regulators have taken several actions to reduce the regulatory burden on community banks and credit unions, including revising regulations, providing exemptions, and issuing guidance. The report also highlights the limitations of the current regulatory review process, such as the lack of quantitative analysis and the failure to consider the cumulative effect of regulations on institutions. The report concludes that while some regulations are burdensome, they also provide significant benefits, and that the efforts by federal regulators to reduce these burdens are ongoing. The report makes 10 recommendations to the federal regulators, including the CFPB, to further reduce the regulatory burden on community banks and credit unions.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report. Let me start by understanding the key points the report is making. The report discusses the regulatory burden on community banks and credit unions, identifies the most burdensome regulations, and evaluates the efforts by federal regulators to reduce these burdens.\n\nFirst, the report defines community banks as smaller institutions that provide banking services to the local community, with management and board members residing in the community. It mentions that while there's no universally accepted definition, many banks have assets well below $10 billion, with about 90% having assets under $1.2 billion as of March 2016. \n\nThe report then goes into detail about the three most burdensome regulations: HMDA, BSA/AML, and TRID. Each of these regulations is complex, leading to increased compliance costs for community banks and credit unions. The report also highlights the benefits of these regulations, such as promoting fair lending practices and protecting consumers from predatory", "answers": ["In recent decades, many new regulations intended to strengthen financial soundness, improve consumer protections, and aid anti-money laundering efforts were implemented for financial institutions. Smaller community banks and credit unions must comply with some of the regulations, but compliance can be more challenging and costly for these institutions. GAO examined (1) the regulations community banks and credit unions viewed as most burdensome and why, and (2) efforts by depository institution regulators to reduce any regulatory burden. GAO analyzed regulations and interviewed more than 60 community banks and credit unions (selected based on asset size and financial activities), regulators, and industry associations and consumer groups. GAO also analyzed letters and transcripts commenting on regulatory burden that regulators prepared responding to the comments. Interviews and focus groups GAO conducted with representatives of over 60 community banks and credit unions indicated regulations for reporting mortgage characteristics, reviewing transactions for potentially illicit activity, and disclosing mortgage terms and costs to consumers were the most burdensome. Institution representatives said these regulations were time-consuming and costly to comply with, in part because the requirements were complex, required individual reports that had to be reviewed for accuracy, or mandated actions within specific timeframes. However, regulators and others noted that the regulations were essential to preventing lending discrimination and use of the banking system for illicit activity, and they were acting to reduce compliance burdens. Institution representatives also said that the new mortgage disclosure regulations increased compliance costs, added significant time to loan closings, and resulted in institutions absorbing costs when others, such as appraisers and inspectors, changed disclosed fees. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued guidance and conducted other outreach to educate institutions after issuing these regulations in 2013. But GAO found that some compliance burdens arose from misunderstanding the disclosure regulations—which in turn may have led institutions to take actions not actually required. Assessing the effectiveness of the guidance for the disclosure regulations could help mitigate the misunderstandings and thus also reduce compliance burdens. Regulators of community banks and credit unions—the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the National Credit Union Administration—conduct decennial reviews to obtain industry comments on regulatory burden. But the reviews, conducted under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 (EGRPRA), had the following limitations: CFPB and the consumer financial regulations for which it is responsible were not included. Unlike executive branch agencies, the depository institution regulators are not required to analyze and report quantitative-based rationales for their responses to comments. Regulators do not assess the cumulative burden of the regulations they administer. CFPB has formed an internal group that will be tasked with reviewing regulations it administers, but the agency has not publicly announced the scope of regulations included, the timing and frequency of the reviews, and the extent to which they will be coordinated with the other federal banking and credit union regulators as part of their periodic EGRPRA reviews. Congressional intent in mandating that these regulators review their regulations was that the cumulative effect of all federal financial regulations be considered. In addition, sound practices required of other federal agencies require them to analyze and report their assessments when reviewing regulations. Documenting in plans how the depository institution regulators would address these EGRPRA limitations would better ensure that all regulations relevant to community banks and credit unions were reviewed, likely improve the analyses the regulators perform, and potentially result in additional burden reduction. GAO makes a total of 10 recommendations to CFPB and the depository institution regulators. CFPB should assess the effectiveness of guidance on mortgage disclosure regulations and publicly issue its plans for the scope and timing of its regulation reviews and coordinate these with the other regulators' review process. As part of their burden reviews, the depository institution regulators should develop plans to report quantitative rationales for their actions and addressing the cumulative burden of regulations. In written comments, CFPB and the four depository institution regulators generally agreed with the recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 18098}
{"pred": " The report provides an in-depth analysis of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Grants Management Modernization (GMM) program, which aims to streamline and modernize FEMA's grants management processes. The report highlights the complexity of FEMA's current grants management environment, which includes 45 active disaster and non-disaster grant programs grouped into 12 distinct categories. These programs are managed by various stakeholders, including FEMA officials, grant recipients, and external users, with the GMM program intended to replace the 10 primary legacy IT systems. The report discusses the challenges in implementing leading practices for business process reengineering and IT requirements management, including ensuring executive leadership support, assessing the current and target business environment, establishing plans for implementing new business processes, establishing clear, prioritized, and traceable IT requirements, tracking progress in delivering IT requirements, and incorporating input from end user stakeholders. The report also evaluates the reliability of GMM's estimated costs and schedule, and the extent to which FEMA is addressing key cybersecurity practices for GMM. The report concludes that while FEMA has taken positive steps in implementing leading practices for business process reengineering and IT requirements management, the program still needs to finalize plans and time frames for implementing organizational change management actions, communicate detailed transition activities, and maintain clear traceability of IT requirements to effectively deliver a modernized IT system to meet the needs of its large range of users. The report also highlights the challenges in implementing a reliable schedule to fully deliver GMM by September 2020, which is considered aggressive and unrealistic. The delays experienced by the program further compound the schedule issues. Without a robust schedule informed by a realistic assessment of GMM's development activities, leadership will be limited in its ability to make informed decisions on what additional increases in cost or reductions in scope might be needed to achieve their goals. The report also notes that FEMA's implementation of cybersecurity practices for GMM in the areas of system categorization, selection and implementation of security controls, and ongoing monitoring will help the program. However, GMM lacked essential details for evaluating security controls, did not approve the security assessment plan before proceeding with the assessment, and did not follow DHS guidance to develop corrective action plans for all security vulnerabilities. As a result, the GMM engineering and test environment remains at an increased risk of exploitation. The report makes eight recommendations to FEMA, including finalizing the organizational change management plan and time frames for implementing change management actions, planning and communicating detailed transition activities to affected customers, implementing planned changes to processes for documenting requirements for future", "answers": ["FEMA, a component of DHS, annually awards billions of dollars in grants to help communities prepare for, mitigate the effects of, and recover from major disasters. However, FEMA's complex IT environment supporting grants management consists of many disparate systems. In 2008, the agency attempted to modernize these systems but experienced significant challenges. In 2015, FEMA initiated a new endeavor (the GMM program) aimed at streamlining and modernizing the grants management IT environment. GAO was asked to review the GMM program. GAO's objectives were to (1) determine the extent to which FEMA is implementing leading practices for reengineering its grants management processes and incorporating needs into IT requirements; (2) assess the reliability of the program's estimated costs and schedule; and (3) determine the extent to which FEMA is addressing key cybersecurity practices. GAO compared program documentation to leading practices for process reengineering and requirements management, cost and schedule estimation, and cybersecurity risk management, as established by the Software Engineering Institute, National Institute of Standards and Technology, and GAO. Of six important leading practices for effective business process reengineering and information technology (IT) requirements management, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) fully implemented four and partially implemented two for the Grants Management Modernization (GMM) program (see table). Specifically, FEMA ensured senior leadership commitment, took steps to assess its business environment and performance goals, took recent actions to track progress in delivering IT requirements, and incorporated input from end user stakeholders. However, FEMA has not yet fully established plans for implementing new business processes or established complete traceability of IT requirements. Until FEMA fully implements the remaining two practices, it risks delivering an IT solution that does not fully modernize FEMA's grants management systems. While GMM's initial May 2017 cost estimate of about $251 million was generally consistent with leading practices for a reliable, high-quality estimate, it no longer reflects current assumptions about the program. FEMA officials stated in December 2018 that they had completed a revised cost estimate, but it was undergoing departmental approval. GMM's program schedule was inconsistent with leading practices; of particular concern was that the program's final delivery date of September 2020 was not informed by a realistic assessment of GMM development activities, and rather was determined by imposing an unsubstantiated delivery date. Developing sound cost and schedule estimates is necessary to ensure that FEMA has a clear understanding of program risks. Of five key cybersecurity practices, FEMA fully addressed three and partially addressed two for GMM. Specifically, it categorized GMM's system based on security risk, selected and implemented security controls, and monitored security controls on an ongoing basis. However, the program had not initially established corrective action plans for 13 medium- and low-risk vulnerabilities. This conflicts with the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) guidance that specifies that corrective action plans must be developed for every weakness identified. Until FEMA, among other things, ensures that the program consistently follows the department's guidance on preparing corrective action plans for all security vulnerabilities, GMM's system will remain at increased risk of exploits.

{"pred": " The Clean Water Act (CWA) has been a cornerstone of federal efforts to support municipal wastewater treatment plant construction and related infrastructure projects since its inception in 1956. The CWA was significantly amended in 1972, leading to the establishment of Title II grants under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments (P.L. 92-500). These grants were initially funded at 75% federal share, but this was reduced to 55% in 1981. The CWA Title II grants program was a major federal program for funding wastewater treatment plant construction, but it was eventually phased out in the 1980s as the federal government sought to reduce its role in funding such projects. The CWA Title II grants program was replaced by the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) program, which was authorized in 1987. The CWSRF program was designed to provide seed money for state-administered loans to build sewage treatment plants and, eventually, other water quality projects. The program was phased in beginning in FY1989 and entirely replaced the previous Title II program in FY1991. The intention was that states would have flexibility to set priorities and administer funding, while federal aid would end after FY1994. The CWSRF authorizations for appropriations expired in FY1994, but pressure to extend federal funding has continued, in part because, although Congress has appropriated $98 billion in CWA Title II and Title VI wastewater infrastructure assistance since 1972, funding needs remain high: According to the most recent formal estimate by EPA and states (prepared in 2016), an additional $271 billion nationwide is needed over the next 20 years for all types of projects eligible for funding under the act. Congress has continued to appropriate funds, and continued to assist states and localities in meeting wastewater infrastructure needs and complying with CWA requirements. In 1996, Congress established a parallel program under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) to help communities finance projects needed to comply with federal drinking water regulations. Funding support for drinking water occurred for several reasons. First, until the 1980s, the number of drinking water regulations was fairly small, and public water systems often did not need to make large investments in treatment technologies to meet those regulations. Second, good quality drinking water traditionally has been available to many communities at relatively low cost", "answers": ["The principal federal program to aid municipal wastewater treatment plant construction is authorized in the Clean Water Act (CWA). Established as a grant program in 1972, it now capitalizes state loan programs through the clean water state revolving loan fund (CWSRF) program. Since FY1972, appropriations have totaled $98 billion. In 1996, Congress amended the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA, P.L. 104-182) to authorize a similar state loan program for drinking water to help systems finance projects needed to comply with drinking water regulations and to protect public health. Since FY1997, appropriations for the drinking water state revolving loan fund (DWSRF) program have totaled $23 billion. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administers both SRF programs, which annually distribute funds to the states for implementation. Funding amounts are specified in the State and Tribal Assistance Grants (STAG) account of EPA annual appropriations acts. The combined appropriations for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure assistance have represented 25%-32% of total funds appropriated to EPA in recent years. Prior to CWA amendments in 1987 (P.L. 100-4), Congress provided wastewater grant funding directly to municipalities. The federal share of project costs was generally 55%; state and local governments were responsible for the remaining 45%. The 1987 amendments replaced this grant program with the SRF program. Local communities are now often responsible for 100% of project costs, rather than 45%, as they are required to repay loans to states. The greater financial burden of the act's loan program on some cities has caused some to seek continued grant funding. Although the CWSRF and DWSRF have largely functioned as loan programs, both allow the implementing state agency to provide \"additional subsidization\" under certain conditions. Since its amendments in 1996, the SDWA has authorized states to use up to 30% of their DWSRF capitalization grants to provide additional assistance, such as forgiveness of loan principal or negative interest rate loans, to help disadvantaged communities. America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 (AWIA; P.L. 115-270) increased this proportion to 35% while conditionally requiring states to use at least 6% of their capitalization grants for these purposes. Congress amended the CWA in 2014, adding similar provisions to the CWSRF program. In addition, appropriations acts in recent years have required states to use minimum percentages of their allotted SRF grants to provide additional subsidization. Final full-year appropriations were enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2019 (P.L. 116-6), on February 15, 2019. The act provided $1.694 billion for the CWSRF and $1.163 billion for the DWSRF program, nearly identical to the FY2018 appropriations. The FY0219 act provided $68 million for the WIFIA program, a $5 million increase from the FY2018 appropriation.

It finds that, in 5 out of 10 personal care product categories analyzed, women's versions sold at higher average prices than men's versions, even after controlling for factors like product size, brand, and promotional expenses. However, the report acknowledges that these price differences could be influenced by various factors, including differences in manufacturing costs and consumer preferences, making it difficult to determine the extent to which they are due to gender bias. The report also reviews studies on mortgage and small business credit markets, finding that while some studies suggest women may pay higher interest rates on average, these differences often become insignificant after controlling for other factors such as credit characteristics and shopping behaviors. The report highlights that while there are no federal laws explicitly prohibiting businesses from charging different prices for the same or similar goods and services targeted to men and women, consumer protection laws do prohibit sex discrimination in credit and real estate transactions. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and the Fair Housing Act (FHA) are key statutes that prevent discrimination based on sex in these markets. The report also discusses state and local efforts to address gender-related price differences, noting that some jurisdictions have passed laws or ordinances to prohibit businesses from charging different prices for the same or similar goods and services solely based on gender. These laws often include requirements related to promoting price transparency. The report concludes that while there are no federal laws explicitly prohibiting gender-based price differences, there are significant concerns about potential gender discrimination in credit and housing markets. However, due to the lack of comprehensive data and the complexity of the issue, it is challenging to determine the extent of these disparities. The report also notes that while some consumer groups and industry associations have received few complaints about gender-related price differences, this could be due to consumers being unaware of such disparities. The report further notes that some states and localities have implemented laws or ordinances to address these concerns, but the effectiveness of these measures is limited by the lack of resources and the difficulty in tracking relevant complaints. The report was prepared by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) and is intended to inform the public and relevant agencies about the findings and recommendations related to gender-based price differences in consumer products and services.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report discusses how consumer products, like deodorants and shaving items, are often differentiated by", "answers": ["Gender-related price differences occur when consumers are charged different prices for the same or similar goods and services because of factors related to gender. While variation in costs and consumer demand may give rise to such price differences, some policymakers have raised concerns that gender bias may also be a factor. While the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Fair Housing Act prohibit discrimination based on sex in credit and housing transactions, no federal law prohibits businesses from charging consumers different prices for the same or similar goods targeted to different genders. GAO was asked to review gender-related price differences for consumer goods and services sold in the United States. This report examines, among other things, (1) how prices compared for selected goods and services marketed to men and women, and potential reasons for any price differences; (2) what is known about price differences for men and women for products not differentiated by gender, such as mortgages; and (3) the extent to which federal agencies have identified and addressed any concerns about gender-related price differences. To examine these issues, GAO analyzed retail price data, reviewed relevant academic studies, analyzed federal consumer complaint data, and interviewed federal agency officials, industry experts, and academics. Firms differentiate many consumer products to appeal separately to men and women by slightly altering product attributes like color or scent. Products differentiated by gender may sell for different prices if men and women have different demands or willingness to pay for these product attributes. Of 10 personal care product categories (e.g., deodorants and shaving products) that GAO analyzed, average retail prices paid were significantly higher for women's products than for men's in 5 categories. In 2 categories—shaving gel and nondisposable razors—men's versions sold at a significantly higher price. One category—razor blades--had mixed results based on two price measures analyzed, and two others—disposable razors and mass-market perfumes—showed no significant gender price differences. GAO found that the target gender for a product is a significant factor contributing to price differences identified, but GAO did not have sufficient information to determine the extent to which these gender-related price differences were due to gender bias as opposed to other factors, such as different advertising costs. Though the analysis controlled for several observable product attributes, such as product size and packaging type, all underlying differences in costs and demand for products targeted to different genders could not be fully observed. Studies GAO reviewed found limited evidence of gender price differences for four products or services not differentiated by gender—mortgages, small business credit, auto purchases, and auto repairs. For example, with regard to mortgages, women as a group paid higher average mortgage rates than men, in part due to weaker credit characteristics, such as lower average income. However, after controlling for borrower credit characteristics and other factors, three studies did not find statistically significant differences in borrowing costs between men and women, while one found women paid higher rates for certain subprime loans. In addition, one study found that female borrowers defaulted less frequently than male borrowers with similar credit characteristics, and the study suggested that women may pay higher mortgage rates than men relative to their default risk. While these studies controlled for factors other than gender that could affect borrowing costs, several lacked important data on certain borrower risk characteristics, such as credit scores, which could affect analysis of gender disparities. Also, several studies analyzed small samples of subprime loans that were originated in 2005 or earlier, which limits the generalizability of the results. In their oversight of federal antidiscrimination statutes, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, Federal Trade Commission, and Department of Housing and Urban Development have identified limited consumer concerns based on gender-related pricing differences. GAO's analysis of complaint data received by the three agencies from 2012–2017 found that they had received limited consumer complaints about gender-related price differences. The agencies provide general consumer education resources on discrimination and consumer awareness.

FERC oversees approximately 2,500 dams, which account for about 8% of the total electric generating capacity in the United States. These dams are primarily managed by non-federal entities, such as private utility companies, municipalities, and state agencies, with some oversight by federal agencies like the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. FERC's approach to dam safety involves multiple layers of oversight, including inspections, engineering studies, and potential failure mode analyses. The report highlights that while FERC generally conducts inspections and collects information in line with its guidance, the approach to recording inspection data is inconsistent across its regions. This inconsistency limits the usefulness of the information for analysis. FERC uses various systems, including the Data and Management System (DAMS), the Office of Energy Projects-IT (OEP-IT) system, and spreadsheets, to record inspection data. However, the lack of standard language and procedures for recording information leads to difficulties in analyzing the data across regions. The report also notes that FERC has not conducted a portfolio-wide analysis of safety risks across its regulated dams, which could help identify and prioritize risks at a national level. Additionally, the report identifies limitations in FERC's ability to conduct a comprehensive analysis of safety risks due to the lack of standardized procedures for recording inspection data. The GAO recommends that FERC establish standard language and procedures for recording inspection data to facilitate analysis of safety deficiencies across its portfolio of regulated dams. Furthermore, the GAO suggests that FERC use information from inspections to assess safety risks across its portfolio of regulated dams to identify and prioritize safety risks at a national level. The report concludes that while FERC has implemented a multi-layered safety approach to reduce exposure to safety risks, there is room for improvement in its ability to assess and identify risks across its entire portfolio of dams. The GAO's recommendations aim to enhance FERC's oversight capabilities and ensure the safety of hydropower dams across the United States.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report. Let me start by understanding the key points. The report is from the GAO about FERC's oversight of hydropower dams. \n\nFirst, the report mentions that there are", "answers": ["In February 2017, components of California's Oroville Dam failed, leading to the evacuation of nearly 200,000 nearby residents. FERC is the federal regulator of the Oroville Dam and over 2,500 other dams associated with nonfederal hydropower projects nationwide. FERC issues and renews licenses—which can last up to 50 years—to dam operators and promotes safe dam operation by conducting safety inspections and reviewing technical engineering studies, among other actions. GAO was asked to review FERC's approach to overseeing dam safety. This report examines: (1) how FERC collects information from its dam safety inspections and the extent of its analysis, and (2) how FERC evaluates engineering studies of dam performance to analyze safety, among other objectives. GAO analyzed documentation on a non-generalizable sample of 42 dams associated with projects relicensed from fiscal years 2014 through 2017, selected based on geography and hazard classifications, among other factors. GAO also reviewed FERC regulations and documents; and interviewed FERC staff associated with the selected projects and technical consultants, selected based on the frequency and timing of their reviews. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) staff generally followed established guidance in collecting safety information from dam inspections for the dams GAO reviewed, but FERC has not used this information to analyze dam safety portfolio-wide. For these 42 dams, GAO found that FERC staff generally followed guidance in collecting safety information during inspections of individual dams and key structures associated with those dams. (See figure.) However, FERC lacks standard procedures that specify how and where staff should record safety deficiencies identified. As a result, FERC staff use multiple systems to record inspection findings, thereby creating information that cannot be easily analyzed. Further, while FERC officials said inspections help oversee individual dam's safety, FERC has not analyzed this information to identify any safety risks across its portfolio. GAO's prior work has highlighted the importance of evaluating risks across a portfolio. FERC officials stated that they have not conducted portfolio-wide analyses because officials prioritize the individual dam inspections and response to urgent dam safety incidents. However, following the Oroville incident, a FERC-led initiative to examine dam structures comparable to those at Oroville identified 27 dam spillways with varying degrees of safety concerns, on which FERC officials stated they are working with dam licensees to address. A similar and proactive portfolio-wide approach, based on analysis of common inspection deficiencies across the portfolio of dams under FERC's authority, could help FERC identify safety risks prior to a safety incident. Guidelines recognize that each dam is unique and allow for flexibility and exemptions in its use. FERC staff use the studies to inform other components of their safety approach, including the analysis of dam failure scenarios and their review of safety to determine whether to renew a license. GAO recommends that FERC: (1) develop standard procedures for recording information collected as part of its inspections, and (2) use inspection information to assess safety risks across FERC's portfolio of dams. FERC agreed with GAO's recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8621}

The best known programs, which serve the largest number of children, are the school meals programs: the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and the School Breakfast Program (SBP). The child nutrition programs also include the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), which provides meals and snacks in day care and after school settings; the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP), which provides food during the summer months; the Special Milk Program (SMP), which supports milk for schools that do not participate in NSLP or SBP; and the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP), which funds fruit and vegetable snacks in select elementary schools. Funding: The vast majority of the child nutrition programs account is considered mandatory spending, with trace amounts of discretionary funding for certain related activities. Referred to as open-ended, \"appropriated entitlements,\" funding is provided through the annual appropriations process; however, the level of spending is controlled by benefit and eligibility criteria in federal law and dependent on the resulting levels of participation. Federal cash funding (in the form of per-meal reimbursements) and USDA commodity food support is guaranteed to schools and other providers based on the number of meals or snacks served and participant category (e.g., free meals for poor children get higher subsidies). Participation: The child nutrition programs serve children of varying ages and in different institutional settings. The NSLP and SBP have the broadest reach, serving qualifying children of all ages in school settings. Other child nutrition programs serve more-narrow populations. CACFP, for example, provides meals and snacks to children in early childhood and after-school settings among other venues. Programs generally provide some subsidy for all food served but a larger federal reimbursement for food served to children from low-income households. Administration: Responsibility for child nutrition programs is divided between the federal government, states, and localities. The state agency and type of local provider differs by program. In the NSLP and SBP, schools and school districts (\"school food authorities\") administer the program. Meanwhile, SFSP (and sometimes CACFP) uses a model in which sponsor organizations handle administrative responsibilities for a number of sites that serve meals. Reauthorization: The underlying laws covering the child nutrition programs were last reauthorized in the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA, P.L. 111-296, enacted December 13, 2010). This law made significant changes to child nutrition programs, including increasing federal financing for school lunches, expanding access to community eligibility and direct certification options for schools, and expanding eligibility options for home child care providers. The law also required an update to school meal nutrition guidelines as well as new guidelines for food served outside the meal programs (e.g., snacks sold in vending machines and cafeteria a la carte lines). Current Issues: The 114th Congress began but did not complete a 2016 child nutrition reauthorization, and there was no significant legislative activity with regard to reauthorization in the 115th Congress. However, the vast majority of operations and activities continue with funding provided by appropriations laws.

{"pred": " (One page, 500 words)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report explains that the federal government provides benefits to coal miners affected by black lung disease (CWP) and other lung diseases when the responsible mine operators can't pay. These benefits are funded by the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, which gets its main revenue from an excise tax on coal. The tax rates have decreased over time, which is causing financial strain on the trust fund. The report also discusses the history of the trust fund, the reasons for the excise tax, and various policy options to improve its fiscal outlook.\n\nFirst, I should outline the main sections of the report.

Let me start drafting the summary now.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of the report. Let me start by identifying the key points and structure. The report discusses the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, its funding sources, financial challenges, and policy options. Here's how I can structure the summary:\n\n1. **Introduction to the Black Lung Program**: Explain the purpose of the program, which is to provide benefits to coal miners affected by CWP and other lung diseases when the responsible mine operators can't pay. Mention that the trust fund is funded by an excise tax on coal.\n\n2. **Trust Fund Revenue and", "answers": ["The federal government pays benefits to coal miners affected by coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP, commonly referred to as black lung disease) and other lung diseases linked to coal mining in cases where responsible mine operators are not able to pay. In 2019, the monthly benefit for a miner with no dependents is $660.10. Benefits can be as much as $1,320.10 per month for miners with three or more dependents. Medical benefits are provided separately from disability benefits. Benefit payments and related administrative expenses in cases in which the responsible operators do not pay are paid out of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. The primary source of revenue for the trust fund is an excise tax on coal produced and sold domestically. If excise tax revenue is not sufficient to finance Black Lung Program benefits, the trust fund may borrow from the general fund of the Treasury. For 2018, the tax rates on coal were $1.10 per ton of underground-mined coal or $0.55 per ton of surface-mined coal, limited to 4.4% of the sales price. These rates were established in 1986. Starting in 2019, under current law, these tax rates are $0.50 per ton of underground-mined coal or $0.25 per ton of surface-mined coal, limited to 2% of the sales price. These are the rates that were set when the trust fund was established in 1977. The decline in the excise tax rates will likely put additional financial strain on a trust fund that already borrows from the general fund to meet obligations. The decline in domestic coal production, recent increases in the rate of CWP, and bankruptcies in the coal sector also contribute to the financial strain on the trust fund. The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund and associated excise tax on coal were established so that the coal industry, as opposed to taxpayers in general, would bear the burden associated with providing black lung benefits. Throughout its history, the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund has not raised revenues sufficient to meet obligations. As a result, at various points in time, Congress and the President have acted to increase the excise tax on coal, forgive or refinance trust fund debt, and modify black lung benefits eligibility. With the rate of the excise tax on coal reduced in 2019, the 116th Congress may again evaluate options for improving the fiscal condition of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, or other issues related to providing federal benefits to miners with black lung disease."], "all_classes": null, "length": 7218}

The effects of Hurricanes Irma and Maria will further affect Puerto Rico's ability to repay its debt, as well as its economic condition. In response to Puerto Rico's fiscal crisis, Congress passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Security Act (PROMESA) in 2016, which included a provision for GAO to review Puerto Rico's debt. This report describes the factors that contributed to Puerto Rico's financial condition and levels of debt and federal actions that could address these factors. Consistent with PROMESA, GAO focused on actions that would not increase the federal deficit. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials from the Puerto Rico and federal governments and conducted a review of relevant literature. GAO also interviewed former Puerto Rico officials and experts in Puerto Rico's economy, the municipal securities markets, and state and territorial budgeting, financial management, and debt practices, as well as officials from the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico (created by PROMESA). GAO is not making recommendations based on the federal actions identified because policymakers would need to consider challenges and tradeoffs related to implementation. The Puerto Rico government generally agreed with the factors we identified and provided additional information. GAO incorporated technical comments from SEC as appropriate. The factors that contributed to Puerto Rico's financial condition and levels of debt relate to (1) the Puerto Rico government running persistent annual deficits—where expenses exceed revenues—and (2) its use of debt to cope with deficits. Based on a literature review and interviews with current and former Puerto Rico officials, federal officials, and other relevant experts, GAO identified factors that contributed to Puerto Rico's persistent deficits: The Puerto Rico government's inadequate financial management and oversight practices. For example, the Puerto Rico government frequently overestimated the amount of revenue it would collect and Puerto Rico's agencies regularly spent more than the amounts Puerto Rico's legislature appropriated for a given fiscal year. Policy decisions by Puerto Rico's government. For example, Puerto Rico borrowed funds to balance budgets and insufficiently addressed public pension funding shortfalls. Puerto Rico's prolonged economic contraction. Examples of factors contributing to the contraction include outmigration and the resulting diminished labor force, and the high cost of importing goods and energy. Additional factors enabled Puerto Rico to use debt to finance its deficits, such as high demand for Puerto Rico debt. One cause of high demand was that under federal law, income from Puerto Rico bonds generally receives more favorable tax treatment than income from bonds issued by states and their localities. Based on an assessment of relevant literature and input from current and former Puerto Rico officials, federal officials, and other relevant experts, GAO identified three potential federal actions that may help address some of these factors. GAO also identified considerations for policymakers related to these actions. Modify the tax exempt status for Puerto Rico municipal debt. Making interest income from Puerto Rico bonds earned by investors residing outside of Puerto Rico subject to applicable state and local taxes could lower demand for Puerto Rico debt. However, reduced demand could hinder Puerto Rico's ability to borrow funds for capital investments or liquidity. Apply federal investor protection laws to Puerto Rico. Requiring Puerto Rico investment companies to disclose risks with Puerto Rico bonds and adhere to other requirements could lower demand for the bonds. However, this action could also limit Puerto Rico's ability to borrow funds. Modify the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) authority over municipal bond disclosure requirements. SEC could be allowed to require timely disclosure of materials—such as audited financial statements—associated with municipal bonds. Over the past decade, Puerto Rico often failed to provide timely audited financial statements related to its municipal bonds. Timely disclosure could help investors make informed decisions about investing in municipal bonds. However, a broad requirement could place additional burdens on all U.S. municipal issuers, such as the costs of standardizing reporting."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6356}
{"pred": " The report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) provides an in-depth analysis of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and its four principal programs: Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the health-insurance marketplaces. The report highlights the growing size and complexity of these programs, which make them particularly vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse. Medicare and Medicaid are the largest programs, with Medicare projected to reach $1.3 trillion in spending by 2026, and Medicaid expected to grow by 66 percent to over $950 billion by fiscal year 2025. The report discusses the increasing use of managed-care delivery systems in both programs, with Medicare Part C enrollment growing from 8.7 million in 2007 to 17.5 million in 2015. Medicaid has also expanded its use of managed-care plans, with over half of the states covering certain low-income adults not historically eligible for Medicaid, as authorized under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA). The report also discusses CMS's antifraud efforts, including the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control (HCFAC) program and the Medicaid Integrity Program, which are funded through appropriations. The HCFAC program was established under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 to coordinate federal, state, and local law-enforcement efforts to address health-care fraud and abuse. In fiscal year 2016, CMS received $560 million through the HCFAC program appropriations. The Medicaid Integrity Program, established by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, supports contracts to audit and identify overpayments in Medicaid claims, and provides technical assistance for states’ program-integrity efforts. According to CMS, it received $75 million every year since fiscal year 2009 through the Medicaid Integrity Program appropriations. The report also discusses the challenges associated with improper payments in Medicare and Medicaid, including the potential for fraud. Improper payments are payments that are either made in an incorrect amount (overpayments and underpayments) or those that should not be made at all. For example, CMS estimated in fiscal year 2016 that the Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) improper payment rate was 11 percent (approximately $41 billion) and the Medicaid improper payment rate was 10.5 percent (approximately $36 billion). The report outlines", "answers": ["CMS, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), provides health coverage for over 145 million Americans through its four principal programs, with annual outlays of about $1.1 trillion. GAO has designated the two largest programs, Medicare and Medicaid, as high risk partly due to their vulnerability to fraud, waste, and abuse. In fiscal year 2016, improper payment estimates for these programs totaled about $95 billion. GAO's Fraud Risk Framework and the subsequent enactment of the Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015 have called attention to the importance of federal agencies' antifraud efforts. This report examines (1) CMS's approach for managing fraud risks across its four principal programs, and (2) how CMS's efforts managing fraud risks in Medicare and Medicaid align with the Fraud Risk Framework. GAO reviewed laws and regulations and HHS and CMS documents, such as program-integrity manuals. It also interviewed CMS officials and a sample of CMS stakeholders, including state officials and contractors. GAO selected states based on fraud risk and other factors, such as geographic diversity. GAO selected contractors based on a mix of companies and geographic areas served. The approach that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has taken for managing fraud risks across its four principal programs—Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the health-insurance marketplaces—is incorporated into its broader program-integrity approach. According to CMS officials, this broader program-integrity approach can help the agency develop control activities to address multiple sources of improper payments, including fraud. As the figure below shows, CMS views fraud as part of a spectrum of actions that may result in improper payments. CMS's efforts managing fraud risks in Medicare and Medicaid partially align with GAO's 2015 A Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs (Fraud Risk Framework). This framework describes leading practices in four components: commit , assess , design and implement , and evaluate and adapt . CMS has shown commitment to combating fraud in part by establishing a dedicated entity—the Center for Program Integrity—to lead antifraud efforts. Furthermore, CMS is offering and requiring antifraud training for stakeholder groups such as providers, beneficiaries, and health-insurance plans. However, CMS does not require fraud-awareness training on a regular basis for employees, a practice that the framework identifies as a way agencies can help create a culture of integrity and compliance. Regarding the assess and design and implement components, CMS has taken steps to identify fraud risks, such as by designating specific provider types as high risk and developing associated control activities. However, it has not conducted a fraud risk assessment for Medicare or Medicaid, and has not designed and implemented a risk-based antifraud strategy. A fraud risk assessment allows managers to fully consider fraud risks to their programs, analyze their likelihood and impact, and prioritize risks. Managers can then design and implement a strategy with specific control activities to mitigate these fraud risks, as well as an appropriate evaluation approach consistent with the evaluate and adapt component. By developing a fraud risk assessment and using that assessment to create an antifraud strategy and evaluation approach, CMS could better ensure that it is addressing the full portfolio of risks and strategically targeting the most-significant fraud risks facing Medicare and Medicaid. GAO recommends that CMS (1) provide and require fraud-awareness training to its employees, (2) conduct fraud risk assessments, and (3) create an antifraud strategy for Medicare and Medicaid, including an approach for evaluation.

{"pred": " The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) administers the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program, which aims to convert public housing units into project-based Section 8 rental assistance contracts. The program was authorized in 2011 and has been expanded over the years, with a current cap of 225,000 units. RAD has two main components: one that allows public housing authorities (PHAs) to convert their public housing units into properties with long-term project-based voucher (PBV) or project-based rental assistance (PBRA) contracts, and another that converts privately owned properties with expiring subsidies under old rental assistance programs to PBV or PBRA. The goals of RAD are to preserve the affordability of federally assisted rental properties and improve their physical and financial condition. RAD conversions involve various forms of financing, including public and private sources, such as the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), which is a key source for many conversions. The program has been implemented in phases, with the unit cap gradually increasing from 60,000 in 2011 to 225,000 in 2017. As of September 2017, 689 conversions had been closed, involving 74,709 units, with 706 conversions in the process of structuring plans. The RAD program provides added flexibility for PHAs to access private and public funding sources to supplement public housing funding. These financing sources may include debt financing through public or private lenders; mortgage financing insured by FHA; PHA operating reserves; replacement housing factor funds; seller or take-back financing; deferred developer fees; equity investment generated by the availability of 4 percent and 9 percent LIHTC; or other private or philanthropic sources. PHAs may undertake conversion involving no property rehabilitation or new construction to meet certain financial goals or for future rehabilitation or new construction, as long as the PHA can demonstrate to HUD that the property does not need immediate rehabilitation and can be physically and financially maintained for the term of the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payment contract (HAP contract). The RAD program has been implemented and expanded in phases. Since its authorization, the RAD unit cap gradually increased from 60,000 units in 2011 to 225,000 units in May 2017. The RAD program is currently fully subscribed with all 225,00", "answers": ["HUD administers the Public Housing program, which provides federally assisted rental units to low-income households through PHAs. In 2010, HUD estimated its aging public housing stock had $25.6 billion in unmet capital needs. To help address these needs, the RAD program was authorized in fiscal year 2012. RAD allows PHAs to move (convert) properties in the public housing program to Section 8 rental assistance programs, and retain property ownership or transfer it to other entities. The conversion enables PHAs to access additional funding, including investor equity, generally not available for public housing properties. GAO was asked to review public housing conversions under RAD and any impact on residents. This report addresses, among other objectives, HUD's (1) assessment of conversion outcomes; (2) oversight of resident safeguards; and (3) provisions to help preserve the long-term affordability of units. GAO analyzed data on RAD conversions through fiscal year 2017; reviewed a sample of randomly selected, nongeneralizable RAD property files; and interviewed HUD officials, PHAs, developers, academics, and affected residents. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) put procedures in place to evaluate and monitor the impact of conversion of public housing properties under the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program. RAD's authorizing legislation requires HUD to assess and publish findings about the amount of private-sector leveraging. HUD uses a variety of metrics to measure conversion outcomes. But, the metric HUD uses to measure private-sector leveraging—the share of private versus public funding for construction or rehabilitation of assisted housing—has limitations. For example, HUD's leveraging ratio counts some public resources as leveraged private-sector investment and does not use final (post-completion) data. As a result, HUD's ability to accurately assess private-sector leveraging is limited. HUD does not systematically use its data systems to track effects of RAD conversions on resident households (such as changes in rent and income, or relocation) or monitor use of all resident safeguards. Rather, since 2016, HUD has required public housing agencies (PHA) or other post-conversion owners to maintain resident logs and collect such information. But the resident logs do not contain historical program information. HUD has not developed a process for systematically reviewing information from its data systems and resident logs on an ongoing basis. HUD has been developing procedures to monitor compliance with some resident safeguards—such as the right to return to a converted property—and begun a limited review of compliance with these safeguards. However, HUD has not yet developed a process for monitoring other safeguards—such as access to other housing voucher options. Federal internal control standards require agencies to use quality information to achieve objectives, and obtain and evaluate relevant and reliable data in a timely manner for use in effective monitoring. Without a comprehensive review of household information and procedures for fully monitoring all resident safeguards, HUD cannot fully assess the effects of RAD on residents. RAD authorizing legislation and the program's use agreements (contracts with property owners) contain provisions intended to help ensure the long-term availability of affordable units, but the provisions have not been tested in situations such as foreclosure. For example, use agreements between HUD and property owners specify affordability and use restrictions that according to the contract would survive a default or foreclosure. HUD officials stated that HUD intends to develop procedures to identify and respond to risks to long-term affordability, including default or foreclosure in RAD properties. However, HUD has not yet done so. According to federal internal control standards, agencies should identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving goals and objectives. Procedures that address oversight of affordability requirements would better position HUD to help ensure RAD conversions comply with program requirements, detect potential foreclosure and other risks, and take corrective actions. GAO makes five recommendations to HUD intended to improve leveraging metrics, monitoring of the use and enforcement of resident safeguards, and compliance with RAD requirements. HUD agreed with our recommendations to improve metrics and build on existing oversight."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12616}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report to understand the main points. The report is about how federal agencies acquire and manage heavy equipment. \n\nFirst, the report mentions that agencies typically acquire heavy equipment from commercial vendors or through the GSA. They can choose to purchase or lease the equipment. The term \"lease\" is used for both short-term and long-term, but agencies have different definitions. For example, the Air Force considers rentals as less than 120 days, while FWS and NPS use it for a year or less. The report also talks about the GSA's Short-Term Rental program, which started in 2013 to help agencies avoid ownership and maintenance costs for infrequently used equipment. \n\nThen there's a section about inventory management. The report states that there are no central reporting requirements for agencies' inventories of heavy equipment, but each agency must maintain inventory controls. They use agency-specific databases, and the data requirements can vary. Some agencies track utilization, like hours used, while others don't. \n\nThe report also discusses the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and how it requires agencies to consider leasing versus purchasing. There's a mention of lease-versus-purchase analyses, which are supposed to evaluate factors like usage and maintenance costs. However, the report found that these analyses were not consistently conducted or documented by the agencies reviewed, which include the Air Force, FWS, and NPS. \n\nThere's a part about the cost of heavy equipment. The report mentions that in 2016, the 20 agencies reported spending over $7.4 billion on heavy equipment, but this figure doesn't include items where acquisition cost or year wasn't reported. The Army had a lot of items without cost data. \n\nThe report also includes data on the number of heavy equipment items owned by different agencies. DOD had the most, followed by the Department of Agriculture. Other agencies had fewer items. The equipment is categorized into different types, with construction, mining, excavating, and highway maintenance being the largest category. \n\nThe report then discusses the acquisition of heavy equipment by selected agencies from 2012 to 2016.

GAO was asked to review federal agencies' management of heavy equipment. This report, among other objectives, examines: (1) the number, type, and costs of heavy equipment items that are owned by 20 federal agencies and (2) the heavy equipment that selected agencies recently acquired as well as how they decided whether to purchase or lease this equipment. GAO collected heavy equipment inventory data as of June 2017 from the 24 agencies that have chief financial officers responsible for overseeing financial management. GAO also selected three agencies (using factors such as the heavy equipment fleet's size) and reviewed their acquisitions of and guidance on heavy equipment. These agencies' practices are not generalizable to all acquisitions but provide insight into what efforts these agencies take to acquire thousands of heavy equipment items. GAO also interviewed officials at the three selected agencies. Of the 24 agencies GAO reviewed, 20 reported owning over 136,000 heavy equipment items such as cranes, backhoes, and forklifts, and spending over $7.4 billion (in 2016 dollars) to acquire this equipment. The remaining 4 agencies reported that they do not own any heavy equipment. The three selected agencies GAO reviewed in-depth—the Air Force within the Department of Defense (DOD), and the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service within the Department of the Interior (Interior)—spent about $360 million to purchase about 3,500 heavy equipment assets in calendar years 2012 through 2016 and over $5 million to lease heavy equipment from fiscal years 2012 through 2016. Officials from all three agencies stated that they consider mission needs and the availability of equipment leases when deciding whether to lease or purchase heavy equipment. Federal regulations provide that agencies should consider whether it is more economical to lease or purchase equipment when acquiring heavy equipment, and federal internal control standards require that management clearly document all transactions in a manner that allows the documentation to be readily available for examination. However, in reviewing selected leases and purchases of heavy equipment from these three agencies, GAO found that officials did not consistently conduct or document lease-versus-purchase analyses. Officials at the Air Force and Interior said that there was a lack of clarity in agency policies about when they were required to conduct and document such analyses. Without greater clarity on when lease-versus-purchase analyses should be conducted and documented, these agencies may not be spending funds on heavy equipment effectively. The Department of the Interior and the Air Force should clarify the circumstances in which lease-versus-purchases analyses for heavy equipment acquisitions are to be conducted and documented. The Departments of the Interior and Defense concurred with these recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6750}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. \n\nThe report is about the Department of Defense (DOD) workforce changes since 2001. It mentions that the military, civilian, and contractor workforces peaked around 2011 and have since decreased. Factors contributing to this change include U.S. involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan, military to civilian conversions, contractor insourcing, and growth in certain workforces like acquisition and cyber.\n\nThe report also discusses the legal framework governing DOD's workforce management, referencing specific sections of Title 10 of the United States Code. These sections outline the policies for managing the workforce, including the use of civilian employees for new functions and the cost comparison for military, civilian, and contractor services.\n\nDOD Instruction 1100.22 is mentioned as the policy for determining the workforce mix. It includes criteria for decisions and directs DOD components to conduct cost comparisons for new or expanding mission requirements and functions that could be performed by civilian employees.\n\nThe report then talks about DOD's efforts to understand the costs associated with its workforces. In 2013, they improved their methodology for estimating and comparing the full cost of work performed by military and civilian personnel and contractor support. However, there were limitations, such as the lack of guidance for certain cost elements related to overhead. The report made five recommendations, and DOD implemented one but not the others.\n\nThe Cost-Comparison Report addressed three elements and partially addressed one element concerning the accounting for the fully-burdened cost of federal civilian and service contractor personnel performing functions at selected installations. DOD concluded that neither federal civilians nor service contractors were predominately more or less expensive, with the costs being dependent upon the function being performed, location, and level of expertise. However, the results were not generalizable across the department.\n\nThe report also discusses the challenges in determining the functions performed by contractor personnel, similar to previous work on DOD's inventory of contracted services. Section 2330a of Title 10 requires an annual inventory of activities under staff augmentation contracts. The report found that the absence of a complete and accurate inventory hinders DOD's management of these services.\n\nThe report mentions that DOD officials have recognized the challenges with various taxonomies and lexicons for articulating the size and composition of the workforce. They have efforts underway to better align these for holistic total force", "answers": ["In addition to more than 2.2 million active duty and reserve personnel, DOD employs about 760,000 federal civilians and more than 560,000 contractors. In the Senate Report 114-49 accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 included a provision for DOD to issue a report (1) assessing functions performed by federal civilian and service contractor personnel, (2) accounting for the full costs of federal civilian and service contractor personnel performing these functions, (3) comparing these costs, and (4) assessing available hiring and retention authorities for federal civilians. The Senate report also included a provision for GAO to assess DOD's report, which DOD submitted to Congress in April 2017. This report examines the extent to which DOD's report addressed the prescribed congressional elements. GAO reviewed DOD's report and compared it to the prescribed elements, examined documents relevant to DOD's cost estimating and comparison methodology, and interviewed DOD officials, including those in its Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation responsible for the calculations in DOD's report. In response to Congressional direction, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a report in April 2017 comparing the costs of federal civilian and service contractor personnel at select installations. The report addressed three out of four provision elements and partially addressed one, as discussed below. DOD concluded that neither federal civilians nor service contractors were predominately more or less expensive, with costs being dependent on position, location, and level of seniority. DOD noted that it used a non-probability based sample of personnel for its report, and the results are not generalizable. An assessment of performance of functions being performed by federal civilian and service contractor personnel at six military installations, with four being in the continental United States and two being outside the continental United States. GAO believes that DOD addressed this requirement because it developed a methodology to assess performance of functions performed by federal civilians and service contractors at 17 organizations within nine geographic regions including two locations outside the continental United States. DOD used data from the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System to identify military installations with large reported numbers of federal civilians. DOD determined that personnel need to perform at least 80 percent common tasks to be able to make a comparison. An accounting of the fully-burdened, or full, cost of federal civilian and service contractor personnel performing functions at the selected installations including training, benefits, reimbursable costs, and facility overhead. GAO believes that DOD partially addressed this requirement because while it calculated the labor costs of selected federal civilian and service contractor full-time equivalents performing similar functions for organizations at government-owned facilities, it excluded certain non-labor costs from its calculations. A comparison of the costs of performance of these functions by federal civilians and service contractor personnel at the selected installations. GAO believes that DOD addressed this requirement because it compared calculated costs for selected federal civilians and service contractors performing similar functions at selected installations and included those comparisons in its report. An assessment of the flexible employment authorities for the employment and retention of federal civilian employees. GAO believes that DOD addressed this requirement because it sent questionnaires to DOD hiring officials and human resource professionals to collect information on flexible employment authorities and conducted interviews with these and human resource professionals at the same 17 organizations used for the cost comparison. Based on an analysis of the information collected, DOD's report included several conclusions regarding flexible hiring authorities and made one recommendation. GAO is not making any recommendations; however, DOD non-concurred with GAO's assessment that DOD partially addressed the element to account for the full cost of personnel.

The report highlights that while DHS has established policies and processes to manage its acquisitions, many programs are not on track to meet their goals. Of the 24 programs assessed, 10 were on track to meet their schedule and cost goals during 2017, while 14 were not. The programs not on track experienced schedule slips, cost breaches, or both, often due to new requirements, technical challenges, or external factors like the 2017 hurricane season. The report also notes that the FYHSP report to Congress does not include operations and maintenance (O&M) funding for individual programs, which leads to an incomplete picture of program affordability. The report also highlights that while DHS has taken steps to improve its acquisition management policies, there are still opportunities to strengthen these policies by incorporating lessons from past programs and ensuring that key decisions are properly documented and reviewed. The report concludes that DHS's major acquisition programs are not affordable over the next five years, with significant cost and schedule gaps identified. It recommends that the Under Secretary for Management update policies to require components to submit certification of funds when programs re-baseline, and that the Office of Program Accountability and Risk Management assess results from post-implementation reviews to improve performance across the portfolio. The report also highlights the need for the DHS to better align its major acquisition programs with the department's strategic goals and to improve communication with Congress regarding funding and program affordability. The report concludes that while DHS has made progress in strengthening its acquisition management policies, there is still a need for more disciplined practices to ensure that the department does not pursue more programs than it can afford.\nThe report evaluates the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) management of its major acquisition programs, focusing on schedule and cost goals, requirements development, testing, and resource allocation.

DHS's acquisition activities are on GAO's High Risk List, in part, because of management and funding issues. The Explanatory Statement accompanying the DHS Appropriations Act, 2015 included a provision for GAO to review DHS's major acquisitions. This report, GAO's fourth annual review, assesses the extent to which: (1) DHS's major acquisition programs are on track to meet their schedule and cost goals, and (2) DHS has taken actions to enhance its policies and processes to better reflect key practices for effectively managing a portfolio of investments. GAO reviewed 28 acquisition programs, including DHS's largest programs that were in the process of obtaining new capabilities as of April 2017, and programs GAO or DHS identified as at risk of poor outcomes. GAO assessed cost and schedule progress against baselines, assessed DHS's policies and processes against GAO's key portfolio management practices, and met with relevant DHS officials. During 2017, 10 of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) programs GAO assessed that had approved schedule and cost goals were on track to meet those goals. GAO reviewed 28 programs in total, 4 of which were new programs that GAO did not assess because they did not establish cost and schedule goals before the end of calendar year 2017 as planned. The table shows the status of the 24 programs GAO assessed. Reasons for schedule delays or cost increases included technical challenges, changes in requirements, and external factors. Recent enhancements to DHS's acquisition management, resource allocation, and requirements policies largely reflect key portfolio management practices (see table). However, DHS is in the early stages of implementing these policies. GAO identified two areas where DHS could strengthen its portfolio management policies and implementation efforts: DHS's policies do not reflect the key practice to reassess a program that breaches—or exceeds—its cost, schedule, or performance goals in the context of the portfolio to ensure it is still relevant or affordable. Acquisition management officials said that, in practice, they do so based on a certification of funds memorandum—a tool GAO has found to be effective for DHS leadership to assess program affordability—submitted by the component when one of its programs re-baselines in response to a breach. Documenting this practice in policy would help ensure DHS makes strategic investment decisions within its limited budget. DHS is not leveraging information gathered from reviews once programs complete implementation to manage its portfolio of active acquisition programs. DHS's acquisition policy requires programs to conduct post-implementation reviews after initial capabilities are deployed, which is in line with GAO's key practices. Acquisition management officials said they do not consider the results of these reviews in managing DHS's portfolio because the reviews are typically conducted after oversight for a program shifts to the components. Leveraging these results across DHS could enable DHS to address potential issues that may contribute to poor outcomes, such as schedule slips and cost growth, for other programs in its acquisition portfolio. GAO recommends DHS update its acquisition policy to require certification of fund memorandums when programs re-baseline as a result of a breach and assess programs' post-implementation reviews to improve performance across the acquisition portfolio.

{"pred": " The report discusses the Navy's readiness challenges, including maintenance delays, crew overwork, and training lapses. Following four significant mishaps in 2017 that resulted in 17 sailor deaths and ship damage, the Navy initiated internal reviews, leading to 111 recommendations to improve surface fleet readiness. As of November 2018, 78 (70%) of these recommendations had been implemented, with ongoing efforts to address fundamental readiness issues. The report highlights the Navy's progress in certifying crews, reducing expired certifications, and improving training standards. However, challenges such as maintenance delays, workforce gaps, and supply chain issues continue to hinder readiness recovery. The Navy faces significant affordability challenges as it plans to expand its fleet by 25% to meet future operational demands. The report also addresses the Marine Corps' readiness challenges, including limited amphibious operations training and aircraft availability issues. The Department of Defense has prioritized rebuilding readiness, with the 2018 National Defense Strategy emphasizing the importance of restoring and retaining readiness across the entire spectrum of conflict. Despite these efforts, the report indicates that the overall readiness of the military force remains low and has remained so since 2013. The Navy has made progress in addressing maintenance and training challenges, but persistent issues such as delayed maintenance, insufficient manning, and aging infrastructure continue to impact readiness. The report also highlights the challenges associated with the F-35 program, including sustainment issues, supply chain risks, and high maintenance costs. The Navy and Marine Corps are working to improve the availability of critical aviation platforms, but these efforts are expected to take time to yield results. The report concludes that the Navy's and Marine Corps' readiness challenges have developed over more than a decade of conflict, budget uncertainty, and reductions in force structure. Both services have made encouraging progress in identifying the causes of their readiness decline and have begun efforts to arrest and reverse it. However, the report emphasizes that fully addressing the persistent readiness challenges will require years of sustained management attention. The report includes 25 specific recommendations to the Navy and the Marine Corps and an additional 20 recommendations to various other DOD components to assist these services in rebuilding the readiness of their forces and in modernizing for the future. The report underscores the importance of implementing these recommendations to help the Navy and Marine Corps in their efforts to rebuild the readiness of their forces.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report.

The Navy and Marine Corps are working to rebuild the readiness of their forces while growing and modernizing their aging fleet of ships and aircraft. However, achieving readiness recovery goals will take years as both services continue to be challenged to rebuild readiness amid continued operational demands. This statement provides information on current and future readiness challenges facing (1) the Navy ship and submarine fleet and (2) Navy and Marine Corps aviation. GAO also discusses prior recommendations on Navy and Marine Corps readiness and progress to address them. This statement is based on previously published work since 2015 related to Navy and Marine Corps readiness challenges, including shipyard workforce and capital investment, ship crewing, weapon system sustainment, the fighter pilot workforce, and modernizing force structure. GAO conducted site visits to the Pacific fleet in November 2018 and analyzed updated data, as appropriate. The Navy has taken steps to address training shortfalls in the surface fleet, but faces persistent maintenance and personnel challenges as it seeks to rebuild ship and submarine readiness. While the Navy has corrective actions underway, they will take years to implement. Following ship collisions in 2017, the Navy has taken steps to ensure its crews are trained to standards prior to deployment and made significant progress in those efforts. However, the Navy has struggled to complete ship maintenance—with only 30 percent of maintenance completed on time since fiscal year 2012—leading to thousands of days that ships were unavailable for training and operations (see figure). Additionally, manning shortfalls and experience gaps continue to contribute to high sailor workload and are likely to continue through at least fiscal year 2021. The Navy has developed a plan to improve shipyards and is re-examining its ship manning, among other actions; however, these positive steps have not yet fully addressed GAO's recommendations. Looking to the future, the Navy has indicated that it wants to grow its fleet to meet demands. However, the costs of such growth are not yet known and would likely require resourcing well above currently planned levels. Navy and Marine Corps aircraft availability has been limited due to numerous challenges (see figure). Specifically, the seven aircraft GAO reviewed have generally experienced decreasing availability since fiscal year 2011 and did not meet availability goals in fiscal years 2017 and 2018. The F-35—the future of naval aviation—also has not met availability goals due to part shortages and poor sustainment planning. In September 2018, the Department of Defense established aggressive targets for aircraft availability. While the Navy and Marine Corps are taking actions to improve aircraft availability, including addressing GAO's recommendations, aviation readiness will take many years to recover. GAO has made a total of 45 recommendations in the prior work described in this statement.

{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report explains that FHA is part of HUD and insures private mortgages. If a borrower defaults, FHA pays the lender the remaining amount. The insurance protects the lender, not the borrower. FHA is one of three agencies (along with VA and USDA) that provide mortgage insurance. It's the most broadly targeted, meaning it doesn't have restrictions like veteran status or rural areas. However, there are other factors that can limit FHA mortgages, such as maximum mortgage amounts, insurance fees, and eligibility standards.\n\nThe report gives background on FHA's creation in 1934 during the Great Depression. Before FHA, mortgages were short-term and risky. FHA introduced 20-year mortgages with full repayment, which helped stabilize the mortgage market. Over time, 15- and 30-year mortgages became standard. FHA became part of HUD in 1965.\n\nThe main purpose of FHA is to make mortgages accessible to those who might not qualify through the private market, especially first-time buyers, low- and moderate-income households, and minorities. FHA-insured loans have lower down payment requirements (as low as 3.5%) and more lenient credit requirements compared to conventional mortgages. This helps borrowers with lower credit scores or limited funds to purchase homes.\n\nThe report also discusses FHA's role in the mortgage market as a countercyclical force. During economic downturns, FHA insures more mortgages when other lenders tighten credit. When the economy is strong, FHA's market share decreases as more conventional mortgages become available.\n\nThe report provides data on FHA's market share over the years, showing fluctuations based on economic conditions. It mentions that FHA's market share was around 14% of the home purchase mortgage market and 11% of the overall mortgage market between 1996 and 2002. However, by 2005, the market share had fallen to less than 5% of home-purchase mortgages and about 3% of the overall mortgage market. After the housing market turmoil starting around 2007, FHA's market share increased sharply, peaking at over 30% of home-purchase mortgages in 2009 and 2010, and", "answers": ["The Federal Housing Administration (FHA), an agency of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), was created by the National Housing Act of 1934. FHA insures private lenders against the possibility of borrowers defaulting on mortgages that meet certain criteria, thereby expanding the availability of mortgage credit beyond what may be available otherwise. If the borrower defaults on the mortgage, FHA is to repay the lender the remaining amount owed. A household that obtains an FHA-insured mortgage must meet FHA's eligibility and underwriting standards, including showing that it has sufficient income to repay a mortgage. FHA requires a minimum down payment of 3.5% from most borrowers, which is lower than the down payment required for many other types of mortgages. FHA-insured mortgages cannot exceed a statutory maximum mortgage amount, which varies by area and is based on area median house prices but cannot exceed a specified ceiling in high-cost areas. (The ceiling is set at $726,525 in high-cost areas in calendar year 2019.) Borrowers are charged fees, called mortgage insurance premiums, in exchange for the insurance. In FY2018, FHA insured over 1 million new mortgages (including both home purchase and refinance mortgages) with a combined principal balance of $209 billion. FHA's share of the mortgage market tends to vary with economic conditions and other factors. In the aftermath of the housing market turmoil that began around 2007 and a related contraction of mortgage lending, FHA insured a larger share of mortgages than it had in the preceding years. Its overall share of the mortgage market increased from about 3% in calendar year 2005 to a peak of 21% in 2009. Since that time, FHA's share of the mortgage market has decreased somewhat, though it remains higher than it was in the early 2000s. In calendar year 2017, FHA's overall share of the mortgage market was about 17%. FHA-insured mortgages, like all mortgages, experienced increased default rates during the housing downturn that began around 2007, leading to concerns about the stability of the FHA insurance fund for single-family mortgages, the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund). In response to these concerns, FHA adopted a number of policy changes in an attempt to limit risk to the MMI Fund. These changes have included raising the fees that it charges and making changes to certain eligibility criteria for FHA-insured loans."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5182}

The Navy's FY2019 budget requested $2.3 billion for the CVN-78 program, which is the first of the Ford-class carriers. The Navy also proposed to not fund the mid-life nuclear refueling overhaul (RCOH) for the CVN-75 (Harry S. Truman) and instead retire the ship around FY2024, which would reduce the carrier force to 10 ships. However, the Administration later withdrew this proposal, supporting funding for the RCOH and keeping the ship in service past FY2024. The report also discusses the Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan, which includes plans to increase the carrier force from 11 to 12 ships, and the potential for cost savings through a two-ship block buy contract. The report also highlights the challenges faced by the CVN-78 program, including cost overruns, technical issues with new systems like the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS), Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG), and the Advanced Weapons Elevators (AWE), and the need for the Navy to maintain a minimum of 11 operational carriers. The report also discusses the potential for Congress to shift from a 5-year center to a 3.5-year center for carrier procurement, which could help achieve a 12-carrier force by the 2030s.

Ford (CVN-78) class of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers (CVNs). CVN-78 (Gerald R. Ford) was procured in FY2008. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget estimates the ship's procurement cost at $13,084.0 million (i.e., about $13.1 billion) in then-year dollars. The ship received advance procurement (AP) funding in FY2001-FY2007 and was fully funded in FY2008-FY2011 using congressionally authorized four-year incremental funding. To help cover cost growth on the ship, the ship received an additional $1,394.9 million in FY2014-FY2016 and FY2018 cost-to-complete procurement funding. The ship was delivered to the Navy on May 31, 2017, and was commissioned into service on July 22, 2017. The Navy is currently working to complete construction, testing, and certification of the ship's 11 weapons elevators. CVN-79 (John F. Kennedy) was procured in FY2013. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget estimates the ship's procurement cost at $11,327.4 million (i.e., about $11.3 billion) in then-year dollars. The ship received AP funding in FY2007-FY2012, and was fully funded in FY2013-FY2018 using congressionally authorized six-year incremental funding. The ship is scheduled for delivery to the Navy in September 2024. CVN-80 (Enterprise) and CVN-81 (not yet named) are being procured under a two-ship block buy contract that was authorized by Section 121(a)(2) of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (H.R. 5515/P.L. 115-232 of August 13, 2018). The provision permitted the Navy to add CVN-81 to the existing contract for building CVN-80 after the Department of Defense (DOD) made certain certifications to Congress. DOD made the certifications on December 31, 2018, and the Navy announced the award of the contract on January 31, 2019. Compared to the estimated procurement costs for CVN-80 and CVN-81 in the Navy's FY2019 budget submission, the Navy estimates under its FY2020 budget submission that the two-ship block buy contract will reduce the cost of CVN-80 by $246.6 million and the cost of CVN-81 by $2,637.3 million, for a combined reduction of $2,883.9 million (i.e., about $2.9 billion). Using higher estimated baseline costs for CVN-80 and CVN-81 taken from a December 2017 Navy business case analysis, the Navy estimates under its FY2020 budget submission that the two-ship contract will reduce the cost of CVN-80 by $770.9 million and the cost of CVN-81 by $3,086.3 million, for a combined reduction of $3,857.2 million (i.e., about $3.9 billion). CVN-80 was procured in FY2018. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget estimates the ship's procurement cost at $12,335.1 million (i.e., about $12.3 billion) in then-year dollars. The ship received AP funding in FY2016 and FY2017, and the Navy plans to fully fund the ship in FY2018-FY2025 using incremental funding authorized by Section 121(c) of P.L. 115-232. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests $1,062.0 million in procurement funding for the ship. The ship is scheduled for delivery to the Navy in March 2028. Prior to the awarding of the two-ship block buy contract, CVN-81 was scheduled to be procured in FY2023. Following the awarding of the two-ship block buy contract, the Navy has chosen to show CVN-81 in its FY2020 budget submission as a ship to be procured in FY2020 (as opposed to a ship that was procured in FY2019). The Navy's FY2020 budget submission estimates the ship's procurement cost at $12,450.7 million (i.e., about $12.5 billion) in then-year dollars. The Navy plans to fully fund the ship beginning in FY2019 and extending beyond FY2026 using incremental funding authorized by Section 121(c) of P.L. 115-232. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests $1,285.0 million in procurement funding for the ship. The ship is scheduled for delivery to the Navy in February 2032. The Navy's FY2020 budget submission proposed to not fund the mid-life nuclear refueling overhaul (called a Refueling Complex Overhaul, or RCOH) for the aircraft carrier CVN-75 (Harry S. Truman), and to instead retire the ship around FY2024 and also deactivate one of the Navy's carrier air wings at about the same time. On April 30, 2019, however, the Administration announced that it was effectively withdrawing this proposal from the Navy's FY2020 budget submission.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report to understand the main points. \n\nThe report is about risk management for federal facilities, specifically focusing on the Interagency Security Committee (ISC) standards. It mentions that the ISC was established in 1995 after the Oklahoma City bombing. The ISC's role is to enhance security in federal facilities by developing standards and ensuring compliance. The report discusses the ISC Standard, which outlines a risk assessment process that includes evaluating threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences for each undesirable event. \n\nThe report then looks at four agencies: CBP, FAA, ARS, and the Forest Service. It finds that none of these agencies' assessment methodologies fully align with the ISC Standard. The ISC gives agencies some flexibility to design their own methodologies as long as they adhere to the fundamental principles of a sound risk management methodology. Specifically, methodologies must consider all of the undesirable events identified in the ISC Standard as possible risks to federal facilities and assess the three factors of risk (threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences) for each of the events. \n\nThe report also highlights that agencies are not always following these principles, leading to potential issues like inadequate security or unnecessary resource use. For example, some agencies didn't assess all 33 undesirable events, and others didn't evaluate threats and consequences. The report includes specific examples from the agencies, like CBP not updating their handbook to align with the ISC Standard, and FAA's methodology not addressing all the events. \n\nThe report also discusses the challenges agencies face in conducting physical security assessments and monitoring results. These include backlogs due to insufficient staff, competing priorities, and lack of long-term assessment schedules. Additionally, the agencies have issues with collecting and analyzing data to monitor their security programs effectively. \n\nThe report concludes with recommendations for the agencies to improve their alignment with the ISC standards. These include updating policies and procedures, developing feasible plans to address backlogs, and implementing long-term assessment schedules. The agencies have responded positively to the recommendations, indicating they are taking steps to align with the ISC standards.\n\nNow, I need to condense this into a one-page summary. I should start by outlining the main points: the purpose of the report, the ISC's role, the agencies reviewed, the findings about their methodologies not aligning with the standard, the challenges faced, and the recommendations. I need to make sure the summary is concise, covers all key aspects, and is easy to understand. I should avoid", "answers": ["Protecting federal employees and facilities from security threats is of critical importance. Most federal agencies are generally responsible for their facilities and have physical security programs to do so. GAO was asked to examine how federal agencies assess facilities' security risks. This report examines: (1) how selected agencies' assessment methodologies align with the ISC's risk management standard for identifying necessary countermeasures and (2) what management challenges, if any, selected agencies reported facing in conducting physical security assessments and monitoring the results. GAO selected four agencies—CBP, FAA, ARS, and the Forest Service—based on their large number of facilities and compared each agency's assessment methodology to the ISC Standard; analyzed facility assessment schedules and results from 2010 through 2016; and interviewed security officials. GAO also visited 13 facilities from these four agencies, selected based on geographical dispersion and their high risk level. None of the four agencies GAO reviewed—U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), and the Forest Service—used security assessment methodologies that fully aligned with the Interagency Security Committee's Risk Management Process for Federal Facilities standard (the ISC Standard). This standard requires that methodologies used to identify necessary facility countermeasures—such as fences and closed-circuit televisions—must: 1. Consider all of the undesirable events (i.e., arson and vandalism) identified by the ISC Standard as possible risks to facilities. 2. Assess three factors—threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences—for each of these events and use these three factors to measure risk. All four agencies used methodologies that included some ISC requirements when conducting assessments. CBP and FAA assessed vulnerabilities but not threats and consequences. ARS and the Forest Service assessed threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences, but did not use these factors to measure risk. In addition, the agencies considered many, but not all 33 undesirable events related to physical security as possible risks to their facilities. Agencies are taking steps to improve their methodologies. For example, ARS and the Forest Service now use a methodology that measures risk and plan to incorporate the methodology into policy. Although CBP and FAA have updated their methodologies, their policies do not require methodologies that fully align with the ISC standard. As a result, these agencies miss the opportunity for a more informed assessment of the risk to their facilities. All four agencies reported facing management challenges in conducting physical security assessments or monitoring assessment results. Specifically, CBP, ARS, and the Forest Service have not met the ISC's required time frame of every 3 years for conducting assessments. For example, security specialists have not conducted required reassessments of two ARS and one Forest Service higher-level facilities. While these three agencies have plans to address backlogs, CBP's plan does not balance conducting risk assessments with other competing security priorities, such as updating its policy manual, and ARS and the Forest Service lack a means to monitor completion of future assessments. Furthermore, CBP, ARS, and the Forest Service did not have the data or information systems to monitor assessment schedules or the status of countermeasures at facilities, and their policies did not specify such data requirements. For example, ARS and the Forest Service do not collect and analyze security-related data, such as countermeasures' implementation. FAA does not routinely monitor the performance of its physical security program. Without improved monitoring, agencies are not well equipped to prioritize their highest security needs, may leave facilities' vulnerabilities unaddressed, and may not take corrective actions to meet physical security program objectives. This is a public version of a sensitive report that GAO issued in August 2017. Information that the agencies under review deemed sensitive has been omitted. GAO recommends: (1) that CBP and FAA update policies to require the use of methodologies fully aligned with the ISC Standard; (2) that CBP revise its plan to eliminate the assessments backlog; and (3) that all four agencies improve monitoring of their physical security programs. All four agencies agreed with the respective recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6755}
{"pred": " The report discusses the Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) system used by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to estimate improper payment rates in the Medicaid program. PERM is mandated by the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA) and its amendments, which require federal agencies to identify programs susceptible to improper payments and estimate the amount of such payments annually. The report highlights that while PERM provides a statistically valid estimate of improper payments, it does not account for key program integrity risks in Medicaid managed care, such as overpayments to providers and unallowable MCO costs. These risks are not captured by the PERM methodology, which focuses on capitated payments and does not include medical reviews or assessments of MCO records. The report also notes that the PERM improper payment rate for Medicaid managed care is significantly lower than that for Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS), but this difference does not indicate better oversight. Instead, it reflects differences in the review criteria between FFS and managed care, which result in a less complete accounting for program integrity risks in managed care. The report further states that the PERM methodology is not sufficient to ensure the identification and reporting of overpayments and unallowable costs in Medicaid managed care, as these risks are not addressed by the current oversight mechanisms. The report also highlights that the PERM methodology is being reviewed as part of the fiscal year 2017 compliance review, and that the findings from the focused reviews of managed care programs indicate that states are not effectively identifying and reporting overpayments to providers and unallowable costs. The report concludes that the PERM likely underestimates program integrity risks in Medicaid managed care, and that without addressing these risks, CMS and states cannot ensure the integrity of the Medicaid program. The report also recommends that CMS consider and take steps to mitigate the program risks that are not measured in the PERM, such as overpayments and unallowable costs, which could include actions such as revising the PERM methodology or focusing additional audit resources on managed care. The report was reviewed by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which concurred with the recommendation and indicated that it will review regulatory authority and audit resources to determine the best way to account for Medicaid program risks that are not accounted for in the PERM. However, HHS stated that the PERM is not intended to measure all Medicaid program integrity risks, and utilizing the PERM measurement in that way would be a misunderstanding and misuse of the reported rate. H", "answers": ["The improper payment rate is a sentinel measure of program integrity risks for the Medicaid program. CMS and the states oversee Medicaid, whose size, structure, and diversity make it vulnerable to improper payments. CMS estimates the Medicaid improper payment rate annually through its PERM, which includes an estimate for Medicaid managed care, in which states contract with MCOs to provide services to Medicaid enrollees. GAO was asked to study the PERM methodology for managed care. In this report, GAO examined the extent to which the PERM accounts for program integrity risks in Medicaid managed care, including CMS's and states' oversight. GAO identified program integrity risks reported in 27 federal and state audits and investigations issued between January 2012 and September 2017; reviewed federal regulations and guidance on the PERM and CMS's Focused Program Integrity Reviews; and contacted program integrity officials in the 16 states with a majority of 2016 Medicaid spending for managed care, as well as CMS officials and program integrity experts. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) estimate of improper payments for Medicaid managed care has limitations that are not mitigated by the agency's and states' current oversight efforts. One component of the Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) measures the accuracy of capitated payments, which are periodic payments that state Medicaid agencies make to managed care organizations (MCO) to provide services to enrollees and to cover other allowable costs, such as administrative expenses. However, the managed care component of the PERM neither includes a medical review of services delivered to enrollees, nor reviews of MCO records or data. Further, GAO's review of the 27 federal and state audits and investigations identified key program risks. Ten of the 27 federal and state audits and investigations identified about $68 million in overpayments and unallowable MCO costs that were not accounted for by PERM estimates; another of these investigations resulted in a $137.5 million settlement. These audits and investigations were conducted over more than 5 years and involved a small fraction of the more than 270 MCOs operating nationwide as of September 2017. To the extent that overpayments and unallowable costs are unidentified and not removed from the cost data used to set capitation rates, they may allow inflated MCO payments and minimize the appearance of program risks in Medicaid managed care. CMS and states have taken steps to improve oversight of Medicaid managed care through updated regulations, focused reviews of states' managed care programs, and federal program integrity contractors' audits of managed care services. However, some of these efforts went into effect only recently, and others are unlikely to address the risks in managed care across all states. Furthermore, these efforts do not ensure the identification and reporting of overpayments to providers and unallowable costs by MCOs. Federal internal control standards call for agency management to identify and respond to risks. Without addressing key risks, such as the extent of overpayments and unallowable costs, CMS cannot be certain that its estimated improper payment rate for managed care (0.3 percent compared with 12.9 percent in Medicaid fee-for-service) accurately reflects program risks. The Administrator of CMS should consider and take steps to mitigate the program risks that are not measured in the PERM, such as overpayments and unallowable costs; such an effort could include actions such as revising the PERM methodology or focusing additional audit resources on managed care.

{"pred": " The Federal Reserve (the Fed) is the United States' central bank, responsible for monetary policy, providing emergency liquidity as a lender of last resort, supervising financial institutions for safety and soundness, and operating the payment system. Congress delegates monetary policy to the Fed but retains oversight to ensure the Fed adheres to its mandate of \"maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.\" The Fed defines stable prices as a long-run goal of 2% inflation, measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. While the Fed does not specify a fixed goal for employment, it emphasizes the importance of assessing the maximum level of employment, acknowledging that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision. Monetary policy can be used to stabilize business cycle fluctuations in the short run, while it mainly affects inflation in the long run. The Fed's conventional tool for monetary policy is to target the federal funds rate—the overnight, interbank lending rate. This report provides an overview of how monetary policy works and recent developments, a summary of the Fed's actions following the financial crisis, and ends with a brief overview of the Fed's regulatory responsibilities. In December 2008, during the financial crisis and the \"Great Recession,\" the Fed lowered the federal funds rate to a range of 0% to 0.25%. This was the first time rates were ever lowered to what is referred to as the zero lower bound. The recession ended in 2009, but as the economic recovery consistently proved weaker than expected in the years that followed, the Fed repeatedly pushed back its time frame for raising interest rates. As a result, the economic expansion was in its seventh year and the unemployment rate was already near the Fed's estimate of full employment when it began raising rates on December 16, 2015. This was a departure from past practice—in the previous two economic expansions, the Fed began raising rates within three years of the preceding recession ending. Since then, the Fed has continued to raise rates in a series of steps to incrementally tighten monetary policy. The Fed raised rates once in 2016, three times in 2017, and four times in 2018, by 0.25 percentage points each time. The Fed has stated that \"some further gradual increases in ... the federal funds rate\" are necessary to fulfill its mandate. The Fed describes its plans as \"data dependent,\" meaning they would be altered if actual employment or inflation", "answers": ["Congress has delegated responsibility for monetary policy to the Federal Reserve (the Fed), the nation's central bank, but retains oversight responsibilities for ensuring that the Fed is adhering to its statutory mandate of \"maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.\" To meet its price stability mandate, the Fed has set a longer-run goal of 2% inflation. The Fed's control over monetary policy stems from its exclusive ability to alter the money supply and credit conditions more broadly. Normally, the Fed conducts monetary policy by setting a target for the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks borrow and lend reserves on an overnight basis. It meets its target through open market operations, financial transactions traditionally involving U.S. Treasury securities. Beginning in 2007, the federal funds target was reduced from 5.25% to a range of 0% to 0.25% in December 2008, which economists call the zero lower bound. By historical standards, rates were kept unusually low for an unusually long time to mitigate the effects of the financial crisis and its aftermath. Starting in December 2015, the Fed has been raising interest rates and expects to gradually raise rates further. The Fed raised rates once in 2016, three times in 2017, and four times in 2018, by 0.25 percentage points each time. In light of increased economic uncertainty and financial volatility, the Fed announced in January 2019 that it would be \"patient\" before raising rates again. The Fed influences interest rates to affect interest-sensitive spending, such as business capital spending on plant and equipment, household spending on consumer durables, and residential investment. In addition, when interest rates diverge between countries, it causes capital flows that affect the exchange rate between foreign currencies and the dollar, which in turn affects spending on exports and imports. Through these channels, monetary policy can be used to stimulate or slow aggregate spending in the short run. In the long run, monetary policy mainly affects inflation. A low and stable rate of inflation promotes price transparency and, thereby, sounder economic decisions. The Fed's relative independence from Congress and the Administration has been justified by many economists on the grounds that it reduces political pressure to make monetary policy decisions that are inconsistent with a long-term focus on stable inflation. But independence reduces accountability to Congress and the Administration, and recent legislation and criticism of the Fed by the President has raised the question about the proper balance between the two. While the federal funds target was at the zero lower bound, the Fed attempted to provide additional stimulus through unsterilized purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities (MBS), a practice popularly referred to as quantitative easing (QE). Between 2009 and 2014, the Fed undertook three rounds of QE. The third round was completed in October 2014, at which point the Fed's balance sheet was $4.5 trillion—five times its precrisis size. After QE ended, the Fed maintained the balance sheet at the same level until September 2017, when it began to very gradually reduce it to a more normal size. The Fed has raised interest rates in the presence of a large balance sheet through the use of two new tools—by paying banks interest on reserves held at the Fed and by engaging in reverse repurchase agreements (reverse repos) through a new overnight facility. In January 2019, the Fed announced that it would continue using these tools to set interest rates permanently, in which case the balance sheet may not get much smaller than its current size of $4 trillion. With regard to its mandate, the Fed believes that unemployment is currently lower than the rate that it considers consistent with maximum employment, and inflation is close to the Fed's 2% goal by the Fed's preferred measure. Even after recent rate increases, monetary policy is still considered expansionary. This monetary policy stance is unusually stimulative compared with policy in this stage of previous expansions, and is being coupled with a stimulative fiscal policy (larger structural budget deficit). Debate is currently focused on how quickly the Fed should raise rates. Some contend the greater risk is that raising rates too slowly at full employment will cause inflation to become too high or cause financial instability, whereas others contend that raising rates too quickly will cause inflation to remain too low and choke off the expansion."], "all_classes": null, "length": 7241}
{"pred": " The report discusses the Buy American Act of 1933, which aims to promote domestic manufacturing by giving the federal government a preference for purchasing end products made in the United States. The Act applies to various federal procurements, including aircraft engines and medical supplies, but does not apply to products purchased for use outside the United States or contracts under the micro-purchase threshold (generally $3,500 in fiscal year 2017). The Act defines domestic end products based on the country of origin, not the vendor's location. For example, a vendor in Finland could supply end products made in the United States, which would be considered domestic, while a vendor in the United States could supply end products made in Finland, which would be considered foreign. The Act allows for exceptions to the domestic preference, such as when a domestic end product is not available in sufficient quantities or when the cost would be unreasonable to buy a domestic end product. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 waives the Buy American Act's requirements for certain acquisitions of foreign end products from countries that are party to international trade agreements or are designated countries by the U.S. Trade Representative. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) outlines several exceptions that permit federal agencies to buy foreign end products, including situations where a domestic end product is not produced in sufficient quantities or cases where the cost would be unreasonable to buy a domestic end product. The report also highlights the challenges in accurately reporting the use of Buy American Act exceptions and trade agreement waivers, as well as the limitations of the FPDS-NG system in capturing this information. The report found that agencies faced various levels of difficulty in applying the Trade Agreements Act waivers and Buy American Act exceptions to acquire foreign end products. This was particularly apparent in cases where contracting officers had to determine if a trade agreement applied or cases which required a determination that a domestic end product was not sufficiently available, in accordance with the domestic non-availability exception to the Buy American Act requirements. The report also found that some aspects of how FPDS-NG is structured could lead to additional data reporting errors. For example, the report found that FPDS-NG does not prevent agencies from reporting trade agreement waivers when the contracts are valued below applicable thresholds or when waivers do not apply, such as for small business set asides. The report also found that FPDS-NG data on the use of Buy American Act exceptions were not fully captured due to data entry errors and system limitations. The report concludes that while the federal government purchases foreign", "answers": ["The Buy American Act of 1933, as amended, is the main U.S. law promoting domestic purchasing. The Act permits agencies to buy foreign end products only under certain exceptions, such as when domestic items are not available at a reasonable cost. Further, U.S. trade agreements waive the Buy American restrictions for certain products. GAO was asked to review implementation of the Buy American Act. This report assesses the extent to which (1) the federal government procures foreign products through Buy American Act exceptions and waivers; and (2) selected agencies provide training and guidance to implement the Act. GAO reviewed laws, regulations, and policies related to the Buy American Act and analyzed data for fiscal year 2017 from FPDS-NG. GAO also analyzed a non-generalizable sample of 38 contracts from DOD, HHS, DHS, and VA—the agencies with the most obligations for products in fiscal year 2017. The 38 awards selected include a mix of foreign and domestic products, as well as dollars obligated. Finally, GAO interviewed cognizant contracting and policy officials from the selected agencies. According to data reported in the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) in fiscal year 2017, foreign end products accounted for less than 5 percent—about $7.8 billion—of federal obligations for products potentially subject to the Buy American Act. Federal agencies procured foreign products using exceptions to Buy American Act requirements, as well as through waivers or when the Buy American Act did not apply, as shown in the figure. The amount of foreign end products purchased could be greater than reported in FPDS-NG, however, due to reporting errors and system limitations. GAO found that 6 of the 38 contracts reviewed from the Departments of Defense (DOD), Health and Human Services (HHS), Homeland Security (DHS), and Veterans Affairs (VA) inaccurately recorded waiver or exception information. FPDS-NG system limitations compound these errors because it does not fully capture Buy American Act data. Among other things, the database does not always enable agencies to report the use of exceptions or waivers on contracts for both foreign and domestic products, reducing data accuracy. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is considering strategies to improve Buy American Act data. The four agencies GAO reviewed varied in their approaches to Buy American Act training and guidance. DOD reports that it will have trained more than 18,000 personnel by the end of 2018. DHS reports training almost 1,400 people—approximately 94 percent of its contracting staff—as of April 2018. Some VA courses mention the Act, but none is focused specifically on implementing its requirements. HHS does not have agency-level training or guidance on the Act. GAO found that contracting officers for the contracts it reviewed face challenges implementing Buy American Act requirements. Having specific and targeted Buy American Act guidance and training can better ensure that agencies meet the Act's requirements. GAO is recommending that OMB take steps to improve Buy American Act data and that HHS, DHS, and VA improve agency guidance and training on implementing the Act.

NG911 systems provide call centers with advanced capabilities to route and transfer calls and data, improving their ability to handle overflow calls and increase information sharing with first responders. The report outlines the evolution of 911 services, from basic 911 to Enhanced 911, and then to NG911, which allows for the integration of various technologies and data. The report also highlights the challenges faced by states and localities in implementing NG911, including funding issues, technical challenges, and governance complexities. The National 911 Program, in collaboration with other federal agencies, has taken various actions to address these challenges, such as providing grants, conducting cost studies, and issuing guides on technology standards and procurement practices. Additionally, the program is working on developing a National NG911 Roadmap to coordinate the transition of 911 systems nationwide. However, the report notes that the National 911 Program lacks specific goals and performance measures to assess the effectiveness of its activities. The program is in the early stages of establishing an interagency initiative to create a National NG911 Roadmap, which aims to identify national-level tasks needed to advance NG911 implementation. The report concludes that without clear roles and responsibilities for federal agencies and a plan to support the roadmap’s objectives, the National 911 Program may struggle to effectively assist states and localities in transitioning to a fully integrated national NG911 system. The report also includes recommendations for the Administrator of NHTSA to develop specific program goals and performance measures related to NG911 implementation, determine roles and responsibilities of federal agencies participating in the National NG911 Roadmap initiative, and develop an implementation plan to support the completion of the roadmap’s national-level tasks.

However, the nation's legacy 911 system relies on aging infrastructure that is not designed to accommodate modern communications technologies. As a result, states and localities are upgrading to NG911, which offers improved capabilities, such as the ability to process images, audio files, and video. While deploying NG911 is the responsibility of state and local entities, federal agencies also support implementation, led by NHTSA's National 911 Program, which facilitates collaboration among federal, state, and local 911 stakeholders. GAO was asked to review NG911 implementation nationwide. This report examines: (1) state and local progress and challenges in implementing NG911 and (2) federal actions to address challenges and planned next steps. GAO reviewed relevant statutes, regulations, and federal agency reports and plans. GAO also analyzed NHTSA's survey data on state 911 implementation for calendar year 2015, the most recent year for which data were available, and interviewed federal officials, state and local officials from nine states (selected to represent different regions and various phases of NG911 implementation), and officials from industry and advocacy groups. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) National 911 Program's most recent national survey on Next Generation 911 (NG911) implementation indicated that about half of states were in some phase of transition to NG911 in 2015, but that state and local progress varied. Specifically, 10 states reported that all 911 authorities in their state processed calls using NG911 systems; however, 18 states reported having no state or local NG911 transition plans in place—which may indicate these states were in the early phases of planning for the transition to NG911 or had not yet begun. GAO spoke with state and local 911 officials in 9 states, which were in various phases of implementing NG911, and found that none of the 9 selected states were accepting images, audio files, or video. State and local 911 officials identified a number of challenges to implementing NG911. Such challenges are related to funding, evolving technology and operations, and governance. For example, officials in 3 states said that the current funding they collect from telephone service subscribers may not be sufficient to support NG911's transition costs while simultaneously funding the operation of existing 911 systems. Federal agencies—including NHTSA, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the Federal Communications Commission, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security—have responsibilities to support NG911 implementation, such as through coordinating activities and administering grants, and are taking actions to assist state and local entities in addressing challenges to NG911's implementation. Such actions include developing resources, offering technical assistance, and convening stakeholders to explore emerging NG911 issues. For example, as the lead entity for coordinating federal NG911 efforts, NHTSA's National 911 Program is developing resources on NG911 topics, such as federal funding and governance structures. While the National 911 Program is taking steps to facilitate the state and local transition to NG911, the program lacks specific performance goals and measures to assess its progress. Without such goals and measures, it is not clear to what extent the program is effectively achieving its mission. In 2018, the National 911 Program plans to establish an interagency initiative tasked with creating a National NG911 Roadmap. This roadmap is intended to identify next steps for the federal government in supporting the creation of a national, interconnected NG911 system. While the National 911 Program is taking steps to develop a list of national-level tasks as part of its roadmap initiative, the program does not have a plan to identify: (1) roles or responsibilities for federal entities to carry out these tasks or (2) how the program plans to achieve the roadmap's objectives. Collaborating with the appropriate federal agencies to determine federal roles and responsibilities to carry out the roadmap's national-level tasks could reduce barriers to agencies effectively working together to achieve those tasks. Furthermore, developing an implementation plan that details how the roadmap's tasks will be achieved would place the National 911 Program in a better position to effectively lead interagency efforts to implement NG911 nationwide.

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report explains that the RRB administers retirement, survivor, disability, unemployment, and sickness insurance for railroad workers and their families under the RRA and RUIA. These acts cover workers employed by railroads engaged in interstate commerce and related entities. Lifelong railroad workers receive benefits from the RRB instead of Social Security, while those with non-railroad experience get benefits based on their railroad service duration.\n\nThe number of railroad workers has been declining since the 1950s, but there were fluctuations. The lowest point was 215,000 in 2010, then increased to 253,000 in 2015, which was the highest since 1999. However, by FY2017, the number had dropped to 221,000. The total beneficiaries under RRA and RUIA decreased from 623,000 in FY2008 to 574,000 in FY2017. Benefit payments increased from $10.1 billion to $12.6 billion during the same period. In FY2017, the RRB paid nearly $12.5 billion in retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to about 548,000 beneficiaries. Around $105.4 million in unemployment and sickness benefits were paid to about 28,000 claimants.\n\nThe report discusses the programs under RRA and RUIA, including how they are financed, eligibility rules, and types of benefits. It also relates railroad retirement to the Social Security system. The RRA authorizes retirement, survivor, and disability benefits. In 2017, there were 526,100 RRA beneficiaries, down from 672,400 in 2001. The average monthly benefit was about $1,986 in 2017, up from $1,043 in 2001.

During FY2017, the RRB paid nearly $12.5 billion in retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to approximately 548,000 beneficiaries and paid $105.4 million in unemployment and sickness benefits to approximately 28,000 claimants. Of the total $12.5 billion benefit payments in the same fiscal year, 60.0% was paid to retired workers, 8.0% to disabled workers, 14.4% to spouses, and 16.8% to survivors. The Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) authorizes retirement, disability, and survivor benefits for railroad workers and their families. RRA is financed primarily by payroll taxes, financial interchanges from Social Security, and transfers from the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT). Railroad retirement payroll taxes have two tiers: the Tier I tax is essentially the same as the Social Security payroll tax and the Tier II tax is set each year based on the railroad retirement system's asset balances, benefit payments, and administrative costs. In FY2017, the gross RRA funding was about $12.7 billion. Railroad retirement annuities are also divided into two tiers. Tier I annuities are designed to be nearly equivalent to Social Security benefits and are based on both railroad retirement and Social Security-covered employment. However, Tier I annuities are more generous than Social Security benefits in certain situations. For example, at the age of 60, railroad workers with at least 30 years of covered railroad work may receive unreduced retirement annuities. Tier II annuities are similar to private pensions and based solely on covered railroad service. Tier II annuities are paid in addition to Tier I annuities. Railroad disability annuities may be payable to totally disabled railroad workers who are permanently disabled from all work and occupational disabled workers who are found to be permanently disabled from their regular railroad occupations. Eligible spouses and survivors of railroad workers may receive a certain portion of Tier I and Tier II benefits, but divorced spouses and surviving divorced spouses are eligible for only a certain portion of Tier I benefits. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA) authorizes unemployment and sickness benefits for railroad workers. RUIA is financed solely by railroad employers, whose contributions are based on the taxable earnings of their employees. Eligibility for railroad unemployment and sickness benefits is based on recent railroad service and earnings. The maximum daily unemployment and sickness benefit payable in the benefit year that began July 1, 2018, is $77, and the maximum benefit for a biweekly claim is $770. Normal benefits are paid for up to 26 weeks in a benefit year. The railroad unemployment and sickness system remains affected by sequestration, as unemployment benefits will continue to be reduced through at least September 30, 2019."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3573}
{"pred": " The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is responsible for providing healthcare, benefits, and memorials to veterans. The VA operates three main components: the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA). These components rely on approximately 340,000 employees to deliver services and benefits. The VA also operates a significant IT infrastructure to support its mission, including the management of over 576 IT systems. The VHA is responsible for managing 319 of these systems, with 244 being mission-related and focused on healthcare delivery. One of the key systems is VistA, an integrated medical information system developed in-house by VA clinicians and IT personnel since the early 1980s. VistA is comprised of more than 200 applications that assist in the delivery of healthcare and perform other important functions within the department, including financial management, enrollment, and registration. Some of these applications have been in operation for over 30 years and, according to VA, have become increasingly difficult and costly to maintain. As such, the department has expended extensive resources to modernize the system and increase its ability to allow for the viewing or exchange of patient information with the Department of Defense (DOD) and private sector health providers. The VA has been working on several initiatives to modernize its health information system, including the HealtheVet, the integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR), VistA Evolution, and the Electronic Health Record Modernization (EHRM) programs. These programs have faced various challenges, including delays, cost overruns, and the need for additional resources. The VA has also been working on implementing the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA), which aims to improve the management of IT acquisitions and ensure that federal agencies are using their resources effectively. The VA has made progress in some areas of FITARA, such as data center consolidation and software licensing management. However, the department still has work to do in other areas, such as incremental development and optimization of IT systems. The VA has also been working on modernizing its legacy systems, which are outdated and have become increasingly difficult and costly to maintain.

However, VA has faced challenges spanning a number of critical initiatives related to modernizing its major systems. To improve all major federal agencies' acquisitions and hold them accountable for reducing duplication and achieving cost savings, in December 2014 Congress enacted federal IT acquisition reform legislation (commonly referred to as the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act , or FITARA). GAO was asked to summarize its previous and ongoing work regarding VA's history of efforts to modernize VistA, including past use of contractors, and the department's recent effort to acquire a commercial electronic health record system to replace VistA. GAO was also asked to provide an update on VA's progress in key FITARA-related areas, including (1) data center consolidation and optimization, (2) incremental system development practices, and (3) software license management. VA generally agreed with the information upon which this statement is based. For nearly two decades, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has undertaken multiple efforts to modernize its health information system—the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (known as VistA). Two of VA's most recent efforts included the Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) program, a joint program with the Department of Defense (DOD) intended to replace separate systems used by VA and DOD with a single system; and the VistA Evolution program, which was to modernize VistA with additional capabilities and a better interface for all users. VA has relied extensively on assistance from contractors for these efforts. VA obligated over $1.1 billion for contracts with 138 contractors during fiscal years 2011 through 2016 for iEHR and VistA Evolution. Contract data showed that the 15 key contractors that worked on both programs accounted for $741 million of the funding obligated for system development, project management, and operations and maintenance to support the two programs (see figure). VA recently announced that it intends to change its VistA modernization approach and acquire the same electronic health record system that DOD is implementing. With respect to key FITARA-related areas, the department has reported progress on consolidating and optimizing its data centers, although this progress has fallen short of targets set by the Office of Management and Budget. VA has also reported $23.61 million in data center-related cost savings, yet does not expect to realize further savings from additional closures. In addition, VA's Chief Information Officer (CIO) certified the use of adequate incremental development for 10 of the department's major IT investments; however, VA has not yet updated its policy and process for CIO certification as GAO recommended. Finally, VA has issued a software licensing policy and has generated an inventory of its software licenses to inform future investment decisions.

{"pred": " The report examines the relationship between climate change and migration, highlighting the complex and multifaceted nature of this connection. Climate change is identified as a significant factor in both slow-onset disasters, such as drought, crop failure, and sea level rise, and sudden-onset disasters, including floods and extreme weather events. These environmental changes can lead to internal migration, while cross-border migration due to climate change is less common. The report notes that while climate change may influence migration decisions, the role it plays is debated, with some factors such as economic and political conditions being more directly related. The report also discusses the challenges in estimating the number of people displaced by climate change, as there are no reliable global estimates for those migrating due to slow-onset disasters, and estimates for sudden-onset disasters are based on limited data. The lack of reliable data is due in part to the multi-causal nature of migration. The report also highlights that forecasts for environmental migrants by 2050 vary from 25 million to 1 billion, with some studies questioning the methodologies used to arrive at these broad estimates. The report further notes that migration, potentially driven by climate change, may contribute to instability and result in national security challenges, according to some international organizations and national governments. For example, an influx of migrants to a city may put pressure on existing resources, resulting in tensions between new migrants and residents, or between the population and its government. The U.S. Global Change Research Program has also stated that migration, such as displacement resulting from extreme weather events, is a potential national security issue. The report also discusses the impact of climate change on migration trends and challenges in stability and security across various regions, including Asia, South America, the Arctic, Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, Oceania, and Central America and the Caribbean.

For example, climate change can increase the frequency and intensity of natural disasters, causing populations to move from an area. Climate change can also intensify slow-onset disasters, such as drought, crop failure, or sea level rise, potentially altering longer-term migration trends. GAO was asked to review how U.S. agencies address climate change as a potential driver of global migration. For State, USAID, and DOD, this report (1) describes executive branch actions related to climate change and migration from fiscal years 2014 through 2018; (2) examines the extent to which the agencies discussed the potential effects of climate change on migration in their plans and risk assessments; and (3) describes agency activities on the issue. GAO analyzed documents on administration priorities; reviewed agency plans, risk assessments, and documentation of agency activities; and interviewed agency officials. From fiscal years 2014 through 2018, a variety of executive branch actions related to climate change—such as executive orders and strategies—affected the Department of State (State), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Department of Defense (DOD), including their activities that could potentially address the nexus of climate change and migration. For example, a fiscal year 2016 presidential memorandum—rescinded in 2017—required agencies to develop implementation plans to identify the potential impact of climate change on human mobility, among other things. In general, however, climate change as a driver of migration was not a focus of the executive branch actions. For example, a fiscal year 2014 executive order—also rescinded in 2017—requiring agencies to prepare for the impacts of climate change did not highlight migration as a particular concern. State, USAID, and DOD have discussed the potential effects of climate change on migration in agency plans and risk assessments. For example, State and USAID required climate change risk assessments when developing country and regional strategies, and a few of the strategies reviewed by GAO identified the nexus of climate change and migration as a risk. However, State changed its approach in 2017, no longer providing missions with guidance on whether and how to include climate change risks in their integrated country strategies. In doing so, State did not include in its 2018 guidance to the missions any information on how to include climate change risks, should the missions choose to do so. Without clear guidance, State may miss opportunities to identify and address issues related to climate change as a potential driver of migration. The three agencies have been involved in climate change related activities but none were specifically focused on the nexus with global migration. For example, USAID officials said that the agency's adaptation efforts, such as its Pastoralist Areas Resilience Improvement through Market Expansion project in Ethiopia, were the most likely to include activities, such as enhancing resilience, that can indirectly address the issue of climate change as a driver of migration. GAO recommends that State provide missions with guidance that clearly documents its process for climate change risk assessments for country strategies.

IEEPA, like the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA) from which it branched, sits at the center of the modern U.S. sanctions regime. Changes in the use of IEEPA powers since the act's enactment in 1977 have caused some to question whether the statute's oversight provisions are robust enough given the sweeping economic powers it confers upon the President upon declaration of a state of emergency. Over the course of the twentieth century, Congress delegated increasing amounts of emergency power to the President by statute. The Trading with the Enemy Act was one such statute. Congress passed TWEA in 1917 to regulate international transactions with enemy powers following the U.S. entry into the First World War. Congress expanded the act during the 1930s to allow the President to declare a national emergency in times of peace and assume sweeping powers over both domestic and international transactions. Between 1945 and the early 1970s, TWEA became a critically important means to impose sanctions as part of U.S. Cold War strategy. Presidents used TWEA to block international financial transactions, seize U.S.-based assets held by foreign nationals, restrict exports, modify regulations to deter the hoarding of gold, limit foreign direct investment in U.S. companies, and impose tariffs on all imports into the United States. Following committee investigations that discovered that the United States had been in a state of emergency for more than 40 years, Congress passed the National Emergencies Act (NEA) in 1976 and IEEPA in 1977. The pair of statutes placed new limits on presidential emergency powers. Both included reporting requirements to increase transparency and track costs, and the NEA required the President to annually assess and extend, if appropriate, the emergency. However, some experts argue that the renewal process has become pro forma. The NEA also afforded Congress the means to terminate a national emergency by adopting a concurrent resolution in each chamber. A decision by the Supreme Court, in a landmark immigration case, however, found the use of concurrent resolutions to terminate an executive action unconstitutional. Congress amended the statute to require a joint resolution, significantly increasing the difficulty of terminating an emergency. Like TWEA, IEEPA has become an important means to impose economic-based sanctions since its enactment; like TWEA, Presidents have frequently used IEEPA to restrict a variety of international transactions; and like TWEA, the subjects of the restrictions, the frequency of use, and the duration of emergencies have expanded over time. Initially, Presidents targeted foreign states or their governments. Over the years, however, presidential administrations have increasingly used IEEPA to target individuals, groups, and non-state actors such as terrorists and persons who engage in malicious cyber-enabled activities. As of March 1, 2019, Presidents had declared 54 national emergencies invoking IEEPA, 29 of which are still ongoing. Typically, national emergencies invoking IEEPA last nearly a decade, although some have lasted significantly longer--the first state of emergency declared under the NEA and IEEPA, which was declared in response to the taking of U.S. embassy staff as hostages by Iran in 1979, may soon enter its fifth decade. IEEPA grants sweeping powers to the President to control economic transactions. Despite these broad powers, Congress has never attempted to terminate a national emergency invoking IEEPA. Instead, Congress has directed the President on numerous occasions to use IEEPA authorities to impose sanctions. Congress may want to consider whether IEEPA appropriately balances the need for swift action in a time of crisis with Congress' duty to oversee executive action. Congress may also want to consider IEEPA's role in implementing its influence in U.S. foreign policy and national security decision-making."], "all_classes": null, "length": 14753}

Interstate pipelines run through remote areas and highly populated urban areas, and are vulnerable to accidents, operating errors, and malicious physical and cyber-based attack or intrusion. The energy sector accounted for 35 percent of the 796 critical infrastructure cyber incidents reported to DHS from 2013 to 2015. Several federal and private entities have roles in pipeline security. TSA is primarily responsible for the oversight of pipeline physical security and cybersecurity. GAO was asked to review TSA's efforts to assess and enhance pipeline security and cybersecurity. This report examines, among other objectives: (1) the guidance pipeline operators reported using to address security risks and the extent that TSA ensures its guidelines reflect the current threat environment; (2) the extent that TSA has assessed pipeline systems' security risks; and (3) the extent TSA has assessed its effectiveness in reducing pipeline security risks. GAO analyzed TSA documents, such as its Pipeline Security Guidelines ; evaluated TSA pipeline risk assessment efforts; and interviewed TSA officials, 10 U.S. pipeline operators—selected based on volume, geography, and material transported—and representatives from five industry associations. Pipeline operators reported using a range of guidelines and standards to address physical and cybersecurity risks, including the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) Pipeline Security Guidelines , initially issued in 2011. TSA issued revised guidelines in March 2018 to reflect changes in the threat environment and incorporate most of the principles and practices from the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity . However, TSA's revisions do not include all elements of the current framework and TSA does not have a documented process for reviewing and revising its guidelines on a regular basis. Without such a documented process, TSA cannot ensure that its guidelines reflect the latest known standards and best practices for physical security and cybersecurity, or address the dynamic security threat environment that pipelines face. Further, GAO found that the guidelines lack clear definitions to ensure that pipeline operators identify their critical facilities. GAO's analysis showed that operators of at least 34 of the nation's top 100 critical pipeline systems (determined by volume of product transported) deemed highest risk had identified no critical facilities. This may be due, in part, to the guidelines not clearly defining the criteria to determine facilities' criticality. To assess pipeline security risks, TSA conducts pipeline security reviews—Corporate Security Reviews and Critical Facility Security Reviews—to assess pipeline systems' vulnerabilities. However, GAO found that the number of TSA security reviews has varied considerably over the last several years, as shown in the table on the following page. TSA officials stated that staffing limitations have prevented TSA from conducting more reviews. Staffing levels for TSA's Pipeline Security Branch have varied significantly since fiscal year 2010 with the number of staff ranging from 14 full-time equivalents in fiscal years 2012 and 2013 to 1 in 2014. Further, TSA does not have a strategic workforce plan to help ensure it identifies the skills and competencies—such as the required level of cybersecurity expertise—necessary to carry out its pipeline security responsibilities. By establishing a strategic workforce plan, TSA can help ensure that it has identified the necessary skills, competencies, and staffing. GAO also identified factors that likely limit the usefulness of TSA's risk assessment methodology for prioritizing pipeline system reviews. Specifically, TSA has not updated its risk assessment methodology since 2014 to reflect current threats to the pipeline industry. Further, its sources of data and underlying assumptions and judgments regarding certain threat and vulnerability inputs are not fully documented. In addition, the risk assessment has not been peer reviewed since its inception in 2007. Taking steps to strengthen its risk assessment, and initiating an independent, external peer review would provide greater assurance that TSA ranks relative risk among pipeline systems using comprehensive and accurate data and methods. TSA has established performance measures to monitor pipeline security review recommendations, analyze their results, and assess effectiveness in reducing risks. However, these measures do not possess key attributes—such as clarity, and having measurable targets—that GAO has found are key to successful performance measures. By taking steps to ensure that its pipeline security program performance measures exhibit these key attributes, TSA could better assess its effectiveness at reducing pipeline systems' security risks. Pipeline Security Branch officials also reported conducting security reviews as the primary means for assessing the effectiveness of TSA's efforts to reduce pipeline security risks. However, TSA has not tracked the status of Corporate Security Review recommendations for the past 5 years. Until TSA monitors and records the status of these reviews' recommendations, it will be hindered in its efforts to determine whether its recommendations are leading to significant reduction in risk. GAO makes 10 recommendations to TSA to improve its pipeline security program management (many are listed on the next page), and DHS concurred. GAO recommends, among other things, that the TSA Administrator take the following actions: implement a documented process for reviewing, and if deemed necessary, for revising TSA's Pipeline Security Guidelines at defined intervals; clarify TSA's Pipeline Security Guidelines by defining key terms within its criteria for determining critical facilities; develop a strategic workforce plan for TSA's Security Policy and Industry Engagement‘s Surface Division; update TSA's pipeline risk assessment methodology to include current data to ensure it reflects industry conditions and threats; fully document the data sources, underlying assumptions and judgments that form the basis of TSA's pipeline risk assessment methodology; take steps to coordinate an independent, external peer review of TSA's pipeline risk assessment methodology; ensure the Security Policy and Industry Engagement‘s Surface Division has a suite of performance measures which exhibit key attributes of successful performance measures; and enter information on Corporate Security Review recommendations and monitor and record their status."], "all_classes": null, "length": 15361}

The report is about the U.S. Department of Defense's global defense posture, specifically in Europe, and the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI). \n\nFirst, the report explains that global defense posture includes forces, footprint, and agreements. EUCOM is responsible for Europe and parts of Asia, and they evaluate the adequacy of posture. The report mentions that since the Cold War, the number of U.S. military sites and personnel in Europe has decreased, and some brigades were deactivated. However, there's a recent effort to increase forces through ERI, which includes rotating armored brigades and improving infrastructure. \n\nThe report also discusses the challenges in estimating the costs of these initiatives. DOD has faced issues with not having comprehensive cost data, leading to recommendations for better cost estimation processes. The ERI is funded through the OCO budget, which is meant for short-term contingency operations, but the report points out that this approach may not be suitable for long-term posture enhancements. \n\nThere are several recommendations made in the report. The first is for the Secretary of Defense to prioritize ERI initiatives relative to those in the base budget using established posture-planning processes. The second recommendation is to have EUCOM and the military services develop estimates for the sustainment costs of prepositioned equipment and infrastructure projects, ensuring these costs are planned into future budgets. The third recommendation is to provide Congress with estimates of future costs for ERI initiatives, including assumptions about host nation support and burden sharing. \n\nThe report also highlights that DOD has not fully estimated the long-term sustainment costs for some ERI initiatives, which could lead to financial risks. Additionally, the lack of future cost estimates for ERI could hinder congressional oversight and decision-making. \n\nThe report concludes with DOD's partial concurrence with the recommendations. They plan to continue using the Global Posture Executive Council for prioritizing ERI initiatives and will use the Strategic Review to guide planning efforts. However, the report suggests that DOD could improve its planning for ERI by using established posture-planning processes, which would help in prioritizing initiatives and managing costs effectively. \n\nI need to condense all this into a one-page summary. Start with the main purpose of the report: evaluating DOD's global defense posture in Europe, particularly under ERI. Mention the three elements of posture: forces, footprint,", "answers": ["In response to Russia's annexation of Crimea in March 2014, the President announced the ERI, to reassure allies in Europe of U.S. commitment to their security. This initiative has been funded using OCO appropriations, which Congress provides in addition to DOD's base budget appropriations. The Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the Continuing Appropriations and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017, included a provision for GAO to review matters related to ERI. In this report, we (1) describe changes in ERI's objectives, funding under ERI, and DOD's posture in Europe since 2014 and (2) evaluate the extent to which DOD's planning processes for posture initiatives funded under ERI prioritize those initiatives, estimate their long-term costs, and communicate their estimated costs to Congress. GAO analyzed DOD strategy documentation, budget and cost analysis guidance, budget justification materials, and cost and obligations data. GAO also interviewed knowledgeable officials within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, U.S. European Command, the military services, and the State Department. Since 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) has expanded the European Reassurance Initiative's (ERI) objectives, increased its funding, and planned enhancements to European posture. DOD expanded ERI's objectives from the short-term reassurance of allies and partners to include deterring Russian aggression in the long term and developing the capacity to field a credible combined force should deterrence fail. With respect to funding, DOD will have requested approximately $4.5 billion for ERI's posture enhancements through the end of fiscal year 2017 (about $3.2 billion for fiscal year 2017 alone), and in July 2016 EUCOM identified funding needs for future posture initiatives. The expansion of ERI's objectives has contributed to DOD's enhancing its posture in Europe. Specifically, DOD has increased the size and duration of Army combat unit deployments, planned to preposition Army equipment in Eastern Europe, added new enduring locations (e.g., locations that DOD expects to access and use to support U.S. security interests for the foreseeable future), improved infrastructure, and negotiated new agreements with European nations. As of April 2017, DOD was considering further force enhancements under ERI as part of the department's ERI budget request. DOD also was reviewing whether new enduring locations to support ERI were needed and was considering other improvements to existing infrastructure. DOD's process for planning ERI has not established priorities among posture initiatives funded under ERI relative to those in its base budget, nor estimated long-term sustainment costs for some posture initiatives funded under ERI, nor communicated future costs to Congress. ERI is being planned using a separate process from DOD's established processes and is funded from DOD's overseas contingency operations (OCO) appropriations. GAO found several weaknesses: Lack of prioritization : DOD establishes priorities among ERI posture initiatives but has not evaluated them against base budget initiatives using its posture management process. As a result, DOD lacks an understanding of the relative importance of ERI initiatives and may be investing in projects that it will not continue should OCO funding become unavailable. Lack of sustainment costs : EUCOM and the military services have not fully estimated the long-term costs to sustain equipment and construction funded under ERI. Based on DOD's approach for calculating rough order sustainment costs, GAO determined that these costs could be substantial. DOD officials said that GAO correctly applied DOD's approach for estimating sustainment costs, but noted that actual costs may be lower, because the military services may not fully fund sustainment. In the absence of comprehensive estimates, DOD has been limited in its ability to assess affordability and plan for future costs. Not communicating future costs : DOD limits Congress's visibility into the resources needed to implement ERI and achieve its objectives because it does not include future costs in its ERI budget request. This is a public version of a classified report issued in August 2017. Information on specific posture planning, guidance, and budget estimates that DOD deemed to be classified have been omitted from this report. GAO recommends that DOD prioritize ERI posture initiatives against initiatives in its base budget, develop cost estimates for sustaining initiatives, and communicate future costs to Congress.

It mentions that spending increased from $146 billion in 2013 to $158 billion in 2015. \n\nThe report also discusses the differences between Medicaid spending on institutional settings like nursing homes versus home and community settings, including assisted living. It notes that state Medicaid programs may cover certain services in assisted living, but not room and board. \n\nCMS and states have roles in overseeing Medicaid. CMS sets regulations, approves changes, provides technical assistance, collects data, and reviews individual state programs. States handle day-to-day administration, including monitoring of HCBS programs. Each state has a designated agency, which may delegate responsibilities to other agencies, but the state is ultimately accountable to the federal government.\n\nThe report highlights that while CMS has requirements for HCBS programs, there's variation in state oversight, especially regarding critical incidents. CMS has added requirements for states to monitor and report on these incidents, but the enforcement is lacking. \n\nThe report also mentions that CMS has taken steps to improve oversight, such as adding new requirements for HCBS waiver applications. However, there are still issues with state reporting, like unclear guidance on deficiencies and lack of annual reports on critical incidents. \n\nThe report concludes with three recommendations for CMS to improve oversight and ensure states are meeting their commitments to protect Medicaid beneficiaries. These include clarifying requirements for reporting deficiencies, establishing standard reporting requirements for critical incidents, and ensuring all states submit annual reports on time.\n\nNow, I need to condense all this into a one-page summary. I should start by outlining the key points: the increase in Medicaid spending on long-term care, the distinction between institutional and community-based services, the role of CMS and states in oversight, the challenges in state oversight of critical incidents, and the recommendations for CMS.\n\nI need to make sure the summary is concise, covers all the main points, and is structured logically. I should avoid too much detail but still convey the essential information. Also, I need to make sure the summary is one page, so I have to be concise and to the point.\n\nLet me start by summarizing the main findings and recommendations.

These settings, which include assisted living facilities, provide a range of services that allow aged and disabled beneficiaries, who might otherwise require nursing home care, to remain in the community. State Medicaid programs and CMS, the federal agency responsible for overseeing the state programs, share responsibility for ensuring that beneficiaries' health and welfare is protected. GAO was asked to examine state and federal oversight of assisted living services in Medicaid. This report (1) describes state spending on and coverage of these services, (2) describes how state Medicaid agencies oversee the health and welfare of beneficiaries in these settings, and (3) examines the extent that CMS oversees state Medicaid agency monitoring of assisted living services. GAO surveyed all state Medicaid agencies and interviewed officials in a nongeneralizeable sample of three states with varied oversight processes for their assisted living programs. GAO reviewed regulations and guidance, and interviewed CMS officials. State Medicaid agencies in 48 states that covered assisted living services reported spending more than $10 billion (federal and state) on assisted living services in 2014. These 48 states reported covering these services for more than 330,000 beneficiaries through more than 130 different programs. Most programs were operated under Medicaid waivers that allow states to target certain populations, limit enrollment, or restrict services to certain geographic areas. With respect to oversight of their largest assisted living programs, state Medicaid agencies reported varied approaches to overseeing beneficiary health and welfare, particularly in how they monitored critical incidents involving beneficiaries receiving assisted living services. State Medicaid agencies are required to protect beneficiary health and welfare and operate systems to monitor for critical incidents—cases of potential or actual harm to beneficiaries such as abuse, neglect, or exploitation. Twenty-six state Medicaid agencies could not report to GAO the number of critical incidents that occurred in assisted living facilities, citing reasons including the inability to track incidents by provider type (9 states), lack of a system to collect critical incidents (9 states), and lack of a system that could identify Medicaid beneficiaries (5 states). State Medicaid agencies varied in what types of critical incidents they monitored. All states identified physical, emotional, or sexual abuse as a critical incident. A number of states did not identify other incidents that may indicate potential harm or neglect such as medication errors (7 states) and unexplained death (3 states). State Medicaid agencies varied in whether they made information on critical incidents and other key information available to the public. Thirty-four states made critical incident information available to the public by phone, website, or in person, while another 14 states did not have such information available at all. Oversight of state monitoring of assisted living services by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is limited by gaps in state reporting. States are required to annually report to CMS information on deficiencies affecting beneficiary health and welfare for the most common program used to provide assisted living services. However, states have latitude in what they consider a deficiency. States also must describe their systems for monitoring critical incidents, but CMS does not require states to annually report data from their systems. Under federal internal control standards, agencies should have processes to identify information needed to achieve objectives and address risk. Without clear guidance on reportable deficiencies and no requirement to report critical incidents, CMS may be unaware of problems. For example, CMS found, after an in-depth review in one selected state seeking to renew its program, that the state lacked an effective system for assuring beneficiary health and welfare, including reporting insufficient information on the number of unexpected or suspicious beneficiary deaths. The state had not reported any deficiencies in annual reports submitted to CMS in 5 prior years. GAO recommendations to CMS include clarifying state requirements for reporting program deficiencies and requiring annual reporting of critical incidents. HHS concurred with GAO's recommendations to clarify deficiency reporting and stated that it would consider annual reporting requirements for critical incidents after completing an ongoing review."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6063}
{"pred": " The report outlines the regulatory frameworks and oversight mechanisms for rail transportation safety in the United States, focusing on the roles of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). FRA oversees the safety of freight railroads and intercity passenger railroads, which operate on the general system of standard-gauge tracks. FTA, on the other hand, regulates rail transit systems that serve individual metropolitan areas, typically using tracks not shared with freight or other passenger trains. The report highlights the importance of rail transit in the nation's transportation network, particularly in large metropolitan areas, where it accounted for 88 percent of passenger trips in 2016. The report also discusses the state safety oversight program, which was established under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, requiring states to designate agencies to oversee rail transit safety. However, limitations have been identified in the state safety oversight program, including insufficient staff and training for state safety agencies. In response, the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 2008 was enacted, which directed FRA to issue new safety regulations for different aspects of railroad safety, such as hours of service requirements for passenger railroad workers, positive train control implementation, track inspection rules, and safety at highway-rail grade crossings. The report also discusses the challenges faced by FRA and FTA in developing and implementing safety regulations, including the need for performance-based regulations that allow for more flexibility in achieving safety goals. The report concludes with two recommendations for FTA to improve its rail transit safety oversight program: (1) the Office of Transit Safety and Oversight should create a plan, with a timeline, for developing guidance for state safety agencies about how to develop and implement a risk-based inspection program, and (2) the Office of Transit Safety and Oversight should develop and communicate a method for how it will monitor the effectiveness of the enforcement authorities and practices of state safety agencies. The report also mentions that the state safety oversight program is currently in transition as the agency implements new authorities and responsibilities provided in federal law. The report emphasizes the need for FTA to provide guidance to state safety agencies on how to develop and implement risk-based inspection programs, as well as how to monitor the effectiveness of their enforcement practices. The report also highlights the importance of FTA's role in ensuring the safety of rail transit systems, particularly in light of the limitations of the state safety oversight program. The report concludes that FTA's approach to rail transit safety oversight is in transition, and that the agency needs to provide more", "answers": ["In 2012 and 2015, DOT was provided with additional authority to oversee the safety of rail transit. Within DOT, FTA is now implementing this authority. The DOT's Office of Inspector General has reported, though, that FTA faces challenges in carrying out its enhanced safety oversight. FRA, also in DOT, has long carried out safety oversight of freight, intercity passenger, and commuter railroads. GAO was asked to review various rail safety and oversight issues, including the differences between FRA's and FTA's rail safety oversight programs. This report examines (1) key characteristics of FRA's and FTA's rail safety oversight programs and (2) strengths and limitations of FRA's and FTA's rail safety oversight programs. GAO assessed FRA's and FTA's information about rail safety oversight activities against guidance from the Office of Management and Budget, leading practices developed by the transit industry, and federal standards for internal control. GAO also interviewed stakeholders, including rail operators chosen based on mode, size, and location. The Department of Transportation's (DOT) Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and Federal Transit Administration (FTA) carry out different approaches to rail safety oversight. FRA has a more centralized safety oversight program for railroads, while FTA's program for oversight of rail transit safety largely relies on state safety agencies to monitor and enforce rail transit safety, as established in federal statute. Key characteristics of both programs include: (1) safety regulations, (2) inspections and other oversight activities, and (3) enforcement mechanisms to ensure that safety deficiencies are addressed (see figure). There are strengths and limitations to FRA's and FTA's approaches to their safety oversight missions, including how the two agencies develop safety regulations, conduct inspections, and carry out enforcement. The National Transportation Safety Board has reported, and stakeholders GAO spoke with generally agreed, that strengths of FRA's rail safety oversight program include its safety regulations, its risk-based inspection program, and its enforcement authorities. FRA also has potential limitations in its oversight framework, though, such as difficulty evaluating the effectiveness of its enforcement mechanisms. FTA has made some progress implementing changes to the rail transit safety program. However, FTA has not provided all the necessary guidance and support to states' safety agencies to ensure they develop appropriate and effective rail transit safety inspection programs. In particular, FTA has not provided states with guidance on how to develop and implement risk-based inspection programs. Though FTA has said that it will develop such guidance, it does not have a plan or timeline to do so. Without guidance from FTA on how to develop and carry out risk-based inspections, state safety agencies may not allocate their limited resources efficiently, and important safety issues may go undetected. In addition, FTA has not developed a process or methodology to evaluate whether state safety agency enforcement authorities and practices are effective. Without clear evidence that state safety agencies' enforcement is effective, states and FTA may not be able to compel rail transit operators to remedy safety deficiencies. As a result, deficiencies may remain for long periods, potentially contributing to safety incidents. GAO recommends that FTA (1) create a plan, with timeline, for developing risk-based inspection guidance for state safety agencies, and (2) develop and communicate a method for how FTA will monitor whether state safety agencies' enforcement practices are effective.

{"pred": " The NASA Commercial Crew Program, initiated in 2010, aims to develop and certify crew transportation systems to ensure continued U.S. access to the International Space Station (ISS). The program has evolved through multiple phases, initially using Space Act agreements that provided flexibility, and later transitioning to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) based contracts to ensure mission procurement. NASA has narrowed the number of participants over time, focusing on Boeing and SpaceX, which have been awarded contracts valued at up to $4.2 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. These contracts include three types of services: design, development, and testing; service missions to the ISS; and special studies and analyses. The program has established a verification closure notice process to ensure contractors meet all requirements before flying initial crewed missions to the ISS. As of April 2018, NASA had funded studies worth approximately $30 million to Boeing and $44 million to SpaceX, with significant portions allocated to additional testing of the parachute system. The contracts are fixed-price, but their values can increase due to NASA's requirement changes. As of April 2018, NASA requirement changes had increased the value of contract line item 001 for Boeing by approximately $191 million and for SpaceX by approximately $91 million. The program divided the certification work under contract line item 001 into two acceptance events: the design certification review and the certification milestone. An acceptance event occurs when NASA approves a contractor’s designs and acknowledges that the contractor’s work is complete and meets the requirements of the contract. The first acceptance event—the design certification review—verifies the contractor’s crew transportation system’s capability to safely approach, dock, mate, and depart from the ISS, among other requirements. After the contractor has successfully completed all of its flight tests, as well as various other activities, the second acceptance event—the certification milestone—determines whether the crew transportation system meets the Commercial Crew Program’s requirements. Following this contract milestone is an agency certification review, which authorizes the use of a contractor’s system to transport NASA crew to and from the ISS. The program has faced significant delays in both Boeing and SpaceX's certification milestones, with Boeing's certification delayed to January 2019 and SpaceX's to February 2019. NASA's schedule risk analysis indicates that further delays are likely, with an average certification date of December 2019 for Boeing and January 2020 for SpaceX. The program has not fully shared information", "answers": ["In 2014, NASA awarded two firm-fixed-price contracts to Boeing and SpaceX, worth a combined total of up to $6.8 billion, to develop crew transportation systems and conduct initial missions to the ISS. In February 2017, GAO found that both contractors had made progress, but their schedules were under mounting pressure. The contractors were originally required to provide NASA all the evidence it needed to certify that their systems met its requirements by 2017. A House report accompanying H.R. 5393 included a provision for GAO to review the progress of NASA's human exploration programs. This report examines the Commercial Crew Program, including (1) the extent to which the contractors have made progress towards certification and (2) how NASA's certification process addresses safety of the contractors' crew transportation systems. GAO analyzed contracts, schedules, and other documentation and spoke with officials from NASA, the Commercial Crew Program, Boeing, SpaceX, and two of NASA's independent review bodies that provide oversight. Both of the Commercial Crew Program's contractors, Boeing and Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX), are making progress finalizing designs and building hardware for their crew transportation systems, but both contractors continue to delay their certification milestone (see figure). Certification is the process that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will use to ensure that each contractor's system meets its requirements for human spaceflight for the Commercial Crew Program. Further delays are likely as the Commercial Crew Program's schedule risk analysis shows that the certification milestone is likely to slip. The analysis identifies a range for each contractor, with an earliest and latest possible completion date, as well as an average. The average certification date was December 2019 for Boeing and January 2020 for SpaceX, according to the program's April 2018 analysis. Since the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011, the United States has been relying on Russia to carry astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS). Additional delays could result in a gap in U.S. access to the space station as NASA has contracted for seats on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft only through November 2019. NASA is considering potential options, but it does not have a contingency plan for ensuring uninterrupted U.S. access. NASA's certification process addresses the safety of the contractors' crew transportation systems through several mechanisms, but there are factors that complicate the process. One of these factors is the loss of crew metric that was put in place to capture the probability of death or permanent disability to an astronaut. NASA has not identified a consistent approach for how to assess loss of crew. As a result, officials across NASA have multiple ways of assessing the metric that may yield different results. Consequently, the risk tolerance level that NASA is accepting with loss of crew varies based upon which entity is presenting the results of its assessment. Federal internal controls state that management should define risk tolerances so they are clear and measurable. Without a consistent approach for assessing the metric, the agency as a whole may not clearly capture or document its risk tolerance with respect to loss of crew. GAO is making five recommendations, including that NASA develop a contingency plan for ensuring a U.S. presence on the ISS and clarify how it will determine its risk tolerance for loss of crew. NASA concurred with three recommendations; partially concurred on the recommendation related to loss of crew; and non-concurred with a recommendation to report its schedule analysis to Congress. GAO believes these recommendations remain valid, as discussed in the report."], "all_classes": null, "length": 9763}

The report is about the appointment processes for various legislative branch agencies and entities. There are eight agencies mentioned, each with different appointment methods. Some are appointed by the President with Senate approval, others by Congress, the Librarian of Congress, or a board of directors. The report also discusses legislative attempts to reform these appointment processes, including proposals to remove the President from the appointment process for certain positions. There are mentions of the Appointments Clause, the definition of an \"officer of the United States,\" and the implications of changing appointing authorities. The report also covers specific agencies like the Architect of the Capitol, the Comptroller General, the Government Publishing Office, the Library of Congress, the Congressional Budget Office, the Congressional Research Service, and the Office of Compliance.

It highlights the inherent risks of banking, such as credit risk and the potential for bank panics, which can lead to significant economic losses. The report outlines the development of a regulatory system aimed at balancing the benefits of banking with the risks, and how both banks and regulations have evolved in response to changing market conditions and emerging risks.\n\nThe 2007-2009 financial crisis had a profound impact on the financial system, threatening total collapse. The crisis revealed serious weaknesses in the pre-crisis regulatory regime, leading to significant government interventions. In response, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010, which aimed to strengthen regulation and address risks. Additionally, U.S. bank regulators have implemented changes under their existing authorities, many of which adhere to the Basel III Accords—an international framework for bank regulation agreed to by U.S. and international bank regulators—that called for making certain bank regulations more stringent.\n\nIn the aftermath of the crisis, some observers raised concerns that the potential benefits of those regulatory changes (e.g., better-managed risks, increased consumer protection, greater systemic stability, potentially higher economic growth over the long term) were outweighed by the potential costs (e.g., compliance costs incurred by banks, reduced credit availability for consumers and businesses, potentially slower economic growth). In response to these concerns, Congress passed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCP Act; P.L. 115-174 ). Among other things, the law modified certain (1) regulations facing small banks; (2) regulations facing banks large enough to be subjected to Dodd-Frank enhanced regulation but still below the size thresholds exceeded by the very largest banks; and (3) mortgage regulations facing lenders including banks. In addition, federal banking regulatory agencies—the Federal Reserve (the Fed), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)—have proposed further changes in regulation.\n\nThe report also discusses the impact of market trends and economic conditions on the banking industry, including the development of new technologies used in financial services (known as \"fintech\") and a rising interest rate environment following an extraordinarily long period of very low rates.\n\nThe report provides an overview of selected banking-related issues, including those related to \"safety and soundness\" regulation,", "answers": ["Regulation of the banking industry has undergone substantial changes over the past decade. In response to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, many new bank regulations were implemented pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act; P.L. 111-203) or under the existing authorities of bank regulators to address apparent weaknesses in the regulatory regime. While some observers view those changes as necessary and effective, others argued that certain regulations were unjustifiably burdensome. To address those concerns, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-174) relaxed certain regulations. Opponents of that legislation argue it unnecessarily pared back important safeguards, but proponents of deregulation argue additional pare backs are needed. Meanwhile, a variety of economic and technological trends continue to affect banks. As a result, the 116th Congress faces many issues related to banking, including the following: Safety and Soundness. Banks are subject to regulations designed to reduce the likelihood of bank failures. Examples include requirements to hold a certain amount of capital (which enables a bank to absorb losses without failing) and the so-called Volcker Rule (a ban on banks' proprietary trading). In addition, anti-money laundering requirements aim to reduce the likelihood banks will execute transactions involving criminal proceeds. Banks are also required to take steps to avoid becoming victims of cyberattacks. The extent to which these regulations (i) are effective, and (ii) appropriately balance benefits and costs is a matter of debate. Consumer Protection, Fair Lending, and Access to Banking. Certain laws are designed to protect consumers and ensure that lenders use fair lending practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has authorities to regulate for consumer protection. No consensus exists on whether current regulations strike an appropriate balance between protecting consumers while ensuring access to credit and justifiable compliance costs. In addition, whether Community Reinvestment Act regulations as currently implemented effectively and efficiently encourage banks to provide services in their areas of operation is an open question. Large Banks and \"Too Big To Fail.\" Regulators also regulate for systemic risks, such as those associated with very large and complex financial institutions that may contribute to systemic instability. Dodd-Frank Act provisions include enhanced prudential regulation for certain large banks and changes to resolution processes in the event one fails. In addition, bank regulators imposed additional capital requirements on certain large, complex banks. Subsequently, some argued that certain of these additional regulations were too broadly applied and overly stringent. In response, Congress reduced the applicability of the Dodd-Frank measures and regulators have proposed changes to the capital rules. Whether relaxing these rules will provide needed relief to these banks or unnecessarily pare back important safeguards is a debated issue. Community Banks. The number of small or \"community\" banks has declined substantially in recent decades. No consensus exists on the degree to which regulatory burden, market forces, and the removal of regulatory barriers to interstate branching and banking are causing the decline. What Companies Should Be Eligible for Bank Charters. To operate legally as a bank, an institution must hold a charter granted by a state or federal government. Traditionally, these are held by companies generally focused on and led by people with experience in finance. However, recently companies with a focus on technology are interested in having legal status as a bank, either through a charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or a state-level industrial loan company charter. Policymakers disagree over whether allowing these companies to operate as banks would create appropriately regulated providers of financial services or inappropriately extend government-backed bank safety nets and disadvantage existing banks. Recent Market and Economic Trends. Changing economic forces also pose issues for the banking industry. Some observers argue that increases in regulation could drive certain financial activities into a relatively lightly regulated \"shadow banking\" sector. Innovative financial technology may alter the way certain financial services are delivered. If interest rates rise, it could create opportunities and risks. Such trends could have implications for how the financial system performs and influence debates over appropriate banking regulations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12828}

The conflict, which began in the 1940s with the formation of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) from peasant self-defense groups, was marked by significant human rights violations, including killings, kidnappings, forced displacements, and land mine casualties. The conflict resulted in the deaths of approximately 220,000 Colombians, with 81% being civilians, and caused significant displacement, with over 5 million Colombians displaced due to land seizure and violence. The conflict also led to the deaths or amputees from anti-personnel land mines laid primarily by the FARC. The conflict has had a significant impact on Colombian society, with over 8 million Colombians, or roughly 15% of the population, having registered as conflict victims. The conflict has been a major cause of a massive displacement of the civilian population, which has many societal consequences, including implications for Colombia's poverty levels and stability. Colombia has experienced a significant turnaround, with the country overcoming much of the violence that had clouded its future. Colombia's economy has grown, with the country becoming one of Latin America's most attractive locations for foreign direct investment. However, the economy has faced challenges, with Colombia's GDP growth slowing to 3.1% in 2015 and declining to 1.7% in 2017.

Drug trafficking fueled the violence by funding both left-wing and right-wing armed groups. Some analysts feared Colombia would become a failed state in the late 1990s, but the Colombian government devised a new security strategy, known as Plan Colombia, to counter the insurgencies. Originally designed as a 6-year program, Plan Colombia ultimately became a 17-year U.S.-Colombian bilateral effort. The partnership focused initially on counternarcotics and later on counterterrorism; it then broadened to include sustainable development, human rights, trade, regional security, and many other areas of cooperation. Between FY2000 and FY2016, the U.S. Congress appropriated more than $10 billion to help fund Plan Colombia and its follow-on programs. For FY2018, Congress appropriated $391.3 million in foreign aid for Colombia, including assistance to promote peace and end the conflict. President Juan Manuel Santos (2010-2018) made concluding a peace accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)—the country's largest leftist guerrilla organization—his government's primary focus. Following four years of formal peace negotiations, Colombia's Congress ratified the FARC-government peace accord in November 2016. During a U.N.-monitored demobilization effort in 2017, approximately 11,000 FARC disarmed and demobilized. This figure included FARC who had been held in prison for crimes of rebellion and those making up FARC militias, who were accredited by the Colombian government as eligible to demobilize. On August 7, 2018, Iván Duque, a senator from the conservative Democratic Center party, was inaugurated to a four-year presidential term. Duque, who also worked at the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington, DC, and is Colombia's youngest president in a century, campaigned as a critic of the peace accord with the FARC. His party objected to specific measures concerning justice and political representation. Some observers maintain that his election has generated uncertainty for implementation of the accord. Shortly after taking office, Duque suspended peace talks with the National Liberation Army (ELN), the country's second-largest rebel group, which had begun under President Santos. Since the ratification of the peace accord, Colombia's long-term strategy has evolved from defeating insurgents to post-conflict stabilization. Many considered Plan Colombia and its successor strategies a remarkable advance, given the country's improvements in security and economic stability. Nevertheless, recent developments have called into question Colombia's progress. The FARC's demobilization has triggered open conflict among armed actors (including FARC dissidents and transnational criminal groups), which seek to control drug cultivation and trafficking, illegal mining, and other illicit businesses that the demobilized FARC abandoned. The ongoing lack of governance in remote rural areas recalls the conditions that originally gave rise to the FARC and other armed groups. Many observers continue to raise concerns about the country's human-rights conditions, sharp increases in coca cultivation and cocaine production, and problems stemming from the failing authoritarian government of neighboring Venezuela, which shares a nearly 1,400-mile border with Colombia. Venezuela's humanitarian crisis has set in motion an exodus of migrants, many of whom have sought temporary residence (or extended stays) in Colombia. Political upheaval has added yet more uncertainty after the United States and many other Western Hemisphere and European nations, including Colombia, called for a democratic transition in Venezuela and recognized the president of the Venezuelan National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, as the country's interim president in January 2019. The U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement went into force in May 2012. The United States remains Colombia's top trade partner.

The goal was to create a competitive environment for the U.S. commercial space industry. The act also provided government protection against some losses, known as indemnification, while minimizing taxpayer costs.\n\nThe FAA issues licenses for commercial launches and reentries, and these licenses are covered by federal indemnification for third-party damages. The report mentions that in 2016, the FAA issued five active licenses with an average MPL of about $51 million. The MPL is the amount of insurance required, which is intended to reflect the greatest dollar amount of loss to third parties and the federal government for bodily injury and property damage that can be reasonably expected from a launch or reentry accident.\n\nThe FAA calculates separate MPL values for potential damages to third parties and the federal government. For third parties, the MPL is based on a 1 in 10 million chance of occurring, while for the federal government, it's based on a 1 in 100,000 chance. These thresholds are meant to estimate the federal government's exposure to losses above the MPL, ensuring that losses are very unlikely to exceed the insurance coverage and become potential costs for the government under the CSLCA.\n\nThe report discusses the FAA's process for determining the MPL value, which includes three elements: number of casualties, cost of casualties, and property damage. The number of casualties is estimated by adding direct and secondary casualties. Direct casualties include serious injuries and deaths, while secondary casualties include those from fires and collapsing buildings. The cost of casualties is calculated by multiplying the number of estimated casualties by $3 million, which is the average loss per casualty. Property damage is estimated by applying a predetermined factor (changed from 50% to 25%) to the estimated cost of casualties. The total MPL is the sum of the estimated cost of casualties and property damage.\n\nThe FAA", "answers": ["The federal government shares liability risks with the commercial space launch industry for accidents that result in damages to third parties or federal property. This arrangement requires space launch companies to have a specific amount of insurance to cover these damages. The government is potentially liable for damages above that amount, up to a cap GAO estimated to be $3.1 billion in 2017, subject to appropriations in advance. CSLCA, enacted in 2015, directed the Department of Transportation, of which FAA is a part, to evaluate its MPL methodology and, if necessary, develop a plan to update that methodology. The act also included a provision requiring GAO to assess FAA's evaluation and any actions needed to update the methodology. This report discusses the extent to which (1) FAA's evaluation report addresses the requirements in CSLCA and (2) FAA has addressed previously identified weaknesses in the MPL methodology. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed FAA on its loss methodology evaluation and actions to address weaknesses. The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) report evaluating its maximum probable loss (MPL) methodology did not fully address the evaluation and consultation requirements specified by the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act (CSLCA). Balance of Risk. CSLCA required FAA to include ensuring that the federal government is not exposed to greater indemnification costs and that launch companies are not required to purchase more insurance coverage than necessary as a result of FAA's MPL methodology. FAA said that it ensured this balance by improving its methodology, but it did not reevaluate its probability thresholds after revising its methodology. These thresholds are used to divide the risk of loss between launch companies and the government. Impact on Costs. The act required FAA to consider the costs to both the industry and the federal government of implementing an updated methodology. FAA's report discussed the impact on indirect costs, such as data collection, but did not discuss direct costs: insurance premiums for launch companies and indemnification liability for the federal government. Consultation. The act also required FAA to consult with the commercial space sector and insurance providers in evaluating its MPL methodology in accordance with the preceding requirements. While the agency consulted with some stakeholders, these consultations were limited in scope. FAA officials said they have not been able to take the actions needed to fully satisfy the mandated elements because of issues such as resource limitations and the lack of available data. However, by not resolving these issues, FAA lacks assurance that launch companies are not purchasing more insurance than needed or that the federal government is not being exposed to greater indemnification costs than expected. FAA has addressed two of three previously identified weaknesses in its MPL methodology but has not yet dealt with the remaining weakness. Specifically, the agency has revised its methodology for estimating the number of potential casualties for a launch and changed the factor it uses to derive estimated property damage from estimated casualties. However, FAA has not updated the amount used for the cost of an individual casualty. GAO recommended in a March 2017 report (GAO-17-366) that FAA update this amount. Not doing so could understate the amount of insurance launch companies are required to purchase, exposing the federal government to excess risk. GAO also determined that while FAA has two tools and methods it can use in making its MPL estimates, it does not have guidance on determining which are most appropriate for a given launch scenario. For example, one tool is more comprehensive but also labor intensive to use, while the other is inappropriate for certain launch scenarios and could result in misleading MPL amounts. Officials said they have begun to create such guidance but do not have an estimated completion date. Without such guidance, FAA cannot ensure that the most appropriate MPL methodology is used for each launch. FAA should fully address mandated requirements in evaluating its MPL—probability thresholds, direct costs, and stakeholder consultations— and establish an estimated completion date for developing guidance on tools and methods to use for specific launch scenarios. The Department of Transportation concurred with the recommendations, and provided technical comments."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4125}

Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points. \n\nThe report starts by describing the Coast Guard's structure, including its large staff, fleet of aircraft and vessels, and the geographic divisions. It mentions that the Coast Guard has 11 statutory missions under the Homeland Security Act, managed through six mission programs. For example, marine safety involves inspections and investigations, especially for commercial fishing vessels, which have a high fatality rate. \n\nThe Coast Guard has set performance goals for each mission, but there are issues with the data used to measure these goals. For instance, the data on commercial fishing vessel accidents is incomplete, making it hard to track trends. The report also points out that the Coast Guard's asset performance data is not realistic, as some assets are aging and require more maintenance than planned. \n\nThere are recommendations to improve data completeness, use more realistic asset performance data, and enhance the transparency of performance goals. The Coast Guard has agreed to some of these, like developing new data fields and working with stakeholders. However, there are ongoing issues with data reliability and the need for better capital planning. \n\nThe report also mentions that the Coast Guard's Annual Performance Report hasn't been publicly released since 2011, which limits transparency. There are concerns about the affordability of modernizing their fleet, as they acquire new vessels without long-term planning. \n\nThe summary needs to be concise, covering the structure, missions, performance goals, data issues, recommendations, and the Coast Guard's responses. I should highlight the main points without getting too detailed. Also, make sure to mention the need for transparency and the challenges in data collection and asset management. \n\nI need to structure the summary into a few paragraphs. Start with an overview of the Coast Guard's structure and missions. Then discuss the performance goals and the data issues. Mention the recommendations and the Coast Guard's responses. Finally, touch on the transparency issues and the need for long-term planning. \n\nI should avoid technical jargon and keep the summary clear and to the point. Make sure each paragraph flows logically, and the key findings are highlighted. Also, check that the summary is within one page, so I need to be concise but comprehensive.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of the Coast Guard report.

To ensure that the Coast Guard is effectively fulfilling its missions, agency managers must have accurate information and base decisions on sound analyses for effective program management. This statement discusses Coast Guard actions needed to (1) improve the quality of data used for program management and (2) improve the transparency of its data for reporting on mission performance and planning. This statement is based on relevant products GAO issued from June 2014 through December 2017 on Coast Guard strategic planning and management issues, as well as related recommendation follow-up conducted through February 2018. GAO reviewed applicable laws, regulations, policies and guidance. GAO also interviewed Coast Guard officials responsible for administering these programs and obtained information on how they used data to inform decisionmaking. GAO interviewed a range of stakeholders, including federal and industry officials. GAO's prior work recommended multiple actions to improve the Coast Guard's program management by improving the quality of data it uses to manage and report on its mission performance. Specifically, GAO recommended actions such as collecting more complete data and clarifying the data limitations to facilitate more effective program management. For example, in December 2017, GAO found that more information is needed to calculate vessel safety statistics that could enhance the Coast Guard's knowledge about accident, injury, and fatality trends involving commercial fishing vessels. Having more complete information could be useful to carrying out its marine safety mission, and GAO recommended, among other things, that the Coast Guard ensure that data collected during commercial fishing vessel incident investigations is accurately captured. In 2018, the Coast Guard reported taking initial steps to capture more accurate data. GAO's prior work also identified areas where the Coast Guard could improve the transparency of the data it uses for reporting on its mission performance as well its capital planning purposes. For example, in an October 2017 report on performance goals, GAO found the Coast Guard's Annual Performance Report (APR) has not been released publicly since 2011. Consequently, there has not been full visibility over performance across all of the Coast Guard's missions. Coast Guard officials stated that a decision by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership to limit the number of performance goals shared publicly had deterred the Coast Guard from public release of its APR. GAO recommended that APRs be available on the Coast Guard's website; the Coast Guard plans to publicly release future APRs. In addition, previous GAO reports found that the Coast Guard's annual 5-year capital investment plan, which projects acquisition funding needs for the upcoming 5 years, did not consistently reflect current total cost estimates or the effects of tradeoffs made as part of the annual budget cycle. GAO made recommendations to help the Coast Guard plan for future acquisitions and the difficult trade off decisions it will face given funding constraints. The Coast Guard agreed, but it is unclear when it will complete the 20-year plan. GAO is not making new recommendations in this statement but has made them to the Coast Guard and DHS in the past on improving its program management through, among other things, better quality and more transparent data.

{"pred": " The report discusses the history and current state of federal small business contracting programs in the United States. It begins by explaining how these programs were established in 1953 with the passage of the Small Business Act, which created the Small Business Administration (SBA) to promote the interests of small businesses and preserve free competitive enterprise. The report outlines the SBA's various programs, including loan guaranty and venture capital programs to enhance small business access to capital; contracting programs to increase small business opportunities in federal contracting; direct loan programs for businesses, homeowners, and renters to assist their recovery from natural disasters; and small business management and technical assistance training programs to assist business formation and expansion. The report also discusses the various federal requirements and authorities in promoting contracting and subcontracting with small businesses, including the requirement that federal agencies generally reserve contracts that have an anticipated value greater than the micro-purchase threshold (currently $10,000) but not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $250,000) exclusively for small businesses unless the contracting officer is unable to obtain offers from two or more small businesses that are competitive with market prices and the quality and delivery of the goods or services being purchased. The report also discusses the establishment of small business procurement goals, both government-wide and agency specific, to promote the awarding of contracts to small businesses. The report highlights the SBA's oversight and responsibilities concerning the small business goaling program, small business mentor-protégé programs, the 7(j) management and technical assistance program, and the surety bond guaranty program. It also discusses the role of the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU), located in each federal agency, in promoting contracting with small businesses, and examines the role and responsibilities of various federal procurement officers, including procurement center representatives, commercial market representatives, and business opportunity specialists, in promoting small business contracting opportunities. The report concludes with a discussion of the strong bipartisan support for small business contracting programs, but also notes that these programs face opposition and issues regarding their impact and operations. The report also outlines the various federal programs, requirements, procurement officers, and procurement offices involved in promoting federal contracting and subcontracting with small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs), SDBs participating the SBA's \"8(a) Program,\" Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) small businesses, women-owned small businesses (WOSBs), and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs", "answers": ["Congress has broad authority to impose requirements upon the federal procurement process, that is, the process whereby agencies obtain goods and services from the private sector. One way in which Congress has exercised this authority is by adopting measures to promote contracting and subcontracting between \"small businesses\" and federal agencies. These measures, among other things, declare a congressional policy of ensuring that a \"fair proportion\" of federal contract and subcontract dollars is awarded to small businesses; establish government-wide and agency-specific goals for the percentage of federal contract and subcontract dollars awarded to small businesses; establish an annual Small Business Goaling Report to measure progress in meeting these goals; generally require federal agencies, under specified circumstances, to reserve contracts that have an anticipated value greater than the micro-purchase threshold (currently $10,000), but not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $250,000) exclusively for small businesses; authorize federal agencies, under specified circumstances, to set aside contracts that have an anticipated value greater than the simplified acquisition threshold exclusively for small businesses; authorize federal agencies to make sole source awards to small businesses when the award could not otherwise be made (e.g., only a single source is available, under urgent and compelling circumstances); authorize federal agencies to set aside contracts for, or grant other contracting preference to, specific types of small businesses (e.g., 8(a) small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, women-owned small businesses (WOSBs) and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs)); and task the Small Business Administration (SBA) and other federal procurement officers with reviewing and restructuring proposed procurements to maximize opportunities for small business participation. Small business contracting programs generally have strong bipartisan support. However, that does not mean that these programs face no opposition, or that issues have not been raised concerning the impact and operations of specific programs. For example, small business advocates note that implementing regulations in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) narrow the reach (and impact) of some small business contracting preferences by excluding specific types of contracts, such as those listed in the Federal Supply Schedules, from FAR requirements pertaining to small business contracting. Advocates want the federal government to enact policies that reduce or eliminate such exclusions. Critics have questioned some of these programs' effectiveness, in terms of both promoting small business opportunities to win federal contracts and promoting a more diversified, robust economy. Many observers judge the relative success or failure of federal efforts to enhance small business contracting opportunities by whether federal government and individual federal agencies meet the predetermined procurement goals in the annual Small Business Goaling Report. In recent years, the federal government has generally succeeded in meeting the government-wide goals of awarding 23% of the total value of all small business eligible prime contract awards to small businesses, 5% to small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs), and 3% to SDVOSBs. It has had difficulty meeting the goals of 5% to WOSBs and 3% to HUBZone small businesses. The Small Business Goaling Report is the most convenient measure available to compare federal small business contracting performance over time, but it has limitations. For example, the SBA excludes some contracts from the report in its determination of what is \"small business eligible\" and some federal procurement activities are not included because they are not recorded in the Federal Procurement Data System—Next Generation. It also does not evaluate the effect these contracts have on small businesses, industry competitiveness, or the overall economy."], "all_classes": null, "length": 9547}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe LWCF was established in 1965 with the goal of preserving and developing outdoor recreation resources. Its main purposes are to facilitate recreation participation and improve public health. The fund receives $900 million annually, mostly from oil and gas leases on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), motorboat fuel tax, and surplus property sales. However, these funds are only available if Congress appropriates them through the discretionary process. There's also the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA) which adds mandatory funds (not needing annual appropriation) for state outdoor recreation grants. \n\nThe total revenues since the fund's start are $40.9 billion, but only $18.9 billion has been appropriated through FY2019, leaving an unappropriated balance of $22.0 billion. The law specifies that at least 40% of the funds go to federal purposes (like land acquisition) and 40% to state grants. \n\nOver the years, the fund has been used for three main purposes: federal land acquisition (for agencies like BLM, FWS, NPS, FS), state grant programs (helping states with recreation planning, land acquisition, facilities), and other purposes. The other purposes have varied, with some years seeing higher allocations for specific programs. \n\nFrom FY1998 to FY2019, $2.7 billion was allocated for other purposes. The largest share went to the Forest Legacy Program ($1.4 billion) and the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund ($1.0 billion). Other programs like State and Tribal Wildlife Grants have also received funding. \n\nThere have been debates about expanding the use of LWCF funds beyond land acquisition and state grants. Some argue that using the funds for other purposes could lead to less funding for the original goals. However, some members of Congress and stakeholders have supported funding other purposes to align with policy priorities or to shift the focus of the fund. \n\nThe report also discusses the history of appropriations for other purposes, noting that the amount and percentage have varied widely. For example, in FY2001, the appropriation for other purposes was $456 million, which was part of the Lands Legacy Initiative. In contrast, in FY1999, no", "answers": ["The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Act of 1965 (P.L. 88-578) created the LWCF in the Treasury as a funding source to implement the outdoor recreation goals set out by the act. The LWCF Act authorizes the fund to receive $900 million annually, with the monies available only if appropriated by Congress (i.e., discretionary appropriations). The fund also receives mandatory appropriations under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA). The level of annual appropriations for the LWCF has varied since the origin of the fund in FY1965. The LWCF Act outlines uses of the fund for federal and state purposes. Of the total made available through appropriations or deposits under GOMESA, not less than 40% is to be used for \"federal purposes\" and not less than 40% is to be used to provide \"financial assistance to states.\" The act lists the federal purposes for which the President is to allot LWCF funds \"unless otherwise allotted in the appropriation Act making them available.\" These purposes primarily relate to acquisition of lands and waters (and interests therein) by the federal government. With regard to state purposes, the act authorizes a matching grant program to states for outdoor recreation purposes. Throughout the LWCF's history, appropriations acts typically have provided funds for land acquisition and outdoor recreational grants to states. Beginning in FY1998, appropriations also have been provided each year (except FY1999) to fund other purposes related to natural resources. The extent to which the LWCF should be used for purposes other than federal land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants to states, and which other purposes should be funded from the LWCF, continue to be the subject of legislation and debate in Congress. In the past few decades, Presidents have sought LWCF funds for a variety of other purposes. Congress chooses which if any of these requests to fund, and has chosen programs not sought by the President for a particular year. Among other programs, appropriations have been provided for facility maintenance of the land management agencies, ecosystem restoration, the Historic Preservation Fund, the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, the Forest Legacy Program, State and Tribal Wildlife Grants (under the Fish and Wildlife Service), the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, U.S. Geological Survey science and cooperative programs, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Indian Land and Water Claim Settlements. Since FY1998, a total of $2.7 billion has been appropriated for other purposes, of a total LWCF appropriation of $18.9 billion over the history of the fund. The Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service have received the largest shares of the total appropriations for other purposes, about $1.4 billion (53%) and $1.0.billion (38%), respectively, from FY1998 to FY2019. Several agencies shared the remaining $0.2 billion (9%) of the appropriations. Both the dollar amounts and the percentages of annual LWCF appropriations for other purposes have varied widely since FY1998. The dollar amounts have ranged from $0 in FY1999 to $456.0 million in FY2001. The percentage of annual funds provided for other purposes ranged from 0% in FY1999 to a high of 59% in both FY2006 and FY2007. In some years, the appropriation for other purposes was significantly less than the Administration requested. For instance, for FY2008, the George W. Bush Administration sought $313.1 million; the appropriation was $101.3 million. The appropriation for other purposes last exceeded $100.0 million in FY2010, and most recently was $93.3 million, in FY2019. Prior to FY2008, several other purposes typically were funded each year from LWCF. Since FY2008, funds have been appropriated annually only for grants under two programs: Forest Legacy and Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund.

{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report to understand the main points. The report is about the U.S. Navy's readiness issues, including mishaps, maintenance problems, and challenges with overseas homeports.\n\nFirst, the report mentions four significant mishaps since 2017, resulting in damage and 17 sailor deaths. Three of these involved ships in Yokosuka, Japan. The Navy has 277 ships now, down from 1998. They've kept around 100 ships deployed overseas, leading to more deployments per ship. This has caused low readiness levels, with longer deployments for carriers, cruisers, etc. For example, carrier strike groups went from 6.4 months to 9 months in 2015. The Navy extended deployments in 2016. They also cut training and maintenance periods, leading to declining ship conditions and longer maintenance times. This cycle compresses training and operational time.\n\nThe Navy has increased the number of ships homeported overseas, from 20 in 2006 to 40 today, with more planned. However, this leads to higher operational and support costs. The operational schedules for overseas ships limit dedicated training and maintenance periods, resulting in crews not being fully trained and ships not being properly maintained. The primary reason overseas ships have more deployed time is that the Navy reduces training and maintenance periods to maximize operational availability. These ships don't follow traditional fleet response plan cycles, which include ramp-up and ramp-down periods. Instead, they have more frequent, shorter maintenance periods or defer maintenance until after returning to a U.S. homeport, which can be 7-10 years later. This has led to a \"train on the margins\" approach where crews train while underway or in limited time between periods. As a result, crews in Japan had expired certifications, with a fivefold increase since 2015. The Navy's Surface Force Readiness Manual states that high operational tempo requires ships to be prepared for complex operations, which means maintaining maximum training, material condition, and manning readiness. However, the report found that casualty reports nearly doubled from 2009-2014, and the condition of overseas ships decreased faster than U.S.-based ships. This indicates a worsening material condition, which affects the Navy's ability to", "answers": ["Since January 2017, the Navy has suffered four significant mishaps at sea that resulted in serious damage to its ships and the loss of 17 sailors. Three of these incidents involved ships homeported in Japan. In response to these incidents, the Chief of Naval Operations ordered an operational pause for all fleets worldwide, and the Vice Chief of Naval Operations directed a comprehensive review of surface fleet operations, stating that these tragic incidents are not limited occurrences but part of a disturbing trend in mishaps involving U.S. ships. This statement provides information on the effects of homeporting ships overseas, reducing crew size on ships, and not completing maintenance on time on the readiness of the Navy and summarizes GAO recommendations to address the Navy's maintenance, training, and other challenges. In preparing this statement, GAO relied on work it has published since 2015 related to the readiness of ships homeported overseas, sailor training and workload issues, maintenance challenges, and other issues. GAO updated this information, as appropriate, based on Navy data. GAO's prior work shows that the Navy has increased deployment lengths, shortened training periods, and reduced or deferred maintenance to meet high operational demands, which has resulted in declining ship conditions and a worsening trend in overall readiness. The Navy has stated that high demand for presence has put pressure on a fleet that is stretched thin across the globe. Some of the concerns that GAO has highlighted include: Degraded readiness of ships homeported overseas: Since 2006, the Navy has doubled the number of ships based overseas. Overseas basing provides additional forward presence and rapid crisis response, but GAO found in May 2015 that there were no dedicated training periods built into the operational schedules of the cruisers and destroyers based in Japan. As a result, the crews of these ships did not have all of their needed training and certifications. Based on updated data, GAO found that, as of June 2017, 37 percent of the warfare certifications for cruiser and destroyer crews based in Japan—including certifications for seamanship—had expired. This represents more than a fivefold increase in the percentage of expired warfare certifications for these ships since GAO's May 2015 report. The Navy has made plans to revise operational schedules to provide dedicated training time for overseas-based ships, but this schedule has not yet been implemented. Crew size reductions contribute to sailor overwork and safety risks: GAO found in May 2017 that reductions to crew sizes the Navy made in the early 2000s were not analytically supported and may now be creating safety risks. The Navy has reversed some of those changes but continues to use a workweek standard that does not reflect the actual time sailors spend working and does not account for in-port workload—both of which have contributed to some sailors working over 100 hours a week. Inability to complete maintenance on time: Navy recovery from persistently low readiness levels is premised on adherence to maintenance schedules. However, in May 2016, GAO found that the Navy was having difficulty completing maintenance on time. Based on updated data, GAO found that, in fiscal years 2011 through 2016, maintenance overruns on 107 of 169 surface ships (63 percent) resulted in 6,603 lost operational days (i.e., the ships were not available for training and operations). Looking to the future, the Navy wants to grow its fleet by as much as 30 percent but continues to face challenges with manning, training, and maintaining its existing fleet. These readiness problems need to be addressed and will require the Navy to implement GAO's recommendations—particularly in the areas of assessing the risks associated with overseas basing, reassessing sailor workload and the factors used to size ship crews, managing investments to modernize and improve the efficiency of the naval shipyards, and applying sound planning and sustained management attention to its readiness rebuilding efforts. In addition, continued congressional oversight will be needed to ensure that the Navy demonstrates progress in addressing its maintenance, training, and other challenges. GAO made 14 recommendations in prior work cited in this statement. The Department of Defense generally concurred with all of them but has implemented only 1. Continued attention is needed to ensure that these recommendations are addressed, such as the Navy assessing the risks associated with overseas basing and reassessing sailor workload and factors used in its manpower requirements process."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3534}
{"pred": " The report discusses the concept of the digital economy and its implications for international tax policy, particularly in Europe. The digital economy encompasses various economic activities that are connected through computers, mobile phones, or other internet-connected devices. In the realm of international tax policy, certain types of activities and markets have been singled out for selective taxation by some jurisdictions, primarily in Europe. These digital economy business models operate in \"two-sided markets\" where they provide services to individual users (sometimes at zero charge) and sell other services to businesses (e.g., advertising to users). Proponents of these \"digital services taxes\" (DSTs) justify them on a number of grounds, including the goal of having multinational corporations (MNCs) pay their \"fair share\" of taxes, taxing profits purportedly derived from consumers in their jurisdictions, or adapting traditional rules and systems of international taxation to account for new forms of \"disruptive\" business models that can be conducted virtually over the internet. U.S. opposition to these unilateral taxes has been voiced by several government officials. Robert Stack, while Treasury Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Tax Affairs under President Obama, said that such efforts are primarily political efforts to target U.S. corporations. More recently, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has issued multiple statements in opposition to unilateral taxation of digital economy businesses. Some Members of the tax-writing committees in Congress have also criticized these efforts. This report analyzes DST proposals from an economic and policy perspective as they have been introduced, discussed, and adapted in European countries. Some commentators and policymakers argue that MNCs in the digital economy are \"undertaxed\" or are not paying a \"fair share\" of taxes in their jurisdictions. Two issues that often underlie these sentiments are (1) the ability of digital economy MNCs to provide services without establishing a physical presence (or \"permanent establishment\") in the country in which their customers reside and (2) the ability of digital economy MNCs to shift their profits away from countries where they conduct real economy activity (e.g., sales, development, production) toward low-tax jurisdictions where the MNCs are conducting little to no real economic activity. Even if a country is able to establish the right to tax an MNC's profits in the digital economy (via permanent establishment rules), the profits subject to tax in that jurisdiction could be reduced via transfer pricing rules. A commonly held principle across international tax law is that there must be a substantial enough connection between a country and a corporation's activities to establish \"nexus\" in that country", "answers": ["Several countries, primarily in Europe, and the European Commission have proposed or adopted taxes on revenue earned by multinational corporations (MNCs) in certain \"digital economy\" sectors from activities linked to the user-based activity of their residents. These proposals have generally been labeled as \"digital services taxes\" (DSTs). For example, beginning in 2019, Spain is imposing a DST of 3% on online advertising, online marketplaces, and data transfer service (i.e., revenue from sales of user activities) within Spain. Only firms with €750 million in worldwide revenue and €3 million in revenues with users in Spain are to be subject to the tax. In 2020, the UK plans to implement a 3% DST that would apply only to businesses whose revenues exceed £25 million per year and groups that generate global revenues from search engines, social media platforms, and online marketplaces in excess of £500 million annually. The UK labels its DST as an \"interim\" solution until international tax rules are modified to allow countries to tax the profits of foreign MNCs if they have a substantial enough \"digital presence\" based on local users. The member states of the European Commission are also actively considering such a rule. These policies are being considered and enacted against a backdrop of ongoing, multilateral negotiations among members and nonmembers of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). These negotiations, prompted by discussions of the digital economy, could result in significant changes for the international tax system. Proponents of DSTs argue that digital firms are \"undertaxed.\" This sentiment is driven in part by some high-profile tech companies that reduced the taxes they paid by assigning ownership of their income-producing intangible assets (e.g., patents, marketing, and trade secrets) to affiliate corporations in low-tax jurisdictions. Proponents of DSTs also argue that the countries imposing tax should be entitled to a share of profits earned by digital MNCs because of the \"value\" to these business models made by participation of their residents through their content, reviews, purchases, and other contributions. Critics of DSTs argue that the taxes target income or profits that would not otherwise be subject to taxation under generally accepted income tax principles. U.S. critics, in particular, see DSTs as an attempt to target U.S. tech companies, especially as minimum thresholds are high enough that only the largest digital MNCs (such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon) will be subject to these specific taxes. DSTs are structured as a selective tax on revenue (akin to an excise tax) and not as a tax on corporate profits. A tax on corporate profits taxes the return to investment in the corporate sector. Corporate profit is equal to total revenue minus total cost. In contrast, DSTs are \"turnover taxes\" that apply to the revenue generated from taxable activities regardless of costs incurred by a firm. Additionally, international tax rules do not allow countries to tax an MNC's cross-border income solely because their residents purchase goods or services provided by that firm. Rather, ownership of assets justifies a country to be allocated a share of that MNC's profits to tax. Under these rules and their underlying principles, the fact that a country's residents purchase digital services from an MNC is not a justification to tax the MNC's profits. DSTs are likely to have the economic effect of an excise tax on intermediate services. The economic incidence of a DST is likely to be borne by purchasers of taxable services (e.g., companies paying digital economy firms for advertising, marketplace listings, or user data) and possibly consumers downstream from those transactions. As a result, economic theory and the general body of empirical research on excise taxes predict that DSTs are likely to increase prices in affected markets, decrease quantity supplied, and reduce investment in these sectors. Compared to a corporate profits tax—which, on balance, tends to be borne by higher-income shareholders—DSTs are expected to be more regressive forms of raising revenue, as they affect a broad range of consumer goods and services. Certain design features of DSTs could also create inequitable treatment between firms and increase administrative complexity. For example, minimum revenue thresholds could be set such that primarily large, foreign (and primarily U.S.) corporations are subject to tax. Requirements to identify the location of users could also introduce significant costs on businesses. This report traces the emergence of DSTs from multilateral tax negotiations in recent years, addresses various purported policy justifications of DSTs, provides an economic analysis of their effects, and raises several issues for Congress."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12505}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about commercial disclosure requirements and the First Amendment. Let me start by understanding the key points of the report.\n\nThe report discusses how the First Amendment applies to laws that require commercial actors to disclose certain information to consumers. It mentions that while the First Amendment protects the right to speak and the right not to speak, the government can't compel speech in most cases. However, there are exceptions, especially with commercial speech, which is regulated more freely.\n\nThe Supreme Court has different standards for evaluating these disclosure requirements. The report explains that commercial speech is protected but not as much as other types of speech. The Court has upheld some disclosure requirements that target conduct and only incidentally burden speech. However, if the disclosure requirement regulates \"speech as speech,\" it might be subject to either intermediate scrutiny or a more lenient standard, like rational basis review, if it fits the Zauderer case.\n\nThe Zauderer case is important because it allowed certain disclosures that were factual and uncontroversial, even though they involved commercial speech. The Court said that in such cases, the government's interest in preventing deception was sufficient, and the disclosure requirement was reasonably related to that interest. However, the Court also warned that unjustified or unduly burdensome disclosure requirements might violate the First Amendment by chilling protected commercial speech.\n\nThe report also discusses the different levels of scrutiny: strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, and the Zauderer standard. It mentions that the Supreme Court has not always applied the same standard to all commercial disclosure requirements, and that some recent cases suggest that disclosure requirements may be subject to heightened scrutiny.\n\nThe report also discusses the distinction between laws that regulate conduct and those that regulate speech. The Court has held that conduct-focused regulations will not violate the First Amendment by merely incidentally burdening speech. However, in the context of compelled disclosure requirements, the Court has been more skeptical, especially in recent years.\n\nThe report outlines the three main categories of First Amendment analysis that may apply to commercial disclosure requirements: strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, and the Zauderer standard. It explains that the Zauderer standard is the most lenient and applies when the disclosure requirement is for factual and uncontroversial information related to the goods or services being sold. However, if the disclosure requirement is not for such information, then the Court may apply a more stringent standard, like Central Hudson or even strict scrutiny.\n\nThe report also discusses the implications of the Supreme Court's recent decisions, such as NIFLA", "answers": ["Federal law contains a wide variety of disclosure requirements, including food labels, securities registrations, and disclosures about prescription drugs in direct-to-consumer advertising. These disclosure provisions require commercial actors to make statements that they otherwise might not, compelling speech and implicating the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. Nonetheless, while commercial disclosure requirements may regulate protected speech, that fact in and of itself does not render such provisions unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has historically allowed greater regulation of commercial speech than of other types of speech. Since at least the mid-1970s, however, the Supreme Court has been increasingly protective of commercial speech. This trend, along with other developments in First Amendment law, has led some commentators to question whether the Supreme Court might apply a stricter test in assessing commercial disclosure requirements in the near future. Nonetheless, governing Supreme Court precedent provides that disclosure requirements generally receive lesser judicial scrutiny when they compel only commercial speech, as opposed to noncommercial speech. In National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra, a decision released in June 2018, the Supreme Court explained that it has applied a lower level of scrutiny to compelled disclosures under two circumstances. First, the Supreme Court has sometimes upheld laws that regulate commercial speech if the speech regulation is part of a larger regulatory scheme that is focused on conduct and only incidentally burdens speech. If a law is properly characterized as a regulation of conduct, rather than speech, then it may be subject to rational basis review, a deferential standard that asks only whether the regulation is a rational way to address the problem. However, it can be difficult to distinguish speech from conduct, and the Supreme Court has not frequently invoked this doctrine to uphold laws against First Amendment challenges. Second, the Supreme Court has sometimes applied a lower level of scrutiny to certain commercial disclosure requirements under the authority of a 1985 case, Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel. In Zauderer, the Court upheld a disclosure requirement after noting that the challenged provision compelled only \"factual and uncontroversial information about the terms under which . . . services will be available.\" The Court said that under the circumstances, the service provider's First Amendment rights were sufficiently protected because the disclosure requirement was \"reasonably related\" to the government's interest \"in preventing deception of consumers.\" Lower courts have generally interpreted Zauderer to mean that if a commercial disclosure provision requires only \"factual and uncontroversial information\" about the goods or services being offered, it should be analyzed under rational basis review. If a commercial disclosure requirement does not qualify for review under Zauderer, then it will most likely be analyzed under the intermediate standard that generally applies to government actions that regulate commercial speech. Some legal scholars have argued that recent Supreme Court case law suggests the Court may subject commercial disclosure provisions to stricter scrutiny in the future, either by limiting the factual circumstances under which these two doctrines apply or by creating express exceptions to these doctrines. If a court applies a heightened level of scrutiny, it may require the government to present more evidence of the problem it is seeking to remedy and stronger justifications for choosing a disclosure requirement to achieve its purposes."], "all_classes": null, "length": 9534}

The report is about the United States' involvement in Afghanistan's security and governance, specifically since 2001. The key missions mentioned are the counterterrorism mission led by the U.S. and the NATO-led Resolute Support mission. The goal of Resolute Support is to build self-sustaining Afghan security ministries and forces. \n\nThe report mentions that the security situation has deteriorated since the 2015 transition to Afghan-led security. There were 24,000 security incidents in 2017, which is the highest recorded. Even in 2018, there were challenges like high-casualty attacks in urban areas and coordinated attacks on ANDSF checkpoints. \n\nThe U.S. is contributing significantly to these missions, with 54% of the Resolute Support military personnel as of May 2018. The funding for the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund in fiscal year 2018 was about $4.67 billion. Other international donors provided around $800 million, and the Afghan government committed about $500 million. \n\nThe report discusses the structure of the ANDSF, which includes the Afghan National Army (ANA) and Afghan National Police (ANP). The ANA has specialized forces like the Afghan Special Security Forces, while the ANP includes units like the Afghan Border Police. The report also mentions the different levels of advising, such as ministerial and regional advisors, and the specialized forces like the Afghan Air Force and Special Security Forces. \n\nThe ANDSF has made some progress in certain areas, such as operational planning and coordination between ministries. However, there are still capability gaps, especially in logistics, intelligence, and equipment sustainment. The Afghan Special Security Forces are more capable and can operate independently, while the ANA and ANP still rely on coalition support. \n\nThe report also talks about the U.S. and coalition efforts to address these gaps, such as the ANDSF Roadmap, which aims to improve fighting capabilities, leadership development, unity of command, and counter-corruption efforts. There are also initiatives like the National Maintenance Strategy Ground Vehicle Support contract, which aims to build the capacity of ANDSF and Afghan contractors to take control of vehicle maintenance over a 5-year period. \n\nAdditionally, the U.S. has deployed a Security Force Assistance Brigade to provide", "answers": ["Developing independently capable ANDSF is a key component of U.S. and coalition efforts to create sustainable security and stability in Afghanistan under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)-led Resolute Support mission. The United States is the largest contributor of funding and personnel to Resolute Support, providing and maintaining ANDSF equipment, along with training, advising, and assistance to help the ANDSF effectively use and sustain the equipment in the future. House Report 114-537 included a provision for GAO to review the ANDSF's capability and capacity to operate and sustain U.S.-purchased weapon systems and equipment. This report addresses (1) what has been reported about ANDSF capabilities and capability gaps and (2) the extent to which DOD has information about the ANDSF's ability to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment. To conduct this work, GAO analyzed DOD and NATO reports and documents, examined three critical equipment types, and interviewed DOD officials in the United States and Afghanistan. This is a public version of a sensitive report issued in September 2018. Information that DOD deemed sensitive has been omitted. Since the Resolute Support mission began in 2015, the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) have improved some fundamental capabilities, such as high-level operational planning, but continue to rely on U.S. and coalition support to fill several key capability gaps, according to Department of Defense (DOD) reporting. DOD has initiatives to address some ANDSF capability gaps, such as a country-wide vehicle maintenance and training effort, but DOD reports it does not expect the ANDSF to develop and sustain independent capabilities in some areas, such as logistics, for several years. While DOD has firsthand information on the abilities of the Afghan Air Force and Special Security Forces to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment, it has little reliable information on the equipment proficiency of conventional ANDSF units. U.S. and coalition advisors are embedded at the tactical level for the Air Force and Special Security Forces, enabling DOD to directly assess those forces' abilities. However, the advisors have little direct contact with conventional ANDSF units on the front lines. As a result, DOD relies on those units' self-assessments of tactical abilities, which, according to DOD officials, can be unreliable. GAO's analysis of three critical equipment types illustrated the varying degrees of DOD's information (see figure above). For example, DOD provided detailed information about the Air Force's ability to operate and maintain MD-530 helicopters and the Special Security Forces' ability to operate and maintain Mobile Strike Force Vehicles; however, DOD had limited information about how conventional forces operate and maintain radios and Mobile Strike Force Vehicles. DOD's lack of reliable information on conventional forces' equipment operations and maintenance abilities adds to the uncertainty and risk in assessing the progress of DOD efforts in Afghanistan. GAO recommends that DOD develop options for collecting reliable information on conventional ANDSF units' ability to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment.

{"pred": " The report discusses the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), which provides federal funding to states to improve their child protective service systems. CAPTA requires states to submit plans outlining how they will use the funds, and these plans must be updated as needed. States are also required to submit annual data reports on their responses to child abuse and neglect referrals, as well as preventive services provided to families. The report highlights the challenges states face in implementing CAPTA, particularly in relation to substance-affected infants. Since 2003, governors have had to provide assurances that states have policies and procedures to address the needs of infants affected by prenatal substance abuse or displaying withdrawal symptoms at birth. These policies require health care providers to notify CPS of such infants, and governors must assure that a plan of safe care is developed for these infants. The report also discusses the impact of the opioid epidemic on the number of substance-affected infants, noting a significant increase in the rate of Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS). The report outlines the requirements for health care providers to notify CPS about substance-affected infants, including the need for states to have laws or policies that require such notifications. It also discusses the challenges states face in defining \"substance-affected\" and the implications of these definitions on their policies and procedures. The report highlights the need for additional guidance and technical assistance from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to help states better understand and implement CAPTA requirements. The report concludes that without additional guidance, states may struggle to provide adequate protections and services for vulnerable infants and their families.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points. The report is about the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), which provides grants to states to improve their child protective service systems. The main points seem to be the requirements for states to submit plans and data reports, the challenges in implementing these requirements, especially regarding substance-affected infants, and the need for more guidance from HHS.\n\nFirst, I should outline the structure of the summary. It should start with an introduction about CAPTA, its purpose, and the funding. Then, mention the requirements for state plans and annual data reports. Next, discuss the challenges states face, such as defining \"substance-affected\" and the impact of the opioid epidemic. Then, talk about the need for additional guidance and technical assistance from HHS. Finally, conclude with the report's recommendation and", "answers": ["Under CAPTA, states perform a range of prevention activities, including addressing the needs of infants born with prenatal drug exposure. The number of children under the age of 1 entering foster care increased by about 15 percent from fiscal years 2012 through 2015. Child welfare professionals attribute the increase to the opioid epidemic. GAO was asked to examine the steps states are taking to implement CAPTA requirements on substance-affected infants and related amendments enacted in 2016. This report examines (1) the extent to which states have adopted policies and procedures to notify CPS of substance-affected infants; (2) state efforts to develop plans of safe care, and associated challenges; and (3) steps HHS has taken to help states implement the provisions. To obtain this information, GAO surveyed state CPS directors in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and reached a 100 percent response rate. GAO also visited 3 states (Kentucky, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania); reviewed relevant documents such as federal laws and regulations, and HHS guidance; and interviewed HHS officials. GAO did not assess states' compliance with CAPTA requirements. All states reported adopting, to varying degrees, policies and procedures regarding health care providers notifying child protective services (CPS) about infants affected by opioids or other substances. Under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), as amended, governors are required to provide assurances that the states have laws or programs that include policies and procedures to address the needs of infants affected by prenatal substance use. This is to include health care providers notifying CPS of substance-affected infants. In response to GAO's survey, 42 states reported having policies and procedures that require health care providers to notify CPS about substance-affected infants and 8 states reported having policies that encourage notification. The remaining 1 state has a policy requiring health care providers to assess the needs of mothers and infants and if they conclude that infants are at risk for abuse or neglect, CPS is notified. In response to GAO's survey, 49 states reported that their CPS agency has policies to develop a plan of safe care; 2 reported not having such a requirement. Under CAPTA, states are required to develop a plan of safe care for substance-affected infants. Although not defined in law, a plan of safe care generally entails an assessment of the family's situation and a plan for connecting families to appropriate services to stabilize the family and ensure the child's safety and well-being. States reported that plans typically address the infant's safety needs, immediate medical needs, and the caregiver's substance use treatment needs. However, officials in the 3 states GAO visited noted challenges, including uncertainty about what to include in plans and the level of intervention needed for infants at low risk of abuse or neglect. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has provided technical assistance and guidance to states to implement these CAPTA requirements. Most states reported in GAO's survey that additional guidance and assistance would be very or extremely helpful for addressing their challenges. Nevertheless, HHS officials told GAO that the agency does not anticipate issuing additional written guidance, but that states can access technical assistance through their regional offices and the National Center on Substance Abuse and Child Welfare—a resource center funded by HHS. However, of the 37 states that reported on the helpfulness of the assistance they have received, 19 said it was only moderately helpful to not helpful. States offered suggestions for improving the assistance, such as developing substance abuse training materials for staff and holding video conferences with other states to share information. In October 2017, HHS officials explained that some states have submitted plans that include details on how they are addressing the CAPTA requirements. HHS officials reported that some of the plans submitted to date indicated that states are not meeting the requirements and those states have been asked to develop program improvement plans. Without more specific guidance and assistance to enhance states' understanding of CAPTA requirements and better address known challenges such as the ones described in this report, states may miss an opportunity to provide more effective protections and services for the children and families most in need.

Much of this assistance is provided in areas plagued by conflict or other issues that increase the risk of financial crimes. The World Bank and others have reported that humanitarian assistance organizations face challenges in accessing banking services that could affect project implementation. GAO was asked to review the possible effects of decreased banking access for nonprofit organizations on the delivery of U.S. humanitarian assistance. In this report, GAO examines (1) the extent to which State and USAID partners experienced banking access challenges, (2) USAID partners' reporting on such challenges, and (3) actions U.S. agencies have taken to help address such challenges. GAO selected four high-risk countries—Syria, Somalia, Haiti, and Kenya—based on factors such as their inclusion in multiple financial risk-related indices, and selected a non-generalizable sample of 18 projects in those countries. GAO reviewed documentation and interviewed U.S. officials and the 18 partners for the selected projects. Implementing partners (partners) for 7 of 18 Department of State (State) and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) humanitarian assistance projects that GAO selected noted encountering banking access challenges, such as delays or denials in transferring funds overseas. Of those 7 projects, 1 partner told us that banking access challenges adversely affected its project and 2 additional partners told us that the challenges had the potential for adverse effects. Moreover, the majority of partners (15 out of 18) for the 18 projects noted experiencing banking access challenges on their global portfolio of projects over the previous 5 years. USAID's partners' written reports do not capture potential risks posed by banking access challenges because USAID generally does not require most partners to report in writing any challenges that do not affect implementation. Six of the 7 projects that encountered challenges were USAID-funded. Of those 6 USAID projects, 5 partners told us that these challenges did not rise to the threshold of affecting project implementation that would necessitate reporting, and 1 did not report challenges although its project was adversely affected. Additionally, GAO's review of about 1,300 USAID partner reports found that the few instances where challenges were mentioned lacked sufficient detail for GAO to determine their type, severity, or origin. Without information on banking access challenges that pose potential risks to project implementation, USAID is not aware of the full extent of risks to achieving its objectives. The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and State have taken various actions to help address banking access challenges encountered by nonprofit organizations (NPO), but USAID's efforts have been limited. Treasury's efforts have focused on engagement between NPOs and U.S. agencies, while State has issued guidance on the topic to its embassies and designated an office to focus on these issues. In contrast, USAID lacks a comparable office, and NPOs stated that it is difficult to find USAID staff to engage with on this topic. Further, GAO found that awareness of specific challenges was generally limited to USAID staff directly overseeing the project. Without communicating these challenges to relevant parties, USAID may not be aware of all risks to agency objectives and may not be able to effectively engage with external entities on efforts to address these challenges. GAO recommends that USAID should take steps to (1) collect information on banking access challenges experienced by USAID's partners and (2) communicate that information both within USAID and with external entities, such as other U.S. agencies and partners.

{"pred": " The Department of Defense (DOD) has established the Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) to support military families with special needs. The program is designed to provide assistance to these families during their frequent relocations, which occur every 3 years for most services and every 4 years for the Air Force. The EFMP has three main components: identification and enrollment, assignment coordination, and family support. Each service is responsible for implementing its own EFMP, with the Office of Special Needs (OSN) overseeing the policy. The report highlights the challenges in ensuring consistent family support services across the services, including variations in the frequency of contact with families, availability of legal assistance, and development of services plans. The report also discusses the lack of common performance metrics to measure the effectiveness of the EFMP and the need for a systematic process to evaluate the results of the services’ monitoring activities. The report concludes with three recommendations for the DOD: (1) to assess the extent to which each service is providing sufficient resources for an appropriate number of family support providers and developing services plans for each family with special needs; (2) to develop common performance metrics for assignment coordination and family support; and (3) to implement a systematic process for evaluating the results of monitoring activities conducted by each service’s EFMP. The report also includes data from fiscal year 2016, which shows the number of families with special needs enrolled in the EFMP, the number of family support providers, and the number of services plans created for these families. The report found that the number of services plans was relatively low compared to the number of families enrolled in the EFMP. The report also discusses the efforts by OSN to standardize the services provided by the EFMP, including the development of new family member travel screening forms and a DOD-wide customer service satisfaction survey. However, the report notes that DOD has not yet developed common metrics for measuring progress in standardizing assignment coordination and family support procedures for families with special needs and assessing the Services’ performance of these processes. The report concludes that without these common metrics, DOD is unlikely to fully determine whether its long-standing efforts to improve support for families with special needs are being implemented as intended. The report also highlights the importance of federal agencies engaging in large projects using performance metrics to determine how well they are achieving their goals and to identify areas for improvement.

This report examines the extent to which (1) each Service provides family support and (2) the Services monitor and DOD evaluates assignment coordination and family support. GAO analyzed DOD and Service-specific EFMP guidance and documents; analyzed fiscal year 2016 EFMP data (the most recent available); visited seven military installations, selected for their large numbers of military-connected students; and interviewed officials responsible for implementing each Service's EFMP, as well as officials in OSN that administer DOD's EFM policy. The support provided to families with special needs through the Department of Defense's (DOD) Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) varies widely for each branch of Military Service. Federal law requires DOD's Office of Special Needs (OSN) to develop a uniform policy that includes requirements for (1) developing and updating a services plan for each family with special needs and (2) resources, such as staffing, to ensure an appropriate number of family support providers. OSN has developed such a policy, but DOD relies on each Service to determine its compliance with the policy. However, Army and Navy officials said they have not received feedback from OSN about the extent to which their Service-specific guidance complies. Federal internal control standards call for developing clear policies to achieve agency goals. In addition, DOD's most recent annual reports to Congress do not indicate the extent to which each Service provides services plans or allocates sufficient resources for family support providers. According to GAO's analysis, the Military Services have developed relatively few services plans, and there is wide variation in the number of family support providers employed, which raises questions about potential gaps in services for families with special needs (see table). Each Service uses various mechanisms to monitor how servicemembers are assigned to installations (assignment coordination) and obtain family support, but DOD has not established common performance measures to assess these activities. DOD has taken steps to better support families with special needs, according to the DOD officials GAO interviewed. For example, DOD established a working group to identify gaps in services. However, OSN officials said that DOD lacks common performance measures for assignment coordination and family support because the Services have not reached consensus on what those measures should be. In addition, OSN does not have a process to systematically evaluate the results of the Services' monitoring activities. Federal internal control standards call for assessing performance over time and evaluating the results of monitoring activities. Without establishing common performance measures and assessing monitoring activities, DOD will be unable to fully determine the effect of its efforts to better support families with special needs and the adequacy of the Services' EFMPs as required by federal law. GAO makes a total of three recommendations to DOD. DOD should assess and report to Congress on the extent to which each Service provides sufficient family support personnel and services plans, develop common performance metrics for assignment coordination and family support, and evaluate the results of the Services' monitoring activities.

{"pred": " The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a large, deployable space telescope designed to succeed the Hubble Space Telescope. It is intended to operate in an orbit approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth, with a 6.5-meter primary mirror, providing about 100 times the sensitivity of Hubble. The telescope is designed to observe very faint infrared sources, requiring extremely cold temperatures, which are maintained by a multi-layered sunshield. The project is divided into three segments: observatory, ground, and launch. The observatory includes the Optical Telescope Element (OTE), Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM), and spacecraft, along with major subsystems like the sunshield and cryocooler. The OTIS (OTE + ISIM) is a key component. The project relies on software for deployment and control, and for data collection and transmission. The development involves NASA, contractors, and international partners. Northrop Grumman is the primary contractor, responsible for the sunshield, OTE, spacecraft, and the Mid-Infrared Instrument’s cryocooler, as well as integrating and testing the observatory. The Space Telescope Science Institute (STSCI) is responsible for soliciting and evaluating research proposals, receiving and storing scientific data, and developing the ground system. The telescope will be launched on an Ariane 5 rocket provided by the European Space Agency. The project has faced numerous technical and workmanship issues, leading to significant schedule delays and cost overruns. These issues have been addressed through a combination of lower-level component tests, ambient deployment tests, and detailed analysis and simulations. The project has a history of significant schedule delays and cost growth, which resulted in replans in 2011 and 2018. The JWST program underwent a replan in September 2011 and a rebaseline in November of that same year, and Congress placed an $8 billion cap on the formulation and development costs for the project. The program’s life-cycle cost estimate was $8.835 billion, including additional money for operations and a planned launch in October 2018. Congress also required that NASA treat any cost increase above the cap according to procedures established for projects that exceed their development cost estimates by at least 30 percent. This process is known as a rebaseline. Congress must authorize continuation of the JWST program if formulation and development costs increase over the $8 billion cost cap.

The project has delayed its planned launch three times since September 2017 due to problems discovered in testing. In June 2018, NASA approved new cost and schedule estimates for JWST. Since the project established its cost and schedule baselines in 2009, the project's costs have increased by 95 percent and the launch date has been moved back by 81 months. Conference Report No. 112-284, accompanying the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012, included a provision for GAO to assess the project annually and report on its progress. This is the seventh report. This report assesses (1) the considerations NASA took into account when updating the project's cost and schedule commitments and (2) the extent to which NASA has taken steps to improve oversight and performance of JWST, among other issues. GAO reviewed relevant NASA policies, analyzed NASA and contractor data, and interviewed NASA and contractor officials. In June 2018, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) revised the cost and schedule commitments for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to reflect known technical challenges, as well as provide additional time to address unanticipated challenges. For example, the revised launch readiness date of March 2021 included 5.5 months to address a design issue for the cover of the sunshield (see image). The purpose of the sunshield is to protect the telescope's mirrors and instruments from the sun's heat. NASA found that hardware on the cover came loose during testing in April 2018. The new cost estimate of $9.7 billion is driven by the schedule extension, which requires keeping the contractor's workforce on board longer than expected. Before the project enters its final phase of integration and test, it must conduct a review to determine if it can launch within its cost and schedule commitments. As part of this review, the project is not required to update its joint cost and schedule confidence level analysis—an analysis that provides the probability the project can meet its cost and schedule commitments—but government and industry cost and schedule experts have found it is a best practice to do so. Such analysis would provide NASA officials with better information to support decisions on allocating resources, especially in light of the project's recent cost and schedule growth. NASA has taken steps to improve oversight and performance of JWST, and identified the JWST project manager as responsible for monitoring the continued implementation of these changes. Examples of recent changes include increasing on-site presence at the contractor facility and conducting comprehensive audits of design processes. Sustaining focus on these changes through launch will be important if schedule pressures arise later and because of past challenges with communications. GAO will follow up on the project's monitoring of these improvements in future reviews. GAO recommends NASA update the project's joint cost and schedule confidence level analysis.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this detailed report about U.S. child nutrition programs. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points.\n\nThe report begins by explaining that child nutrition programs are managed by the USDA-FNS and include several initiatives like the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), School Breakfast Program (SBP), Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP), and the Special Milk Program (SMP). These programs aim to provide meals to children in various settings, including schools and child care. The report also mentions the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA), which was the last reauthorization of these programs. Some of the authorities from HHFKA expired in 2015, but the programs continued with annual appropriations. \n\nIn the 114th Congress, there were attempts to reauthorize the programs, but the legislation didn't pass. The 115th Congress didn't have significant reauthorization efforts, but the 2018 farm bill included some provisions related to child nutrition. The report discusses various issues that have come up in the context of these programs, such as the nutritional content of foods served in schools, the sourcing of foods domestically, access to meals, and the issue of unpaid meal costs. \n\nThe HHFKA introduced new nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods, which were later modified through various regulations. These changes included increasing the amount of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, limiting calories and sodium, and restricting milk to low-fat or fat-free varieties. However, some schools faced challenges in implementing these standards, such as difficulty in obtaining certain products, student acceptance, and increased costs. \n\nThe report also covers the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), which allows schools with high numbers of eligible students to provide free meals to all students. This has increased participation and reduced stigma. However, there are data issues for other programs that rely on meal eligibility data. \n\nOther topics include the implementation of the Community Eligibility Provision, the issue of unpaid meal costs and lunch shaming, and the paid lunch equity requirements. The report also discusses the 2018 farm bill's provisions related to these programs. \n\nThe summary needs to be concise, covering the main points: the various child nutrition programs, the HHFKA and its impact, the reauthorization efforts in Congress, the changes in nutrition standards, the issues with implementation, the Community Eligibility Provision, the unpaid", "answers": ["The term child nutrition programs refers to several U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service (USDA-FNS) programs that provide food for children in institutional settings. These include the school meals programs—the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program—as well as the Child and Adult Care Food Program, Summer Food Service Program, Special Milk Program, and Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program. The most recent child nutrition reauthorization, the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA; P.L. 111-296), made a number of changes to the child nutrition programs. In some cases, these changes spurred debate during the law's implementation, particularly in regard to updated nutrition standards for school meals and snacks. On September 30, 2015, some of the authorities created by the HHFKA expired. Efforts to reauthorize the child nutrition programs in the 114th Congress, while not completed, considered several related issues and prompted further discussion about the programs. There were no substantial reauthorization attempts in the 115th Congress. Current issues discussed in this report include the following: Nutrition standards for school meals and snacks. The HHFKA required USDA to update the nutrition standards for school meals and other foods sold in schools. USDA issued final rules on these standards in 2012 and 2016, respectively. Some schools had difficulty implementing the nutrition standards, and USDA and Congress have taken actions to change certain parts of the standards related to whole grains, sodium, and milk. Offerings in the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP). There have been debates recently over whether the FFVP should include processed and preserved fruits and vegetables, including canned, dried, and frozen items. Currently, statute permits only fresh offerings. \"Buy American\" requirements for school meals. The school meals programs' authorizing laws require schools to source foods domestically, with some exceptions, under Buy American requirements. Efforts both to tighten and loosen these requirements have been made in recent years. The enacted 2018 farm bill (P.L. 115-334) instructed USDA to \"enforce full compliance\" with the Buy American requirements and report to Congress within 180 days of enactment. Congregate feeding in summer meals. Under current law, children must consume summer meals on-site. This is known as the \"congregate feeding\" requirement. Starting in 2010, Congress funded demonstration projects, including the Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) demonstration, to test alternatives to congregate feeding in summer meals. Congress has increased funding for Summer EBT in recent appropriations cycles and there have been discussions about whether to continue or expand the program. Implementation of the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP). The HHFKA created CEP, an option for qualifying schools, groups of schools, and school districts to offer free meals to all students. Because income-based applications for school meals are no longer required in schools adopting CEP, its implementation has created data issues for federal and state programs relying on free and reduced-price lunch eligibility data. Unpaid meal costs and \"lunch shaming.\" The issue of students not paying for meals and schools' handling of these situations has received increasing attention. Some schools have adopted what some term as \"lunch shaming\" practices, including throwing away a student's selected hot meal and providing a cold meal alternative when a student does not pay. Congress and USDA have taken actions recently to reduce instances of student nonpayment and stigmatization. Paid lunch pricing. One result of new requirements in the HHFKA was price increases for paid (full price) lunches in many schools. Attempts have been made—some successfully—to loosen these \"paid lunch equity\" requirements in recent years."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5157}

However, the plan has struggled with underfunding, employer withdrawals, and market downturns, which have contributed to its deteriorating financial condition.\n\nCSPF is one of the largest multiemployer pension plans, with over 385,000 participants as of 2016. However, the number of active participants has declined over time, with only 16 percent of participants being active in 2016. This decline has been exacerbated by the loss of major contributing employers, such as United Parcel Service (UPS), which left the plan in 2007. The loss of UPS, combined with the 2008 market downturn, significantly reduced the plan's assets and increased the unfunded liability.\n\nThe plan's financial condition has been further complicated by the structure of multiemployer pension plans, which are often underfunded due to a combination of investment losses, insufficient employer contributions, and industry-specific risks.

CSPF is one of the nation's largest multiemployer defined benefit pension plans, covering about 385,000 participants. Since 1982, the plan has operated under a court-enforceable consent decree which, among other things, requires that the plan's assets be managed by independent parties. Within 7 years, CSPF estimates that the plan's financial condition will require severe benefit cuts. GAO was asked to review the events and factors that led to the plan's critical financial status and how its investment outcomes compare to similar plans. GAO describes (1) what is known about the factors that contributed to CSPF's critical financial condition; (2) what has been CSPF's investment policy, and the process for setting and executing it, since the consent decree was established; and (3) how CSPF's investments have performed over time, particularly compared to similar pension plans. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations; interviewed CSPF representatives, International Brotherhood of Teamsters officials and members, federal officials, and knowledgeable industry stakeholders; reviewed CSPF documentation including investment policy statements and board of trustee meeting minutes; and analyzed investment returns and fees from required, annual pension plan filings and from consultant benchmarking reports. The Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund (CSPF) was established in 1955 to provide pension benefits to trucking industry workers, and is one of the largest multiemployer plans. According to its regulatory filings, CSPF had less than half the estimated funds needed to cover plan liabilities in 1982 at the time it entered into a court-enforceable consent decree that provides for oversight of certain plan activities. Since then, CSPF has made some progress toward achieving its targeted level of funding; however, CSPF has never been more than 75 percent funded and its funding level has weakened since 2002, as shown in the figure below. Stakeholders GAO interviewed identified numerous factors that contributed to CSPF's financial condition. For example, stakeholders stated that changes within the trucking industry as well as a decline in union membership contributed to CSPF's inability to maintain a healthy contribution base. CSPF's active participants made up about 69 percent of all participants in 1982, but accounted for only 16 percent in 2016. The most dramatic change in active participants occurred in 2007 when the United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) withdrew from the plan. At that time, UPS accounted for about 30 percent of the plan's active participants (i.e. workers). In addition, the market declines of 2001 to 2002 and 2008 had a significant negative impact on the plan's long-term investment performance. Stakeholders noted that while each individual factor contributed to CSPF's critical financial condition, the interrelated nature of the factors also had a cumulative effect on the plan's financial condition. Both CSPF's investment policy and the process for setting and executing it have changed several times since the consent decree was established in 1982. The original consent decree gave an independent asset manager—called a named fiduciary—exclusive authority to set and change the plan's investment policies and manage plan assets, and prohibited CSPF trustees from managing assets or making investment decisions. Initially, the named fiduciaries sold the troubled real estate assets acquired during the pre-consent decree era. Subsequent changes include the following: In 1993, the named fiduciaries started to increase investment in equities, and their policies continued to direct that asset allocations be weighted toward equities until early 2017. Between 2003 and 2010, the court approved three plan decisions to move a total of 50 percent of CSPF's assets into passively-managed accounts (passive management typically seeks to match the performance of a specific market index and reduce investment fees). An early-2017 investment policy change precipitated by CSPF's deteriorating financial condition will continue to move plan assets into fixed income investments ahead of projected insolvency, or the date when CSPF is expected to have insufficient assets to pay promised benefits when due. As a result, assets will be gradually transitioned from “return-seeking assets”—such as equities and emerging markets debt—to high-quality investment grade debt and U.S. Treasury securities with intermediate and short-term maturities. The plan is projected to become insolvent on January 1, 2025. CSPF officials and named fiduciary representatives said these changes are intended to reduce the plan's exposure to market risk and volatility, and provide participants greater certainty prior to projected insolvency. GAO found that CSPF's investment returns and expenses were generally in line with similarly sized institutional investors and with demographically similar multiemployer pension plans. For example, GAO's analysis of returns using the peer group measure used by CSPF known as the Wilshire Associates' Trust Universe Comparison Service (TUCS), showed that CSPF's annual investment returns since 1995 were above the median about as many times as they were below. Similarly, comparing CSPF's returns to a peer group of similar multiemployer defined benefit plans using federally required annual reports found that CSPF's annual investment returns were in line with those of its peers. Specifically, CSPF's annual returns were above the median nine times and below it six times—and CSPF's overall (dollar-weighted) average annual return from 2000 through 2014 was close to that of the peer median average return of 4.8 percent. In addition, GAO found that CSPF's investment fees and other administrative expenses have also been in line with other large multiemployer plans. For example: CSPF's investment fees as a percentage of assets were about 9 percent lower than the median of large defined benefit multiemployer plans over the 2000 through 2014 period—though much of that difference is accounted for by a relative reduction in investment fees since 2007. CSPF's investment fees as a percentage of assets were, on average, about 34 basis points (or 0.34 percent). CSPF's administrative expenses related to the day-to-day operations of the plan have also been in line with other large multiemployer plans. CSPF's administrative expenses per participant were below the median for large defined benefit multiemployer plans for 12 of the 15 years over the 2000 through 2014 period. As of 2014, CSPF's administrative expense was $98 per participant, which is about 16 percent less than the median for large defined benefit multiemployer plans.

{"pred": " The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 established the Choice Program, which allowed veterans to receive care from community providers when VA facilities could not provide timely or accessible care. The program was funded with up to $10 billion and had a sunset date of June 6, 2019. Additional funding of $9.4 billion was provided through legislation in 2017 and 2018. The Choice Program was administered by two TPAs—Health Net and TriWest—each responsible for managing regional networks of community providers, scheduling appointments, and paying providers for services. Health Net’s contract ended in 2018, while TriWest continued until the program’s sunset. The report highlights challenges in the program, including delays in payment to community providers due to VA’s untimely payments to TPAs, strict reimbursement requirements, and inadequate provider education. VA officials noted that the program’s structure, including the use of TPAs for claims processing, informed the development of the Veterans Community Care Program, which aims to consolidate VA’s community care programs and improve payment timeliness. The report also discusses the impact of the VA MISSION Act of 2018, which requires VA to reimburse community providers within 30 days of receipt for clean claims and within 45 days for non-clean claims. The report found that VA and its TPAs had taken steps to improve payment timeliness, including implementing a new system for processing TPA invoices and updating processes for paying providers. However, the report also identified ongoing issues, such as delays in authorizing care and inadequate customer service for providers, which could affect the program’s effectiveness.

You asked GAO to review issues related to the timeliness of TPAs' payments to community providers under the Choice Program. This report examines, among other things, (1) the length of time TPAs have taken to pay community providers' claims and factors affecting timeliness of payments, and (2) actions taken by VA and the TPAs to reduce the length of time TPAs take to pay community providers for Choice Program claims. GAO reviewed TPA data on the length of time taken to pay community provider claims from November 2014 through June 2018, the most recent data available at the time of GAO's review. GAO also reviewed documentation, such as the contracts between VA and its TPAs, and interviewed VA and TPA officials. In addition, GAO interviewed a non-generalizable sample of 15 community providers, selected based on their large Choice Program claims volume, to learn about their experiences with payment timeliness. The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Choice Program (Choice Program) was created in 2014 to address problems with veterans' timely access to care at VA medical facilities. The Choice Program allows eligible veterans to obtain health care services from providers not directly employed by VA (community providers), who are then reimbursed for their services through one of the program's two third-party administrators (TPA). GAO's analysis of TPA data available for November 2014 through June 2018 shows that the length of time the TPAs took to pay community providers' clean claims each month varied widely—from 7 days to 68 days. VA and its TPAs identified several key factors affecting timeliness of payments to community providers under the Choice Program, including VA's untimely payments to TPAs, which in turn extended the length of time TPAs took to pay community providers' claims; and inadequate provider education on filing claims. VA has taken actions to address key factors that have contributed to the length of time TPAs have taken to pay community providers. For example, VA updated its payment system and related processes to pay TPAs more quickly. According to VA data, as of July 2018, VA was paying at least 90 percent of the TPAs' invoices within 7 days. In addition, VA and the TPAs have taken steps to improve provider education to help providers resolve claims processing issues. However, 9 of the 15 providers GAO interviewed said they continue to experience lengthy telephone hold times. According to VA and TPA officials, steps have been taken to improve the customer service offered to community providers. However, VA officials do not collect data on or monitor TPA compliance with customer service requirements—such as calls being answered within 30 seconds or less—for provider calls because they said they are not enforcing the requirements and are allowing TPAs to prioritize calls from veterans. Without collecting data and monitoring compliance, VA does not have information on challenges providers may face when contacting TPAs to resolve payment issues. GAO is making two recommendations, including that VA should collect data on and monitor compliance with its requirements pertaining to customer service for community providers.

{"pred": " The report provides an in-depth analysis of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), focusing on its capital funding, planning processes, and track preventive maintenance program. WMATA, established in 1967 through an interstate compact involving the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia, operates six rail lines and manages a 118-mile rail system. The agency's capital investments are funded through a combination of federal grants, state and local matching funds, and long-term debt. From fiscal years 2011 through 2017, WMATA received approximately $5.8 billion in capital funding, with the federal government contributing $3.2 billion and state and local jurisdictions providing $2.4 billion. WMATA also took on about $230 million in long-term debt during this period. The federal funding included grant awards and annual appropriations authorized under the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 (PRIIA). In 2008, PRIIA authorized $1.5 billion to WMATA, available in increments over 10 years beginning in fiscal year 2009, or until expended, for capital improvements and preventive maintenance. PRIIA funding and certain federal grants require state or local jurisdictions to provide matching funds. Additionally, a large portion of funding from state and local jurisdictions is governed by capital-funding agreements, which are periodically negotiated between WMATA and the states and localities. From fiscal years 2011 through 2017, state and local jurisdictions contributed on average about $340 million annually to WMATA, generally for capital purposes. The annual capital contributions from the jurisdictions are expected to more than double as a result of the recent legislation enacted by the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia in 2018. In addition, WMATA officials told us that it will have the ability to further leverage this dedicated funding and issue debt to finance its capital projects. WMATA has several steps in its capital planning process. These include developing the following: Capital Needs Inventory. WMATA periodically identifies its capital investment needs in this inventory. WMATA issued a Capital Needs Inventory in February 2010 and another in November 2016, each covering a 10-year period.

WMATA initiated a new preventive maintenance program for its rail track in 2017, and is currently implementing a new capital planning process. GAO was asked to examine issues related to WMATA's capital funding and maintenance practices. This report examines: (1) how WMATA spent its capital funds from fiscal years 2011 through 2017, (2) how WMATA's new capital planning process addresses weaknesses it identified in the prior process, and (3) WMATA's progress toward its track preventive maintenance program's goals and how the program aligns with leading program management practices. GAO analyzed WMATA's financial and program information, interviewed officials of WMATA, the Federal Transit Administration, and five transit agencies selected for similarities to WMATA. GAO compared WMATA's capital planning process and track maintenance program with leading practices. From fiscal years 2011 through 2017, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) spent almost $6 billion on a variety of capital assets, with the largest share spent on improving its rail and bus fleet (see figure). Over this period, WMATA's capital spending was, on average, about $845 million annually. WMATA's new capital planning process could address some weaknesses it identified in the prior process. WMATA established a framework for quantitatively prioritizing capital needs (investments to a group of related assets) over a 10-year period. However, WMATA has not established documented policies and procedures for implementing the new process, such as those for selecting specific projects for funding in its annual capital budget. WMATA is currently using its new capital planning process to make fiscal year 2020 investment decisions. WMATA has proposed a fiscal year 2020 capital budget of $1.4 billion. Without documented policies and procedures for implementing the new planning process, WMATA's stakeholders do not have reasonable assurance that WMATA is following a sound process for making investment decisions. WMATA has made significant progress toward its track preventive maintenance program's goals, which are to reduce both track-defect and electrical-fire incidents by 50 percent in fiscal year 2019 compared with 2017. In fiscal year 2018, WMATA met its goal for reducing track defect incidents and reduced electrical fire incidents by 20 percent. However, in designing the program, WMATA did not fully assess risks. For example, WMATA did not quantitatively assess the impact of track defects or electrical fires on its ability to provide service, nor did it consider other risks such as non-electrical track fires, which represent about 30 percent of all fires on the system, or other factors, such as resources or track time. Without a comprehensive risk assessment, WMATA lacks reasonable assurance that the program is designed to address risks affecting the safety of the rail system or other risks that could hinder the new program's success. GAO is making five recommendations, including that WMATA establish documented policies and procedures for the new capital planning process and conduct a comprehensive risk assessment for the track preventive maintenance program.

{"pred": " The World Trade Organization (WTO) is an international organization that administers trade rules and agreements negotiated by its 164 members to eliminate trade barriers and create nondiscriminatory rules to govern trade. Established in 1947 by the United States and 22 other nations, the WTO evolved from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which was a provisional agreement to reduce trade barriers and promote international trade. The WTO serves as a forum for resolving trade disputes and has been a central institution in the global trading system since its establishment. The United States has played a significant role in the WTO, particularly in the Uruguay Round of negotiations, which led to the creation of the WTO and the expansion of trade rules to include services and intellectual property rights. The WTO has been a key institution in the global trading system, with the majority of world trade taking place among WTO members. The WTO has faced challenges in recent years, including the inability to reach consensus on new trade rules and the growing use of protectionist trade policies by developed and developing countries. The WTO's effectiveness as a negotiating body for broad-based trade liberalization has come under intensified scrutiny, as has its role in resolving trade disputes. The WTO has often struggled to reach consensus over issues that can place developed against developing country members (such as agricultural subsidies, industrial goods tariffs, and intellectual property rights protection). It has also struggled to address newer trade barriers, such as digital trade restrictions and the role of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in international commerce, which have become more prominent in the years since the WTO was established. Global supply chains and advances in technology have transformed global commerce, but trade rules have failed to keep up with the pace of change; since 1995 WTO members have been unable to reach consensus for a new comprehensive multilateral agreement. As a result, many countries have turned to negotiating FTAs with one another outside the WTO to build on core WTO agreements and advance trade liberalization and new rules. Plurilateral negotiations, involving subsets of WTO members rather than all members, are also becoming a more popular forum for tackling newer issues on the global trade agenda. The most recent round of WTO negotiations, the Doha Round, began in November 2001, but concluded with no clear path forward, leaving multiple unresolved issues after the 10th Ministerial conference in 2015. Efforts to build on current WTO agreements outside of the Doha agenda continue. While WTO members have made some progress toward determining future", "answers": ["Historically, the United States' leadership of the global trading system has ensured the United States a seat at the table to shape the international trade agenda in ways that both advance and defend U.S. interests. The evolution of U.S. leadership and the global trade agenda remain of interest to Congress, which holds constitutional authority over foreign commerce and establishes trade negotiating objectives and principles through legislation. Congress has recognized the World Trade Organization (WTO) as the \"foundation of the global trading system\" within trade promotion authority (TPA) and plays a direct legislative and oversight role over WTO agreements. The statutory basis for U.S. WTO membership is the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (P.L. 103-465), and U.S. priorities and objectives for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)/WTO have been reflected in various TPA legislation since 1974. Congress also has oversight of the U.S. Trade Representative and other agencies that participate in WTO meetings and enforce WTO commitments. The WTO is a 164-member international organization that was created to oversee and administer multilateral trade rules, serve as a forum for trade liberalization negotiations, and resolve trade disputes. The United States was a major force behind the establishment of the WTO in 1995, and the rules and agreements resulting from multilateral trade negotiations. The WTO encompassed and succeeded the GATT, established in 1947 among the United States and 22 other countries. Through the GATT and WTO, the United States, with other countries, sought to establish a more open, rules-based trading system in the postwar era, with the goal of fostering international economic cooperation and raising economic prosperity worldwide. Today, 98% of global trade is among WTO members. The WTO is a consensus and member-driven organization. Its core principles include nondiscrimination (most favored nation treatment and national treatment), freer trade, fair competition, transparency, and encouraging development. These are enshrined in a series of WTO trade agreements covering goods, agriculture, services, intellectual property rights, and trade facilitation, among other issues. Some countries, including China, have been motivated to join the WTO not just to expand access to foreign markets but to spur domestic economic reforms, help transition to market economies, and promote the rule of law. The WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) provides an enforceable means for members to resolve disputes over WTO commitments and obligations. The WTO has processed more than 500 disputes, and the United States has been an active user of the dispute settlement system. Supporters of the multilateral trading system consider the dispute settlement mechanism an important success of the system. At the same time, some members, including the United States, contend it has procedural shortcomings and has exceeded its mandate in deciding cases. Many observers are concerned that the effectiveness of the WTO has diminished since the collapse of the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations, which began in 2001, and believe the WTO needs to adopt reforms to continue its role as the foundation of the global trading system. To date, WTO members have been unable to reach consensus for a new comprehensive multilateral agreement on trade liberalization and rules. While global supply chains and technology have transformed international trade and investment, global trade rules have not kept up with the pace of change. Many countries have turned to negotiating free trade agreements (FTAs) outside the WTO as well as plurilateral agreements involving subsets of WTO members rather than all members. At the latest WTO Ministerial conference in December 2017, no major deliverables were announced. Several members committed to make progress on ongoing talks, such as fisheries subsidies and e-commerce, while other areas remain stalled. While many were disappointed by the limited progress, in the U.S. view, the outcome signaled that \"the impasse at the WTO was broken,\" paving the way for groups of like-minded countries to pursue new work in other key areas. Certain WTO members have begun to explore aspects of reform and future negotiations. Potential reforms concern the administration of the organization, its procedures and practices, and attempts to address the inability of WTO members to conclude new agreements. Proposed DS reforms also attempt to improve the working of the dispute settlement system, particularly the Appellate Body—the seven-member body that reviews appeals by WTO members of a panel's findings in a dispute case. Some U.S. frustrations with the WTO are not new and many are shared by other trading partners, such as the European Union. At the same time, the Administration's overall approach has spurred new questions regarding the future of U.S. leadership and U.S. priorities for improving the multilateral trading system. Concerns have emphasized that the Administration's recent actions to unilaterally raise tariffs under U.S. trade laws and to possibly impede the functioning of the dispute settlement system might undermine the credibility of the WTO system. A growing question of some observers is whether the WTO would flounder for lack of U.S. leadership, or whether other WTO members like the EU and China taking on larger roles would continue to make it a meaningful actor in the global trade environment.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is about improper payments in federal programs, right? It talks about the steps agencies must take under IPIA, IPERA, and IPERIA, along with OMB guidance. The key steps are risk assessment, developing improper payment estimates, analyzing root causes, and reporting results. \n\nThe report also mentions that agencies have to use either statistically valid methods or alternative approaches approved by OMB. Some agencies, like the Department of Education and HHS, used alternative methods for certain programs. For example, DOD used their monthly reviews for Military Pay, and OPM used their QA process for Retirement. However, there are issues with these methods. \n\nThe report points out that DOD's Military Pay program doesn't address eligibility risks because they haven't fully assessed their processes. Similarly, OPM's Retirement program doesn't address underpayment risks in older claims. These limitations could affect the accuracy of their improper payment estimates and their usefulness for corrective actions. \n\nAnother issue is the treatment of nonresponse cases. Some agencies consider them improper, while others don't. OMB guidance doesn't specifically address this, leading to potential understatements in estimates and lack of comparability across programs. \n\nThe report also mentions that IRS subtracts recovered overpayments from their EITC improper payment estimate, which understates the estimate and limits the ability to address these issues before they occur. \n\nThe report concludes that while agencies have varying processes for estimating improper payments, some key risks like eligibility aren't being addressed. OMB guidance is lacking in areas such as testing procedures and handling nonresponse cases. \n\nThe recommendations include OMB developing guidance on risk-based testing and clarifying nonresponse treatment. Also, specific agencies (DOD, OPM, IRS) are advised to assess and update their processes. \n\nI need to condense all this into a one-page summary. Start with the purpose of the report, the key steps agencies must take, the methods used (statistical vs. alternative), the issues identified (like eligibility not being tested, nonresponse treatment), and the recommendations. Also mention the agencies involved and the implications of the findings. Keep it concise, maybe 3-4 paragraphs. Make sure to highlight the main points without getting too detailed.

Executive branch agencies are required to annually estimate improper payments for certain programs. Estimation of improper payments is key to understanding the extent of the problem and to developing effective corrective actions. Relevant laws and guidance provide agencies flexibility in developing estimates. This report describes agencies' processes to estimate improper payments in selected programs for fiscal year 2017 and the extent to which certain differences in these processes can affect the usefulness of the resulting estimates. GAO selected 10 programs across six agencies with the largest reported program outlays in fiscal years 2015 and 2016. For these programs, GAO reviewed relevant laws and guidance, analyzed agencies' policies and procedures, and interviewed officials at relevant agencies and OMB staff. The six agencies GAO reviewed reported taking various approaches related to key components of estimating improper payments—shown in the figure below—for 10 selected programs, which collectively reported outlays of over $2.5 trillion for fiscal year 2017. Sample selection. Eight of the 10 programs GAO reviewed reported using statistically valid approaches, and the remaining 2 reported using alternative methodologies approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The sampled data elements varied, including payments, medical claims, and tax returns. The age of the data used to develop fiscal year 2017 improper payment estimates also varied, ranging from calendar year 2013 to fiscal year 2017. Identification of improper payments. Some of the six agencies reported using processes designed specifically to estimate improper payments, whereas others reported leveraging existing reviews. These agencies' policies and procedures include a review of aspects of eligibility, except for those related to the Department of Defense's (DOD) Military Pay and the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Retirement overpayments. DOD and OPM have not fully assessed whether their estimation processes effectively consider key program risks. OMB guidance does not specifically address how agencies are to test to identify improper payments, such as using a risk-based approach to help ensure that key risks of improper payments are addressed. The six agencies also varied in the treatment of insufficient documentation, both in identifying and in reporting the root causes of improper payments. For the agencies that contact entities outside the agency to estimate improper payments, the treatment of nonresponse differed, with one agency including nonresponses as improper payments and another generally excluding the nonresponse cases from review. Although OMB guidance states that agencies should treat cases of insufficient documentation as improper payments, it does not specifically address the treatment of nonresponse cases. Calculation of the improper payment estimate. The six agencies generally reported using law and OMB guidance to calculate improper payment estimates for the selected programs, except for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) removed overpayments that were recovered when developing its estimate. OMB guidance requires agencies to include recovered amounts in their estimates. Removing these overpayments understates the EITC improper payment estimate and may limit IRS's ability to develop corrective actions to prevent improper payments. GAO recommends that OMB develop guidance on treatment of nonresponse cases and testing to identify improper payments, that DOD and OPM assess their estimation processes, and that IRS revise its methodology to not exclude recovered payments from its estimate. All of the agencies either agreed or partially agreed with the specific recommendations to them.

{"pred": " The report examines the Coast Guard's implementation of the Transition Assistance Program (TAP), focusing on data reliability, participation factors, and performance monitoring. Key findings include:\n\n1. **TAP Implementation Structure**: The Coast Guard's TAP program is managed by 13 installations, with one or two TAP managers per district. These managers oversee both their own installations and units across regions, such as Coast Guard District 9, which spans eight states and the Great Lakes. The program manager in Coast Guard Headquarters oversees TAP for the Coast Guard.\n\n2. **TAP Participation Factors**: The most common factor affecting TAP participation, cited at 11 of 12 installations, is servicemembers assigned to geographically remote locations. Other factors include rapid separation, insufficient awareness of TAP, and starting the transition process too late. Commanders sometimes prevent participation due to mission priorities, and unit commanders may require servicemembers to return to duties before completing TAP courses.\n\n3. **Data Reliability and Monitoring**: The Coast Guard lacks an up-to-date Commandant Instruction, leading to unreliable TAP participation data. Data are updated on an ad-hoc basis, often due to limited staff resources. The Coast Guard is in the process of adopting DOD’s TAP-IT Enterprise System, which is expected to improve data completeness and reliability by May 2018.\n\n4. **Performance Measures and Goals**: The Coast Guard does not have a formal performance goal for TAP participation, and lacks data on timeliness of participation and access to additional 2-day classes. Federal law mandates that DHS ensure all TAP-eligible servicemembers participate in the program, but without reliable data, the Coast Guard cannot effectively monitor TAP implementation or measure program performance.\n\n5. **Challenges in TAP Delivery**: The Coast Guard faces challenges in delivering TAP, including the need for commanders to balance mission priorities with TAP participation. Remote locations and emergency responses often disrupt TAP classes. Online TAP is used to accommodate rapidly separating servicemembers and those stationed in remote areas, but participants often struggle with the content.\n\n6. **Recommendations**: The report recommends that the Coast Guard issue an updated Commandant Instruction to improve data reliability, establish formal performance goals, monitor participation timeliness, ensure access to additional 2-day classes, and share TAP data with interagency partners. These actions would enhance the Coast Guard's ability to meet TAP requirements and support servicemembers in transitioning to civilian life.\n\nThe report highlights the importance", "answers": ["Thousands of Coast Guard servicemembers have left the military and transitioned into civilian life, and some of these new veterans may face significant challenges, such as finding and maintaining employment. To help them prepare, federal law mandated that DHS provide separating Coast Guard servicemembers with counseling, employment assistance, and information on veterans' benefits through TAP. GAO was asked to examine TAP implementation. This review analyzes (1) the reliability of TAP data on participation levels for Coast Guard servicemembers and the factors that affect participation, and (2) the Coast Guard's performance measures and monitoring efforts related to TAP. GAO interviewed Coast Guard headquarters staff; surveyed 12 Coast Guard installations that conduct TAP (100 percent response rate); collected and reviewed participation data for reliability; and interviewed TAP managers from three installations selected for size and location, and 25 Coast Guard servicemembers at one location. (For a companion report on TAP implementation for separating and retiring servicemembers in other military services, see GAO-18-23 .) The United States Coast Guard (Coast Guard), which is overseen by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), lacks complete or reliable data on participation in the Transition Assistance Program (TAP), designed to assist servicemembers returning to civilian life. According to senior Coast Guard officials, a major reason why data are not reliable is the lack of an up-to-date Commandant Instruction that specifies when to record TAP participation data. Consequently, the data are updated on an ad-hoc basis and may not be timely or complete, according to officials. Federal internal control standards call for management to use quality information to achieve the entity's objectives. Until the Coast Guard issues an up-to-date Commandant Instruction that establishes policies and procedures to improve the reliability and completeness of TAP data, it will lack quality information to gauge the extent to which it is meeting TAP participation requirements in the VOW to Hire Heroes Act of 2011. According to GAO's survey of Coast Guard installations, various factors affected participation, such as servicemembers serving at geographically remote locations or separating from the Coast Guard rapidly. TAP officials and Coast Guard servicemembers GAO interviewed said commanders and direct supervisors sometimes pulled servicemembers out of TAP class or postponed participation because of mission priorities. TAP managers also said they rely on delivering TAP online because many Coast Guard servicemembers are stationed remotely. The Coast Guard cannot effectively measure performance to ensure key TAP requirements are met because it lacks reliable data and does not monitor compliance with several TAP requirements. Further, the Coast Guard has not established a formal performance goal against which it can measure progress, although federal internal control standards stipulate that management should consider external requirements—such as the laws with which the entity is required to comply—to clearly define objectives in specific and measurable terms. Establishing a goal could help the Coast Guard define expected performance. In addition, the Coast Guard does not monitor TAP requirements regarding the timeliness of servicemembers' TAP participation or their access to additional 2-day classes. Consequently, it cannot know whether servicemembers are starting TAP early enough to complete the program or those who elected to attend additional 2-day classes were able to do so before separation or retirement, as required by the Act. Finally, the Coast Guard lacks an up-to-date Commandant Instruction that establishes the roles and responsibilities of Coast Guard staff in implementing TAP. Federal internal control standards stipulate that management should assign responsibility and delegate authority to key roles throughout the entity. Issuing an up-to-date Commandant Instruction that defines roles and responsibilities would clarify who is ultimately responsible for ensuring Coast Guard servicemembers attend TAP, thereby facilitating accountability. GAO is making seven recommendations, including that the Coast Guard issue a new Commandant Instruction establishing data collection policies, set TAP performance goals, monitor timeliness and access, and define roles and responsibilities.

{"pred": " (One page, 500 words)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is from a government agency, probably the GAO (Government Accountability Office), discussing radiation exposure, health effects, and federal regulations.\n\nFirst, the report talks about radiation doses and their effects. High doses can cause acute radiation syndrome with symptoms like nausea and death, while low doses are harder to detect. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (National Academies) in their 2006 report considered doses below 100 mSv as low dose, but there's not enough data to confirm the cancer risk at these levels. \n\nThe agencies like EPA, NRC, DOE, and FDA rely on scientific advisory bodies for radiation protection. These bodies recommend the linear no-threshold model, which assumes that even small radiation doses increase cancer risk proportionally. The National Academies' 2006 report supported this model, and they mentioned that new data since 1990 strengthened their confidence in the estimates. However, there are challenges in applying this model to very low doses because the data comes from populations like Japanese atomic bomb survivors, who had acute exposure, which might not be the same as chronic low-dose exposure in the U.S. \n\nDespite these challenges, agencies like NRC continue to use the linear no-threshold model because there's no evidence of a safe threshold. They set dose limits for the public and workers, which are much lower than the National Academies' low-dose threshold. For example, NRC's annual dose limit for the public is a hundredth of the low-dose level. They also apply the ALARA principle, keeping exposures as low as reasonably achievable. Some plants even set their own limits lower than the NRC's.\n\nThe FDA regulates medical equipment's radiation output but doesn't set limits on patient exposure. Instead, they encourage healthcare providers to reduce exposure where possible.\n\nThere's a lot of research funding for low-dose radiation effects, but the agencies didn't collaborate on overall priorities. DOE and NIH accounted for most of the funding, with DOE's Office of Science and Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security funding research. NIH also funded studies through various institutes. The funding decreased over the years, especially from DOE and NIH. \n\nThe report also mentions that while there are collaborative efforts on specific projects, there's no overarching mechanism for setting research", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's September 2017 report, entitled Low-Dose Radiation: Interagency Collaboration on Planning Research Could Improve Information on Health Effects ( GAO-17-546 ). The Department of Energy (DOE), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Food and Drug Administration generally used the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public in the radiation exposure settings that GAO reviewed. These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas. GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research . Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.

{"pred": " The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) of 1977 was enacted to ensure that federally insured banks meet the credit needs of the communities in which they operate. The law mandates that banks provide services such as mortgage, consumer, and business lending; community investments; and low-cost services that benefit low- and moderate-income (LMI) areas. The CRA requires federal banking regulators to conduct examinations to assess whether banks are meeting local credit needs, and to issue performance ratings based on the results of these examinations. The ratings are used to determine whether banks can engage in certain activities, such as mergers and acquisitions, and are a factor in the evaluation of bank performance. The CRA applies to banks with deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), such as national banks, savings associations, and state-chartered commercial and savings banks. The CRA does not apply to credit unions, insurance companies, securities companies, and other nonbank institutions because of the differences in their financial business models. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC administer the CRA, which is implemented via Regulation BB. The CRA requires federal banking regulatory agencies to evaluate the extent to which regulated institutions are effectively meeting the credit needs within their designated assessment areas, including LMI neighborhoods, in a manner consistent with the federal prudential regulations for safety and soundness. The CRA's impact on lending activity has been publicly debated. Some observers are concerned that the CRA may induce banks to forgo more profitable lending opportunities in nontargeted neighborhoods by encouraging a disproportionate amount of lending in LMI communities. Furthermore, some argue that the CRA compels banks to make loans to higher-risk borrowers that are more likely to have repayment problems, which may subsequently compromise the financial stability of the banking system. For example, some researchers have attributed the increase in risky lending prior to the 2007-2009 recession to banks attempting to comply with CRA objectives. Others are concerned that enforcement of CRA objectives has not been stringent enough to compel banks to increase financial services in LMI areas. Almost all banks receive Satisfactory or better performance ratings on their CRA examinations, which some may consider indicative of weak enforcement. This report informs the congressional debate concerning the CRA's effectiveness in incentivizing bank lending and investment activity to LMI customers. It begins with a description of bank CRA examinations, including how a bank delineates its assessment area; the activities that may qualify for points under the three tests (i.e", "answers": ["The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA; P.L. 95-128, 12 U.S.C. §§2901-2908) addresses how banking institutions meet the credit needs of the areas they serve, particularly in low- and moderate-income (LMI) neighborhoods. The federal banking regulatory agencies—the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)—currently implement the CRA. The regulators issue CRA credits, or points, where banks engage in qualifying activities—such as mortgage, consumer, and business lending; community investments; and low-cost services that would benefit LMI areas and entities—that occur with a designated assessment area. These credits are then used to issue each bank a performance rating. The CRA requires these ratings be taken into account when banks apply for charters, branches, mergers, and acquisitions among other things. The CRA, which was enacted in 1977, was subsequently revised in 1989 to require public disclosure of bank CRA ratings to establish a four-tiered system of descriptive performance levels (i.e., Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve, or Substantial Noncompliance). In 1995, the CRA examination was customized to account for differences in bank sizes and business models. In 2005, the bank size definitions were revised and indexed to the Consumer Price Index. The 2005 amendments also expanded opportunities for banks to earn CRA credit for public welfare investments (such as providing housing, services, or jobs that primarily benefit LMI individuals). Qualifying activities under the CRA have evolved to include consumer and business lending, community investments, and low-cost services that would benefit LMI areas and entities. Congressional interest in the CRA stems from various perceptions of its effectiveness. Some have argued that, by encouraging lending in LMI neighborhoods, the CRA may also encourage the issuance of higher-risk loans to borrowers likely to have repayment problems (under the presumption that low-income is correlated with lower creditworthiness), which can translate into losses for lenders. Others are concerned that the CRA is not generating sufficient incentives to increase credit availability to qualified LMI borrowers, which may impede economic recovery for some, particularly following the 2007-2009 recession. This report informs the congressional debate concerning the CRA's effectiveness in incentivizing bank lending and investment activity to LMI borrowers. After a discussion of the CRA's origins, it presents the CRA's examination process and bank activities that are eligible for consideration of CRA credits. Next, it discusses the difficulty of determining the CRA's influence on bank behavior. For example, the CRA does not specify the quality and quantity of CRA-qualifying activities, meaning that compliance with the CRA does not require adherence to lending quotas or benchmarks. In the absence of benchmarks, determining the extent to which CRA incentives have influenced LMI credit availability relative to other factors is not straightforward. Banks also face a variety of financial incentives—for example, capital requirements, the prevailing interest rate environment, changes in tax laws, and technological innovations—that influence how much (or how little) they lend to LMI borrowers. Because multiple financial profit incentives and CRA incentives tend to exist simultaneously, it is difficult to determine the extent to which CRA incentives have influenced LMI credit availability relative to other factors."], "all_classes": null, "length": 7111}
{"pred": " The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is a large federal agency with a complex structure, comprising over 1,000 facilities and offices, including the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), and National Cemetery Administration (NCA). The VA has a significant budget, with $186.4 billion requested for fiscal year 2018, including $82.1 billion in discretionary resources and $104.3 billion in mandatory funding. The report highlights the VA's efforts to address misconduct, including the establishment of various offices such as the Office of Human Resource Management (OHRM), Office of Accountability Review (OAR), Office of Inspector General (OIG), and the Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection (OAWP). These offices are responsible for investigating allegations of misconduct, ensuring accountability, and providing oversight to prevent and detect criminal activity, waste, abuse, and mismanagement in VA programs and operations. The report also discusses the VA's procedures for investigating whistle-blower allegations of misconduct, including the process for referring cases to the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) and the VA's internal investigations. The report identifies several issues with the VA's information systems, including the lack of standardization, incomplete data, and the absence of unique identifiers that could be used to track misconduct cases across the VA. The report also highlights the lack of adherence to VA policies regarding the documentation of evidence files, which could be used to verify that employees received reasonable and fair due process. The report also discusses the VA's procedures for investigating whistle-blower allegations of misconduct, including the process for referring cases to the OSC and the VA's internal investigations. The report concludes with 16 recommendations to the VA to improve its information systems, ensure adherence to policies, and enhance oversight to address misconduct and protect whistle-blowers. The report also highlights the importance of collecting reliable data on misconduct and disciplinary actions to enable VA management to make informed decisions regarding the extent of misconduct and how it was addressed department-wide. The report also discusses the potential for retaliation against whistle-blowers who disclose misconduct, and the need for VA to ensure that employees who report wrongdoing are treated fairly and protected from retaliation.

Misconduct by VA employees can have serious consequences for some veterans, including poor quality of care. GAO was asked to review employee misconduct across VA. This report reviews the extent to which VA (1) collects reliable information associated with employee misconduct and disciplinary actions, (2) adheres to documentation-retention procedures when adjudicating cases of employee misconduct, (3) ensures allegations of misconduct involving senior officials are reviewed according to VA investigative standards and these officials are held accountable, and (4) has procedures to investigate whistle-blower allegations of misconduct; and the extent to which (5) data and whistle-blower testimony indicate whether retaliation for disclosing misconduct occurs at VA. GAO analyzed 12 information systems across VA to assess the reliability of misconduct data, examined a stratified random sample of 544 misconduct cases from 2009 through 2015, analyzed data and reviewed cases pertaining to senior officials involved in misconduct, reviewed procedures pertaining to whistle-blower investigations, and examined a nongeneralizable sample of whistle-blower disclosures from 2010 to 2014. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) collects data related to employee misconduct and disciplinary actions, but fragmentation and data-reliability issues impede department-wide analysis of those data. VA maintains six information systems that include partial data related to employee misconduct. For example, VA's Personnel and Accounting Integrated Data system collects information on disciplinary actions that affect employee leave and pay, but the system does not collect information on other types of disciplinary actions. The system also does not collect information such as the offense or date of occurrence. GAO also identified six other information systems that various VA administrations and program offices use to collect specific information regarding their respective employees' misconduct and disciplinary actions. GAO's analysis of all 12 information systems found data-reliability issues—such as missing data, lack of identifiers, and lack of standardization among fields. Without collecting reliable misconduct and disciplinary action data on all cases department-wide, VA's reporting and decision making on misconduct are impaired. VA inconsistently adhered to its guidance for documentation retention when adjudicating misconduct allegations, based on GAO's review of a generalizable sample of 544 out of 23,622 misconduct case files associated with employee disciplinary actions affecting employee pay. GAO estimates that VA would not be able to account for approximately 1,800 case files. Further, GAO estimates that approximately 3,600 of the files did not contain required documentation that employees were adequately informed of their rights during adjudication procedures—such as their entitlement to be represented by an attorney. The absence of files and associated documentation suggests that individuals may not have always received fair and reasonable due process as allegations of misconduct were adjudicated. Nevertheless, VA's Office of Human Resource Management does not regularly assess the extent to which files and documentation are retained consistently with applicable requirements. VA did not consistently ensure that allegations of misconduct involving senior officials were reviewed according to investigative standards and these officials were held accountable. For example, based on a review of 23 cases of alleged misconduct by senior officials that the VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) referred to VA facility and program offices for additional investigation, GAO found VA frequently did not include sufficient documentation for its findings, or provide a timely response to the OIG. In addition, VA was unable to produce any documentation used to close 2 cases. Further, OIG policy does not require the OIG to verify the completeness of investigations, which would help ensure that facility and program offices had met the requirements for investigating allegations of misconduct. Regarding senior officials, VA did not always take necessary measures to ensure they were held accountable for substantiated misconduct. As the figure below shows, GAO found that the disciplinary action proposed was not taken for 5 of 17 senior officials with substantiated misconduct. As a result of June 2017 legislation, a new office within VA—the Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection—will be responsible for receiving and investigating allegations of misconduct involving senior officials. VA has procedures for investigating whistle-blower complaints, but the procedures allow the program office or facility where a whistle-blower has reported misconduct to conduct the investigation. According to the OIG, it has the option of investigating allegations of misconduct, or exercising a “right of first refusal” whereby it refers allegations of misconduct to the VA facility or program office where the allegation originated. VA does not have oversight measures to ensure that all referred allegations of misconduct are investigated by an entity outside the control of the facility or program office involved in the misconduct, to ensure independence. As a result, GAO found instances where managers investigated themselves for misconduct, presenting a conflict of interest. Data and whistle-blower testimony indicate that retaliation may have occurred at VA. As the table below shows, individuals who filed a disclosure of misconduct with the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) received disciplinary action at a much higher rate than the peer average for the rest of VA in fiscal years 2010–2014. Additionally, GAO's interviews with six VA whistle-blowers who claim to have been retaliated against provided anecdotal evidence that retaliation may be occurring. These whistle-blowers alleged that managers in their chain of command took several untraceable actions to retaliate against the whistle-blowers, such as being denied access to computer equipment necessary to complete assignments. GAO makes numerous recommendations to VA to help enhance its ability to address misconduct issues (several of the recommendations are detailed on the following page). GAO recommends, among other things, that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs develop and implement guidance to collect complete and reliable misconduct and disciplinary-action data department-wide; such guidance should include direction and procedures on addressing blank fields, lack of personnel identifiers, and standardization among fields; direct applicable facility and program offices to adhere to VA's policies regarding misconduct adjudication documentation; direct the Office of Human Resource Management to routinely assess the extent to which misconduct-related files and documents are retained consistently with applicable requirements; direct the Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection (OAWP) to review responses submitted by facility or program offices to ensure evidence produced in senior-official case referrals demonstrates that the required elements have been addressed; direct OAWP to issue written guidance on how OAWP will verify whether appropriate disciplinary action has been implemented; and develop procedures to ensure (1) whistle-blower investigations are reviewed by an official independent of and at least one level above the individual involved in the allegation, and (2) VA employees who report wrongdoing are treated fairly and protected against retaliation. GAO also recommends, among other things, that the VA OIG revise its policy and require verification of evidence produced in senior-official case referrals.

Additionally, Congress granted the FCC wide latitude and flexibility to revise its interpretation of the public interest standard to reflect changing circumstances and the agency has not defined it in more concrete terms. These circumstances, paired with changes in FCC leadership, have led to significant changes over time in how the FCC regulates the broadcast and telecommunications industries. The FCC is directed by five commissioners appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for five-year terms. The President designates one of the commissioners as chairperson. Three commissioners may be members of the same political party of the President and none can have a financial interest in any commission-related business. The current commissioners are Ajit Pai (Chair), Michael O'Rielly, Brendan Carr, Jessica Rosenworcel, and Geoffrey Starks. The day-to-day functions of the FCC are carried out by 7 bureaus and 10 offices. The current basic structure of the FCC was established in 2002 as part of the agency's effort to better reflect the industries it regulates. The seventh bureau, the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau, was established in 2006. The bureaus process applications for licenses and other filings, manage non-federal spectrum, analyze complaints, conduct investigations, develop and implement regulatory programs, and participate in hearings, among other things. The offices provide support services. Bureaus and offices often collaborate when addressing FCC issues. Beginning in the 110th Congress, the FCC has been funded through the House and Senate Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) appropriations bill as a single line item. Previously, it was funded through what is now the Commerce, Justice, Science appropriations bill, also as a single line item. Since 2009 the FCC's budget has been derived from regulatory fees collected by the agency rather than through a direct appropriation. The fees, often referred to as \"Section (9) fees,\" are collected from license holders and certain other entities. The FCC is authorized to review the regulatory fees each year and adjust them to reflect changes in its appropriation from year to year. Most years, appropriations language prohibits the use by the commission of any excess collections received in the current fiscal year or any prior years. For FY2020, the FCC has requested $335,660,000 in budget authority from regulatory fee offsetting collections. The FCC also requested $132,538,680 in budget authority for the spectrum auctions program."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3388}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about emergency powers in the U.S. government. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report discusses how the President can use emergency powers in times of crisis, which aren't limited to military situations. These powers come from the Constitution or statutes. Some are always available, while others are standby and only activate when a national emergency is declared. Congress can modify or end these authorities. \n\nThe report mentions that before World War I, Presidents used emergency powers on their own discretion, often through proclamations. After that, more standby emergency authorities became available, which could be activated by a proclamation. However, this practice was curtailed in 1976 with the National Emergencies Act. \n\nThe report also talks about historical figures like John Locke, who influenced the Founding Fathers. Locke argued that in emergencies, the executive could have broad discretion even if not in wartime. The Continental Congress had some emergency acts before the Constitution. \n\nThe report goes into detail about how emergency powers have been used in different historical contexts, like the Civil War under Lincoln, World War I under Wilson, and the Great Depression under Roosevelt. Each time, there were debates about the extent of presidential power and whether Congress or the courts would challenge it. \n\nThe National Emergencies Act of 1976 established procedures for declaring emergencies, including automatic termination after one year unless continued. It also required the President to specify the powers being used. The report also mentions that the number of active and inactive national emergencies has been tracked since the Act's passage. \n\nThere's a part about the 1976 report by the Senate Special Committee on National Emergencies, which identified 470 provisions of federal law delegating emergency powers. The report also discusses the need for reforms, like ending open-ended grants of authority to the executive. \n\nThe summary should cover the origins of emergency powers, their evolution through different administrations, the role of Congress and the Constitution, the National Emergencies Act, and the current state of emergency declarations. \n\nI need to make sure the summary is concise, covers all the main points, and is structured logically. Let me start by outlining the key sections: introduction of emergency powers, historical context, the role of Congress and the Constitution, the National Emergencies Act, and current applications. \n\nI should also mention the debate between different presidential theories, like the steward", "answers": ["The President of the United States has available certain powers that may be exercised in the event that the nation is threatened by crisis, exigency, or emergency circumstances (other than natural disasters, war, or near-war situations). Such powers may be stated explicitly or implied by the Constitution, assumed by the Chief Executive to be permissible constitutionally, or inferred from or specified by statute. Through legislation, Congress has made a great many delegations of authority in this regard over the past 230 years. There are, however, limits and restraints upon the President in his exercise of emergency powers. With the exception of the habeas corpus clause, the Constitution makes no allowance for the suspension of any of its provisions during a national emergency. Disputes over the constitutionality or legality of the exercise of emergency powers are judicially reviewable. Both the judiciary and Congress, as co-equal branches, can restrain the executive regarding emergency powers. So can public opinion. Since 1976, the President has been subject to certain procedural formalities in utilizing some statutorily delegated emergency authority. The National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. §§1601-1651) eliminated or modified some statutory grants of emergency authority, required the President to formally declare the existence of a national emergency and to specify what statutory authority activated by the declaration would be used, and provided Congress a means to countermand the President's declaration and the activated authority being sought.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this detailed report about USPS's competitive products. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points.\n\nThe report starts by highlighting the growth of USPS's competitive products from 750 million pieces in 2008 to 4.9 billion in 2017. Revenue from these products increased from 10% to 28% of total mail revenues. The USPS forecasts continued growth in e-commerce, which will increase the volume of competitive products, especially for last-mile delivery. They also mention that in 2017, revenue from competitive products exceeded expectations by $500 million due to e-commerce growth and successful marketing campaigns.\n\nThe report then discusses the challenges USPS faces with competition in first- and last-mile delivery services. To stay competitive, USPS uses scanning technology to provide real-time visibility for customers and to optimize its network, reducing costs. They divide the country into seven postal areas with 67 districts, each with its own management structure.\n\nThe report goes into detail about the scanning process for competitive products. USPS uses automation and various scanning technologies, including barcode scanners. Each item is scanned multiple times as it moves through the postal network. The data from these scans are transmitted to USPS systems, allowing managers, mailers, and customers to track packages. The report mentions that USPS has a goal of scanning 100% of mail pieces with barcodes, but some issues like missing or damaged barcodes can occur.\n\nThere are sections about the scanning procedures, including the use of different documents like the City Carrier Handbook, Rural Carrier Handbook, and other job aids. However, the report points out inconsistencies in these documents, which may lead to scanning errors. For example, some documents are outdated, and procedures are not uniformly applied across different post offices.\n\nThe report also discusses the USPS's internal control systems. It mentions that USPS does not follow the COSO Framework or the Federal Government's internal control standards, as they believe these are primarily for financial reporting. Instead, USPS has developed its own procedures based on management experience and business practices. However, the report suggests that without these standards, USPS might miss opportunities to improve its operations.\n\nThe report then outlines the recommendations made by the GAO. The Postmaster General should adopt internal control standards, improve communication of scanning procedures, and create standard operating procedures for managers to address scanning issues. USPS has agreed to these recommendations and is working on implementing them.\n\nI need to", "answers": ["USPS's competitive products have become increasingly important, comprising about 28 percent of USPS's total revenue. USPS scans these packages at various points throughout the postal network. When scans are inaccurate or missing, questions are raised about the veracity of USPS's data on scanning performance and can lead to customer complaints. GAO was asked to review USPS's scanning policies and procedures. In this report, GAO (1) describes USPS's scanning performance and (2) examines how USPS ensures accurate scanning. GAO reviewed USPS's policies and procedures and assessed them against internal control standards; interviewed officials from USPS and five high-volume mailers; and conducted site visits to six post offices in two USPS districts that represented a range of volume, number of routes, and performance. Mail products over which the United States Postal Service (USPS) does not exercise market dominance, such as many of its packages, are called competitive products. These items are scanned throughout the mail delivery system to track their progress (see figure). USPS data show that these products are almost always scanned. For example, USPS data showed that for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2018; all but one of USPS's 67 districts met their scanning goals. Additionally, mailers that account for a high volume of USPS's competitive products told GAO that they believed USPS was generally scanning products correctly. However, a small percentage of missed or inaccurate scans occur. For example, a report from one USPS district showed that for one week, 0.73 percent of the products delivered were missing a scan and that for the fiscal year to date almost 155,000 competitive products were missing a delivery scan. USPS has designed and implemented procedures and activities to help ensure accurate scanning, but some limitations could contribute to scanning errors. For example, USPS has not based its operational procedures for scanning on any internal control standards. USPS officials said the procedures were based on USPS's unique responsibilities, management experience, and sound business practices, but the officials could not identify specific standards or a framework that they followed as the basis for the procedures. USPS officials said they did not believe any internal controls standards applied to these procedures. By not basing procedures on standards, USPS may miss opportunities to improve how it achieves its mission to scan and measure the performance of competitive products. Additionally, USPS's scanning procedure documents, such as for outlining specific delivery scanning steps, are not always consistent, and USPS relies on more informal methods, such as meetings with employees to communicate changes. Thus, employees may not have accurate procedures available to them. Finally, USPS lacks procedures to help managers identify and address incorrect scans, address customer complaints or otherwise address scanning irregularities. For example, USPS's guidance for managers is limited to a list of bullet-points that do not detail the steps managers should follow to resolve scanning irregularities. In addition, this list has not been updated since 2005. Without consistent or detailed procedures, USPS's employees and managers may not scan items accurately or find information needed to resolve scanning issues—a situation that could hinder USPS's ability to reduce inaccurate or missing scans for these important mail products. GAO recommends that USPS: (1) identify and adopt internal control standards for its operational activities such as for scanning of competitive products; (2) improve the communication of procedures for scanning competitive products; and, (3) create procedures for supervisors on how to address inaccurate scans and resolve scanning issues. USPS agreed to explore addressing the first recommendation and agreed with the other two recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5486}

It mentions the life cycle of these projects, which has phases from formulation to implementation. There are key decision points, like project confirmation, where cost and schedule baselines are established. The report also discusses the Joint Cost and Schedule Confidence Level (JCL) initiative, which is important for projects with life-cycle costs over $250 million. NASA requires these projects to be baselined at a 70% confidence level, which includes cost and schedule reserves. \n\nThe report then goes into detail about three major space telescope projects: WFIRST, TESS, and JWST. Each has its own challenges and status. For example, JWST has had significant cost overruns and schedule delays, which were addressed by a congressional cost cap and a revised baseline. The report also mentions that NASA has taken steps to improve project management, such as enhancing cost and schedule estimating, providing adequate reserves, and improving oversight of contractors. However, there are still issues with some projects, like the human spaceflight programs, which have similar problems to JWST. \n\nThe summary should highlight the key points: NASA's mission, the life cycle of projects, the JCL initiative, the challenges faced by the three telescopes (WFIRST, TESS, JWST), the cost and schedule issues, the lessons learned, and the recommendations for improvement. \n\nI need to make sure the summary is concise, covers all the main points, and is structured logically.

Three space telescope projects are the key enablers for NASA to achieve its astrophysics' science goals, which include seeking to understand the universe. In its fiscal year 2018 budget request, NASA asked for about $697 million for these three projects, which represents over 50 percent of NASA's budget for its astrophysics' major projects. In total, these projects represent an expected investment of at least $12.4 billion. This statement reflects preliminary observations on (1) the current status and cost of NASA's major telescope projects and (2) lessons learned that can be applied to NASA's management of its telescope projects. This statement is based on ongoing work on JWST and ongoing work on the status of NASA's major projects. Both reports are planned to be published in Spring 2018. This statement is also based on past GAO reports on JWST and NASA's acquisitions of major projects, and NASA input. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) current portfolio of major space telescopes includes three projects that vary in cost, complexity, and phase of the acquisition life cycle. GAO's ongoing work indicates that these projects are each making progress in line with their phase of the acquisition cycle but also face some challenges. For example, the current launch date for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) project reflects a 57-60-month delay from the project's original schedule. GAO's preliminary observations indicate this project still has significant integration and testing to complete, with very little schedule reserve remaining to account for delays. Therefore, additional delays beyond the delay of up to 8 months recently announced are likely, and funding available under the $8 billion Congressional cost cap for formulation and development may be inadequate. There are a number of lessons learned from its acquisitions that NASA could consider to increase the likelihood of successful outcomes for its telescope projects, as well as for its larger portfolio of projects, such as its human spaceflight projects. For example, twice in the history of the JWST program, independent reviews found that the program was not holding adequate cost and schedule reserves. GAO has found that NASA has not applied this lesson learned to all of its large projects, and similar outcomes to JWST have started to emerge. For example, NASA did not incorporate this lesson with its human spaceflight programs. In July 2016 and April 2017, GAO found that these programs were holding inadequate levels of cost and schedule reserves to cover unexpected cost increases or delays. In April 2017, GAO recommended that NASA reassess the date of the programs' first test flight. NASA concurred and, in November 2017, announced a launch delay of up to 19 months.

A surety bond is a three-party instrument between a surety (who agrees to be responsible for the debt or obligation of another), a contractor, and a project owner. The agreement binds the contractor to comply with the contract's terms and conditions. If the contractor is unable to successfully perform the contract, the surety assumes the contractor's responsibilities and ensures that the project is completed. Surety bonds encourage project owners to contract with small businesses that may not have the credit history or prior experience of larger businesses and may be at greater risk of failing to comply with the contract's terms and conditions. Surety bonds are important to small businesses interested in competing for federal contracts because the federal government requires prime contractors—prior to the award of a federal contract exceeding $150,000 for the construction, alteration, or repair of any building or public work of the United States—to furnish a performance bond issued by a surety satisfactory to the contracting officer in an amount that the officer considers adequate to protect the government.

Advocates of raising the program's bond limit argued that doing so would increase contracting opportunities for small businesses and bring the limit more in line with limits of other small business programs, such as the 8(a) Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development Program and the Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Program.

While there are no specific statutory requirements for lobbyists to generate or maintain documentation supporting the information disclosed in the reports, the guidance recommends retaining copies of filings and documentation for at least 6 years. The LDA also requires lobbyists to report certain political contributions semiannually.

This is GAO's 11th report under the provision. GAO reviewed a stratified random sample of 98 quarterly disclosure LD-2 reports filed for the third and fourth quarters of calendar year 2016 and the first and second quarters of calendar year 2017. GAO also reviewed two random samples totaling 160 LD-203 reports from year-end 2016 and midyear 2017. This methodology allowed GAO to generalize to the population of 45,818 disclosure reports with $5,000 or more in lobbying activity, and 30,594 reports of federal political campaign contributions. GAO also met with officials from USAO to obtain status updates on its efforts to focus resources on lobbyists who fail to comply. GAO is not making any recommendations in this report. GAO provided a draft of this report to the Department of Justice for review and comment. The Department of Justice provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. For the 2017 reporting period, most lobbyists provided documentation for key elements of their disclosure reports to demonstrate compliance with the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, as amended (LDA). For lobbying disclosure (LD-2) reports and political contributions (LD-203) reports filed during the third and fourth quarter of 2016 and the first and second quarter of 2017, GAO estimates that 87 percent of lobbyists filed reports as required for the quarter in which they first registered; the figure below describes the filing process and enforcement; 99 percent of all lobbyists who filed (up from 83 percent in 2016) could provide documentation for income and expenses; and 93 percent filed year-end 2016 LD-203 reports as required. These findings are generally consistent with prior reports GAO issued for the 2010 through 2016 reporting periods. However, in recent years GAO's findings showed some variation in the estimated percentage of reports with supporting documentation. For example, an estimated increase in lobbyists who could document expenses is notable in 2017 and represents a statistically significant increase from 2016. As in GAO's other reports, some lobbyists were still unclear about the need to disclose certain previously held covered positions, such as paid congressional internships or certain executive agency positions. GAO estimates that 15 percent of all LD-2 reports may not have properly disclosed previously held covered positions. On the other hand, over the past several years of reporting on lobbying disclosure, GAO found that most lobbyists in the sample rated the terms associated with LD-2 reporting as “very easy” or “somewhat easy” to understand.

The SBA administers several key programs, including loan guaranty and venture capital initiatives to improve small businesses' access to capital, contracting programs to increase their opportunities in federal contracts, direct loan programs for businesses, homeowners, and renters to aid in recovery from natural disasters, and management and technical assistance training programs to support business formation and expansion. Congressional interest in these programs has increased in recent years, driven by the belief that small businesses are vital to economic growth and job creation. The report examines the SBA's appropriations over time, highlighting the variations in funding for its three major spending categories: disaster assistance, business loan credit subsidies, and \"other programs,\" which include salaries and expenses, business loan administration, the Office of Inspector General (OIG), the Office of Advocacy (Advocacy), and entrepreneurial development (ED) noncredit programs. The report notes that SBA appropriations have varied significantly since FY2000, with fluctuations in disaster assistance, business loan credit subsidies, and other programs. The variation in disaster assistance is largely due to supplemental appropriations for disaster relief following major hurricanes. Business loan credit subsidies are influenced by economic conditions, with revenue from fees and collateral liquidation typically sufficient during good economic times but insufficient during and immediately following recessions. This leads to the need for additional appropriations to cover the costs of defaulted loans, which are guaranteed by the \"full faith and credit of the United States.\" The report also discusses the impact of economic conditions on the SBA's other programs spending category, noting that appropriations for this category have generally increased at a pace exceeding inflation. The report provides data on the SBA's total available funds, which include carryovers, account transfers, rescissions, and sequestration, and compares these figures with actual and anticipated expenditures for the SBA's entrepreneurial development noncredit programs. The report highlights the significant variation in SBA appropriations since FY2000, ranging from a high of $2.359 billion in FY2018 to a low of $571.8 million in FY2007.

{"pred": " The report discusses the financial status and future challenges of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund (Trust Fund), which provides benefits to miners and their dependents affected by black lung disease. Key findings include:\n\n- **Benefits and Costs**: The Trust Fund offers cash assistance and medical benefits, with monthly cash payments ranging from $650 to $1,300 in 2017. Medical costs averaged $6,980 per miner annually. In 2017, about 25,700 beneficiaries received benefits, though the number has declined due to fewer coal miners and an aging population. However, there is a potential increase in beneficiaries due to rising cases of black lung disease, particularly in Appalachian coal miners.\n\n- **Claim Process**: Claims are processed by the Department of Labor (DOL), with contested claims adjudicated by DOL’s Office of Administrative Law Judges. Appeals can be made to federal courts, and interim benefits are provided during the appeals process.\n\n- **Funding Sources**: The Trust Fund is primarily funded by coal taxes, which are set at $1.10 per ton for underground-mined coal and $0.55 per ton for surface-mined coal, up to 4.4 percent of the sales price. Additional revenue comes from interest, fines, and penalties.\n\n- **Financial Challenges**: The Trust Fund has consistently faced financial shortfalls, with expenditures exceeding revenue. This has led to borrowing from the federal government, resulting in significant debt. Despite legislative actions to improve the Trust Fund's finances, such as the 1981 Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act and the 2008 Energy Independence and Security Act, the debt has continued to grow due to declining coal production and the scheduled 2019 tax rate decrease.\n\n- **Debt and Borrowing**: As of fiscal year 2017, the Trust Fund had an outstanding debt of about $4.3 billion. The 2008 legislation extended the current coal tax rates through 2018, but the scheduled tax rate decrease in 2019 is expected to reduce revenue significantly, potentially leading to a $15.4 billion deficit by 2050.\n\n- **Options for Improvement**: The report evaluates various options to improve the Trust Fund's financial position, including adjusting coal tax rates, forgiving interest or debt, and other measures. For example, increasing coal tax rates by 25 percent could eliminate Trust Fund debt by 2050", "answers": ["With revenue of about $450 million in fiscal year 2017, the Trust Fund paid about $184 million in benefits to more than 25,000 coal miners and eligible dependents. However, the Trust Fund also borrowed about $1.3 billion from the Treasury's general fund in fiscal year 2017 to cover its debt repayment expenditures. Adding to this financial challenge, the coal tax that supports the Trust Fund is scheduled to decrease by about 55 percent beginning in 2019. GAO was asked to review the financial positon of the Trust Fund and identify options to improve it. This report examines (1) factors that have challenged the financial position of the Trust Fund since its inception and (2) the extent to which Trust Fund debt may change through 2050, and selected options that could improve its future financial position. GAO reviewed Trust Fund financial data from fiscal years 1979 through 2017. GAO also interviewed officials from the Departments of Labor, Treasury, Health and Human Services (HHS) and representatives of coal industry and union groups. Using assumptions, such as the about 55 percent coal tax decrease and moderately declining coal production, GAO simulated the extent to which Trust Fund debt may change through 2050. GAO also simulated how selected options, such as forgiveness of debt, could improve finances. The options simulated are not intended to be exhaustive. Further, GAO is not endorsing any particular option or combination of options. GAO provided a draft of this report to DOL, Treasury, and HHS. The agencies provided technical comments, which were incorporated as appropriate. Multiple factors have challenged Black Lung Disability Trust Fund (Trust Fund) finances since it was established about 40 years ago. Its expenditures have consistently exceeded its revenues, interest payments have grown, and actions taken that were expected to improve Trust Fund finances did not completely address its debt. When necessary to make expenditures, the Trust Fund borrows with interest from the Department of the Treasury's (Treasury) general fund. Because Trust Fund expenditures have consistently exceeded revenue, it has borrowed almost every year since 1979, its first complete fiscal year, and as a result debt and interest payments increased. Legislative actions were taken over the years including (1) raising the rate of the coal tax that provides Trust Fund revenues and (2) forgiving debt. For example, the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 provided an appropriation toward Trust Fund debt forgiveness; about $6.5 billion was forgiven, according to Department of Labor (DOL) data (see figure). However, coal tax revenues were less than expected due, in part, to the 2008 recession and increased competition from other energy sources, according to DOL and Treasury officials. As a result, the Trust Fund continued to borrow from Treasury's general fund from fiscal years 2010 through 2017 to cover debt repayment expenditures. GAO's simulation suggests that Trust Fund borrowing will likely increase from fiscal years 2019 through 2050 due, in part, to the coal tax rate decrease of about 55 percent that will take effect in 2019 and declining coal production. The simulation estimates that Trust Fund borrowing may exceed $15 billion by 2050 (see figure). However, various options, such as adjusting the coal tax and forgiving interest or debt, could reduce future borrowing and improve the Trust Fund's financial position. For example, maintaining the current coal tax rates and forgiving debt of $2.4 billion could, under certain circumstances, balance the Trust Fund by 2050, whereby revenue would be sufficient to cover expenditures. However, a coal industry representative said that maintaining or increasing the coal tax would burden the coal industry, particularly at a time when coal production has been declining. Further, Treasury officials noted that the costs associated with forgiving Trust Fund interest or debt would be paid by taxpayers."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5783}
{"pred": " \n\nThe report examines how selected federal agencies assess whether personal property is needed and how they dispose of unneeded personal property, particularly in the context of space reduction efforts. It highlights the importance of managing personal property effectively to ensure that only necessary items are retained, while unneeded property is identified and disposed of in accordance with established procedures. The report outlines the process for managing and disposing of personal property, including the steps agencies take to determine if an item is no longer needed for their mission. It also discusses the challenges agencies face in identifying unneeded property, such as the lack of systematic processes and the reliance on triggering events like office moves or consolidations. The report emphasizes the need for agencies to proactively assess their property for continued need, as this can lead to more efficient operations and cost savings. It also highlights the role of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in providing guidance and support to agencies in managing their personal property. The report concludes that while agencies have policies and processes for managing personal property, there is a need for more systematic approaches to identifying unneeded property, which could help reduce waste and improve resource utilization. The report also notes that the General Services Administration (GSA) has established a government-wide personal property disposal process, which includes the steps for transferring, donating, selling, or abandoning unneeded property. The report recommends that OMB provide guidance to executive agencies on managing their personal property, emphasizing the requirement to continuously review and identify unneeded personal property. The findings suggest that agencies may be retaining property that is no longer needed, which could lead to inefficiencies and unnecessary storage costs. The report also highlights the importance of inventorying non-accountable property, which is often overlooked due to the high cost and manpower required. Overall, the report underscores the need for federal agencies to improve their personal property management practices to ensure efficient use of resources and to prevent waste and unauthorized use of property.\n\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is about how federal agencies manage their personal property, especially when they need to dispose of it. It mentions that agencies have policies for inventorying and tracking property, but there are gaps in identifying unneeded property. The report also talks about the process for disposing of property, including transferring, donating, selling, or abandoning it. There's a part about space reduction efforts, like the Freeze the Footprint and Reduce the Footprint initiatives, which led to agencies reducing their office and warehouse space.", "answers": ["The federal government owns billions of dollars of personal property—such as office furniture, scientific equipment, and industrial machinery. By law, each agency is required to follow GSA's disposal process so that an agency's unneeded property can be used by other agencies or certain non-federal entities. Since 2012, agencies have reduced their office and warehouse space due to government-wide initiatives, a reduction that in turn has required agencies to dispose of some affected personal property. GAO was asked to review how federal agencies identify and dispose of unneeded personal property. This report examines (1) how selected agencies assess whether personal property is needed and (2) how these agencies dispose of unneeded property and how, if at all, space reduction efforts have affected disposals. GAO reviewed federal statutes and regulations, and selected five agencies—EPA, Forest Service, GSA, HUD, and IRS—mainly based on space reduction results and goals. GAO reviewed these agencies' property disposal data for 2012 through 2016 and interviewed headquarters and field staff about their property management and disposal processes. The five agencies GAO reviewed—the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Forest Service, General Services Administration (GSA), Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and Internal Revenue Service (IRS)—generally do not have policies or processes for identifying unneeded personal property, such as office furniture, on a proactive basis. Instead, officials from these agencies said they typically identified unneeded property as a result of a “triggering event,” such as an office space reduction. Executive agencies are required by law to continuously review property under their control to identify unneeded personal property and then dispose of it promptly. Without such policies or processes, agencies may not be routinely identifying unneeded property that could be used elsewhere, and efforts to maximize federal personal property use and minimize unnecessary storage costs may not be effective. GSA has issued regulations establishing a government-wide disposal process for unneeded personal property. However, according to GSA officials, the agency lacks the authority to promulgate regulations or formal guidance on management of in-use agency property, and there is no government-wide guidance to agencies on identifying unneeded personal property. Agencies are required to have internal control activities—such as policies and procedures—for reasonable assurance of efficient operations and minimal resource waste, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides guidance to agencies on implementing such activities. Guidance from OMB that emphasizes agencies' internal control responsibilities could help ensure that agencies are proactively and regularly identifying property that is no longer needed. The selected agencies reported little difficulty in following GSA's personal property disposal process, reporting over 37,000 items as unneeded property in fiscal years 2012 through 2016. This property was disposed of through transfers to other agencies, donations to authorized recipients, sales, or discarding. When disposing of personal property from space reduction projects at locations GAO visited, agencies also reported using GSA's process (see figure). Overall, agencies said they have not experienced major challenges with disposing of personal property from space reduction efforts. This lack of challenges could be because projects are geographically dispersed and spread over several years.

These organizations play a critical role in promoting democracy, human rights, security, and development, and they are supported by the U.S. through various assistance agreements. The U.S. agencies, including State, USAID, HHS, and USDA, have established mechanisms to ensure that the strategic goals of these organizations align with U.S. interests. These mechanisms include annual performance reviews, project approval processes, and oversight by internal audit boards. The U.S. agencies also support the oversight mechanisms of these organizations, such as external auditors and internal audit boards, as required by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) standards. The report found that the strategic goals of the four inter-American organizations are predominantly aligned with the high-level strategic goals for the Western Hemisphere documented by the U.S. agencies. However, the report also identified gaps in the monitoring and documentation of these agreements. While USAID and HHS consistently included all key monitoring provisions in their agreements, USDA and State did not. Additionally, the agencies did not have full documentation of the required monitoring activities for the agreements reviewed. The report made three recommendations: one to USAID and two to USDA. The USAID Administrator should ensure that USAID officials have full documentation of required monitoring activities in agreements with inter-American organizations. The Secretary of Agriculture should ensure that USDA includes all key monitoring provisions specified by applicable guidance as part of agreements with inter-American organizations. The Secretary of Agriculture should ensure that USDA officials have full documentation of required monitoring activities in agreements with inter-American organizations. The report highlights the importance of effective monitoring and documentation in ensuring that U.S. funds are used appropriately and that strategic goals are met. The findings suggest that without these controls, the agencies may not have the necessary information to make informed budgetary and programmatic decisions.

These organizations help promote democracy, human rights,", "answers": ["The United States is a member of the OAS, PAHO, IICA, and PAIGH, which promote democracy, health care, agricultural development, and scientific exchange. GAO was asked to review U.S. assistance to these four organizations. In this report, GAO (1) assesses the extent to which the organizations' strategic goals align with those of U.S. agencies; (2) examines how the organizations oversee the use of their funds and the extent to which U.S. agencies have supported those efforts; (3) assesses the extent to which U.S. agencies included key monitoring provisions as part of assistance agreements; and (4) assesses the extent to which U.S. agencies had documentation of monitoring activities, including those called for by these provisions. GAO analyzed documents and interviewed officials from State, USAID, HHS, USDA, and the organizations. GAO also analyzed a nongeneralizable sample of 12 of the 60 assistance agreements that were awarded by State, USAID, HHS, and USDA to OAS, PAHO, and IICA and were active during calendar years 2014 through 2016. For each agency, GAO selected three agreements with the lowest, median, and highest dollar value. GAO found that strategic goals of the Organization of American States (OAS), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA), and the Pan-American Institute of Geography and History (PAIGH) are predominantly aligned with the strategic goals of the Department of State (State), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). For example, IICA's strategic goals of a productive agricultural sector, enhancing agricultural development, and food security are aligned with USDA's foreign assistance goals. State, USAID, HHS, and USDA fund activities in the form of assistance agreements (e.g., grants and cooperative agreements) with OAS, PAHO, and IICA, which in 2016 totaled $32 million. According to agency officials, the agencies employ mechanisms to ensure that these agreements align with U.S. strategic goals. OAS, PAHO, IICA, and PAIGH have established mechanisms for overseeing their use of funds, such as external auditors, internal audit boards, and anti-fraud and ethics policies. State and USDA have directly supported these mechanisms. For example, State engaged in the selection process for OAS's Inspector General. GAO's review of 12 selected assistance agreements found that USDA included no financial or performance monitoring provisions in one of its agreements and that State did not include two key monitoring provisions in one of its agreements, called for by applicable guidance. GAO found that the remaining 10 agreements it reviewed contained all key monitoring provisions and that State has since taken corrective action. GAO found that U.S. agencies did not have full documentation of 18 of the 42 monitoring activities required by the 12 assistance agreements GAO reviewed (see table). For example, USDA did not have full documentation, such as for financial reports, of any of its 10 required monitoring activities and USDA officials did not explain their lack of documentation. USAID officials explained that their lack of full documentation was due, in part, to grant officers not always following their document management policies. State and HHS have since taken corrective action. If an agency does not have full documentation of monitoring activities, it may lack information needed to make appropriate budgetary and programmatic decisions.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points. \n\nThe report discusses how the rise of e-commerce has changed the market for counterfeit goods. Previously, counterfeits were sold in secondary markets like flea markets, but now they're moving into primary markets such as e-commerce sites, corporate supply chains, and traditional retail stores. The shift is because counterfeiters are trying to deceive consumers into thinking the goods are authentic. \n\nIn the past, consumers could spot counterfeits by looking at price, appearance, or where they were sold. But now, counterfeiters use third-party marketplaces to look legitimate. They post pictures of real goods, fake reviews, and set prices close to genuine goods to trick consumers. \n\nThe report mentions that CBP and ICE have seen an increase in counterfeit goods seizures. From 2012 to 2016, IPR seizures went up by 38%. Most of these come from China and Hong Kong. The variety of products being counterfeited has also increased, not just luxury items. \n\nThe methods of importing counterfeit goods have changed too. Express carriers and international mail are now the main ways, making up about 90% of IPR seizures in recent years. \n\nThe report also did some testing by purchasing items from e-commerce sites. They found that 20 out of 47 items were counterfeit. The counterfeit items varied in how easy they were to spot, with some having obvious flaws like misspellings or incorrect certifications. Others were harder to identify, like discrepancies in packaging. \n\nThere are health and safety risks associated with counterfeit goods. For example, counterfeit phone chargers failed safety tests, and some cosmetics had dangerous chemicals. \n\nThe private sector is taking steps to combat counterfeits, like having IPR protection teams and removing counterfeit items. However, there are challenges, such as the increasing sophistication of counterfeits making it hard for law enforcement to distinguish them. Also, the variety of goods requires CBP to have more knowledge. \n\nThe report also mentions that counterfeiters are breaking shipments into smaller packages to avoid seizures. This complicates CBP's processing because the time and resources are the same regardless of shipment size. \n\nThere are challenges for the private sector too, like tracking goods from known counterfeiters through various fulfillment mechanisms. Also, the growth of e-commerce allows counterfeiters to quickly reinvent themselves if shut down.", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's January 2018 report, entitled Intellectual Property: Agencies Can Improve Efforts to Address Risks Posed by Changing Counterfeits Market , ( GAO-18-216 ). Changes in the market for counterfeit goods entering the United States pose new challenges for consumers, the private sector, and U.S. agencies that enforce intellectual property rights (IPR). Specifically, growth in e-commerce has contributed to a shift in the sale of counterfeit goods in the United States, with consumers increasingly purchasing goods online and counterfeiters producing a wider variety of goods that may be sold on websites alongside authentic products. For example, 20 of 47 items GAO purchased from third-party sellers on popular consumer websites were counterfeit, according to testing by the products' rights holders (see table), highlighting potential risks to consumers. The changes in the market for counterfeit goods can also pose challenges to the private sector—for example, the challenge of distinguishing counterfeit from authentic goods listed for sale online—and complicate the enforcement efforts of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). CBP and ICE engage in a number of activities to enhance IPR enforcement; however, while ICE has assessed some of its efforts, CBP has taken limited steps to do so. CBP's and ICE's IPR enforcement activities broadly include detecting imports of potentially IPR-infringing goods, conducting special operations at U.S. ports, engaging with international partners, and undertaking localized pilot programs or port-led initiatives. CBP and ICE have collected some performance data for each of the eight activities GAO reviewed, and ICE has taken some steps to understand the impact of its efforts. However, CBP has conducted limited evaluation of its efforts to enhance IPR enforcement. Consequently, CBP may lack information needed to ensure it is investing its resources in the most efficient and effective activities. CBP and ICE generally collaborate on IPR enforcement, but according to private sector representatives, restrictions on CBP's information sharing limit private sector enforcement efforts. GAO found that CBP and ICE have undertaken efforts that align with selected key practices for interagency collaboration, such as participating in developing a national IPR enforcement strategy and agreeing on roles and responsibilities. However, sharing additional information about seized items with rights-holding companies and e-commerce websites could improve enforcement, according to private sector representatives. CBP officials said they share information to the extent allowed under current regulations, but CBP has not completed an assessment of what, if any, additional information would be beneficial to share with private sector entities.

This allows states to receive their quarterly grants for the second and third quarters of FY2019. However, additional legislation is needed for the final quarter. \n\nTANF is funded by federal and state funds. In FY2018, the basic block grant was $16.5 billion for the 50 states, DC, Puerto Rico, etc. There's also a contingency fund. States must spend a minimum of 75% of their FY1994 TANF funds, which totals $10.3 billion annually. \n\nTANF was created in 1996 under PRWORA. The block grant amount was set at $16.6 billion in 1996 and remained the same until FY2016.

TANF was created in the 1996 welfare reform law (P.L. 104-193). This report responds to some frequently asked questions about TANF; it does not describe TANF rules (see, instead, CRS Report RL32748, The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Block Grant: A Primer on TANF Financing and Federal Requirements, by Gene Falk). TANF Funding and Expenditures. TANF provides fixed funding for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the territories, and American Indian tribes. The basic block grant totals $16.5 billion per year. States are also required in total to contribute, from their own funds, at least $10.3 billion annually under a maintenance-of-effort (MOE) requirement. Though TANF is best known for funding cash assistance payments for needy families with children, the block grant and MOE funds are used for a wide variety of benefits and activities. In FY2017, expenditures on basic assistance totaled $7.1 billion—23% of total federal TANF and MOE dollars. Basic assistance is often—but not exclusively—paid as cash. In addition to funding basic assistance, TANF also contributes funds for child care and services for children who have been, or are at risk of being, abused and neglected. Some states also count expenditures in prekindergarten programs toward the MOE requirement. The TANF Assistance Caseload. A total of 1.2 million families, composed of 3.1 million recipients, received TANF- or MOE-funded assistance in September 2018. The bulk of the \"recipients\" were children—2.3 million in that month. The assistance caseload is heterogeneous. The type of family once thought of as the \"typical\" assistance family—one with an unemployed adult recipient—accounted for 32% of all families on the rolls in FY2016. Additionally, 31% of cash assistance families had an employed adult, while 38% of all TANF families were \"child-only\" and had no adult recipient. Child-only families include those with disabled adults receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI), adults who are nonparents (e.g., grandparents, aunts, uncles) caring for children, and families consisting of citizen children and ineligible noncitizen parents. Cash Assistance Benefits. TANF cash benefit amounts are set by states. In July 2017, the maximum monthly benefit for a family of three ranged from $1,021 in New Hampshire to $170 in Mississippi. Only New Hampshire (at 60% of the federal poverty guidelines) had a maximum TANF cash assistance amount for this sized family in excess of 50% of poverty-level income. Work Requirements. TANF's main federal work requirement is actually a performance measure that applies to the states. States determine the work rules that apply to individual recipients. TANF law requires states to engage 50% of all families and 90% of two-parent families with work-eligible individuals in work activities, though these standards can be reduced by \"credits.\" Therefore, the effective standards states face are often less than the 50% or 90% targets, and vary by state. In FY2017, states achieved, on average, an all-family participation rate of 53.0% and a two-parent rate of 69.5%. In FY2017, two jurisdictions did not meet the all-family participation standard: Nevada and Guam. This is a reduction from FY2012, when 16 states did not meet that standard. In FY2017, nine jurisdictions did not meet the two-parent standard. States that do not meet work standards are at risk of being penalized by a reduction in their block grant."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3000}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this detailed report about Medicare payment rates for laboratory tests. Let me start by understanding the key points from the report.\n\nFirst, the report discusses changes in Medicare payment rates for laboratory tests, particularly after the implementation of the Physician Fee Schedule (PAMA) in 2018. Before 2018, payment rates were based on 1984-1985 rates adjusted for inflation, with 57 different geographic fee schedules. The national limitation amount was the maximum Medicare would pay for individual tests, and the payment rate was the lesser of the lab's claim, the local fee, or the national limitation. \n\nThen, there were panel tests, which are groups of tests. These were divided into two categories: those without billing codes and those with billing codes. Before 2018, Medicare paid bundled rates for panel tests, which were based on the number of component tests. For example, in 2017, a panel with two tests cost $7.15, and with three tests, $9.12. The maximum was $16.64 for all 23 component tests. \n\nIn 2018, PAMA replaced the 57 fee schedules with a single national fee schedule. The payment rates were based on private-payer rates from 2016, using the median private-payer rates weighted by test volume. This change affected both individual tests and panel tests. \n\nThe report also mentions the different types of laboratories, like independent, hospital-outreach, and physician-office labs, and their revenue from Medicare. It discusses how private-payer rates vary by lab type and other factors. \n\nCMS collected data from about 2,000 laboratories, but not all complied with the reporting requirements. The report highlights the challenges in setting accurate Medicare rates due to incomplete data. \n\nAdditionally, the report discusses the impact of unbundling payment rates for panel tests, which could lead to increased Medicare expenditures. The report also includes recommendations for CMS to address these issues.\n\nNow, I need to condense this into a one-page summary. I should start by outlining the main changes in Medicare payment rates post-2018, the structure of panel tests, the data collection process, the challenges faced by CMS, and the recommendations provided. I need to make sure the summary is concise, covers all key points, and is easy to understand. I should avoid", "answers": ["Medicare paid $7.1 billion for 433 million laboratory tests in 2017. These tests help health care providers prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases. PAMA included a provision for GAO to review CMS's implementation of new payment rates for these tests. This report addresses, among other objectives, (1) how CMS developed the new payment rates; (2) challenges CMS faced in setting accurate payment rates and what factors may have mitigated these challenges; and (3) the potential effect of the new payment rates on Medicare expenditures. GAO analyzed 2016 Medicare claims data (the most recent data available when GAO started its work and the year on which new payment rates were based) and private-payer data CMS collected. GAO also interviewed CMS and industry officials. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) revised the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS) for 2018, establishing new Medicare payment rates for laboratory services. Prior to 2018, these rates were based on historical laboratory fees and were typically higher than the rates paid by private payers. The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA) required CMS to develop a national fee schedule for laboratory tests based on private-payer data. To revise the rates, CMS collected data on private-payer rates from approximately 2,000 laboratories and calculated median payment rates, weighted by volume. GAO found that the median private-payer rates were lower than Medicare's maximum payment rates in 2017 for 88 percent of tests. CMS is gradually phasing in reductions to Medicare payment rates, limited annually at 10 percent over a 3-year period (2018 through 2020), as outlined in PAMA. CMS relied on laboratories to determine whether they met data reporting requirements, but agency officials told GAO that CMS did not receive data from all laboratories required to report. CMS did not estimate the amount of data it should have received from laboratories that were required to report but did not. CMS took steps to exclude inaccurate private-payer data and estimated how collecting certain types and amounts of additional private-payer data could affect Medicare expenditures. However, it is not known whether CMS's estimates reflect the actual risk of incomplete data resulting in inaccurate Medicare payment rates. GAO found that PAMA's phased in reductions to new Medicare payment rates likely mitigated this risk of inaccurate Medicare payment rates from 2018 through 2020. However, GAO found that collecting incomplete data could have a larger effect on the accuracy of Medicare payment rates in future years when PAMA allows for greater payment-rate reductions. CMS's implementation of the new payment rates could lead Medicare to pay billions of dollars more than is necessary and result in CLFS expenditures increasing from what Medicare paid prior to 2018 for two reasons. First, CMS used the maximum Medicare payment rates in 2017 as a baseline to start the phase in of payment-rate reductions instead of using actual Medicare payment rates. This resulted in excess payments for some laboratory tests and, in some cases, higher payment rates than those Medicare previously paid, on average. GAO estimated that Medicare expenditures from 2018 through 2020 may be $733 million more than if CMS had phased in payment-rate reductions based on the average payment rates in 2016. Second, CMS stopped paying a bundled payment rate for certain panel tests (groups of laboratory tests generally performed together), as was its practice prior to 2018, because CMS had not yet clarified its authority to do so under PAMA, according to officials. CMS is currently reviewing whether it has the authority to bundle payment rates for panel tests to reflect the efficiency of conducting a group of tests. GAO estimated that if the payment rate for each panel test were unbundled, Medicare expenditures could increase by as much as $10.3 billion from 2018 through 2020 compared to estimated Medicare expenditures using lower bundled payment rates for panel tests. GAO recommends that the Administrator of CMS (1) collect complete private-payer data from all laboratories required to report or address the estimated effects of incomplete data, (2) phase in payment-rate reductions that start from the actual payment rates rather than the maximum payment rates Medicare paid prior to 2018, and (3) use bundled rates for panel tests. HHS concurred with GAO's first recommendation, neither agreed nor disagreed with the other two, and has since issued guidance to help address the third. GAO believes CMS should fully address these recommendations to prevent Medicare from paying more than is necessary."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6322}

The report discusses the role of banks in the US economy, the three categories of bank regulations (safety and soundness, consumer protection, and anti-money laundering), and the division of regulatory authority between federal and state governments. It also covers the concept of federal preemption, which is based on the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, and how state laws can be overridden by federal laws in certain cases. The report then goes into the history of the American dual banking system, explaining how the federal and state governments have regulated banks over time. It discusses key Supreme Court decisions, such as Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson, which established that federal law preempts state laws that \"significantly interfere\" with the powers of national banks. The report also covers the OCC's preemption rules and the Dodd-Frank Act's provisions regarding the preemption of state consumer protection laws. Finally, the report outlines current issues in banking preemption, including the extent to which non-banks can benefit from federal preemption of state usury laws, the OCC's decision to grant special purpose national bank charters to financial technology (FinTech) companies, and proposals to provide legal protections to banks serving marijuana businesses that comply with state law.\n\nSo, the summary needs to be concise, covering the main points: the role of banks, the three categories of regulations, the concept of federal preemption, the history of the dual banking system, key Supreme Court decisions, OCC's rules, Dodd-Frank provisions, and current issues. I need to make sure the summary is one page, around 500 words, and flows logically. I should start with an introduction about banks and their role, then move into the three categories of regulations, explain federal preemption, discuss the dual banking system's history, key court cases, OCC's rules, Dodd-Frank, and current issues. I need to avoid too much detail but still capture the essence of the report. Also, check for any key terms or concepts that need to be included, like the Supremacy Clause, dual banking system, Barnett Bank decision, OCC's preemption rules, Dodd-Frank Act, and current issues like FinTech charters and marijuana businesses. Make sure the summary is structured and covers all these points without being too verbose. Also, check for any", "answers": ["Banks play a critical role in the United States economy, channeling money from savers to borrowers and facilitating productive investment. While the nature of lawmakers' interest in bank regulation has shifted over time, most bank regulations fall into one of three general categories. First, banks must abide by a variety of safety-and-soundness requirements designed to minimize the risk of their failure and maintain macroeconomic stability. Second, banks must comply with consumer protection rules intended to deter abusive practices and provide consumers with complete information about financial products and services. Third, banks are subject to various reporting, recordkeeping, and anti-money laundering requirements designed to assist law enforcement in investigating criminal activity. The substantive content of these requirements remains the subject of intense debate. However, the division of regulatory authority over banks between the federal government and the states plays a key role in shaping that content. In some cases, federal law displaces (or \"preempts\") state bank regulations. In other cases, states are permitted to supplement federal regulations with different, sometimes stricter requirements. Because of its substantive implications, federal preemption has recently become a flashpoint in debates surrounding bank regulation. In the American \"dual banking system,\" banks can apply for a national charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) or a state charter from a state's banking authority. A bank's choice of chartering authority is also a choice of primary regulator, as the OCC serves as the primary regulator of national banks and state regulatory agencies serve as the primary regulators of state-chartered banks. However, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) also play an important role in bank regulation. The Federal Reserve supervises all national banks and state-chartered banks that become members of the Federal Reserve System (FRS), while the FDIC supervises all state banks that do not become members of the FRS. This complex regulatory architecture has resulted in a \"symbiotic system\" with both federal regulation of state banks and state regulation of national banks. In the modern dual banking system, national banks are often subject to generally applicable state laws, and state banks are subject to both generally applicable federal laws and regulations imposed by their federal regulators. The evolution of this system during the 20th century caused the regulation of national banks and state banks to converge in a number of important ways. However, despite this convergence, federal preemption provides national banks with certain unique advantages. In Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson, the Supreme Court held that the National Bank Act (NBA) preempts state laws that \"significantly interfere\" with the powers of national banks. The Court has also issued two decisions on the preemptive scope of a provision of the NBA limiting states' \"visitorial powers\" over national banks. Finally, OCC rules have taken a broad view of the preemptive effects of the NBA, limiting the ways in which states can regulate national banks. Courts, regulators, and legislators have recently confronted a number of issues involving banking preemption and related federalism questions. Specifically, Congress has considered legislation that would overturn a line of judicial decisions concerning the circumstances in which non-banks can benefit from federal preemption of state usury laws. The OCC has also announced its intention to grant national bank charters to certain financial technology (FinTech) companies—a decision that is currently being litigated. Finally, Congress has recently turned its attention to the banking industry's response to state efforts to legalize and regulate marijuana."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8713}

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report is for Congress, discussing the TAO-205 program, which is building 20 fleet oilers for the Navy. The Navy is requesting funding for the fifth and sixth ships in FY2020. The report outlines several issues for Congress to consider: approving, rejecting, or modifying the funding request; determining the number of oilers needed in the future; and whether to encourage the Navy to add more self-defense equipment to the ships.\n\nFirst, I should outline the purpose of the report. It's providing background and issues for Congress regarding the TAO-205 program. The main points are the funding request, the number of oilers needed, and the self-defense equipment.\n\nThe report explains the role of fleet oilers in transferring fuel and other supplies to Navy ships, enabling sustained operations. They are part of the Combat Logistics Force (CLF), which includes other replenishment ships. The current fleet of oilers is the 15 Henry J. Kaiser (TAO-187) class, built between 1982-1989, with a service life of 35 years. The first of these will reach 35 years in 2021. These ships are being replaced by the TAO-205 class, which is designed to be more efficient and use existing technologies. The TAO-205s are built by GD/NASSCO in San Diego, and the first ship is scheduled for delivery in November 2020.\n\nThe Navy's FY2020 budget request includes funding for the fifth and sixth ships, with an estimated total procurement cost of $12.196 billion for all 20 ships. The report also mentions the Navy's plan to build the remaining nine ships at a rate of one per year starting in FY2025. The procurement cost for the fifth and sixth ships is $1,056.3 million, with $75 million in prior-year AP funding and $981.2 million requested in FY2020.\n\nCongress is considering whether to approve the funding request, which could affect Navy capabilities and the shipbuilding industry.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points. The report is about the three service classifications in the federal government: competitive service, excepted service, and Senior Executive Service (SES). \n\nFirst, the competitive service is the largest, with over two million workers. They are evaluated through competitive exams, which are practical and based on objective standards. The report mentions that the competitive service includes positions in the executive branch, except for those in the excepted service or SES. There are different types of appointments within the competitive service, like career-conditional, term, and temporary. The pay is based on the General Schedule (GS), which has 15 grades and 10 steps. Employees have certain rights regarding adverse actions, like notice and appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).\n\nThen there's the excepted service, which is about 1/3 of federal workers. These positions are not subject to competitive exams and are categorized into four schedules (A, B, C, D). Each schedule has different qualifications and purposes. For example, Schedule A includes positions like attorneys and short-term critical needs, while Schedule D includes STEM roles. Excepted service employees are paid under the General Schedule, and they have similar notice and appeal rights as the competitive service, though some have different durational requirements.\n\nThe SES is a separate cadre of high-level administrators. They are not subject to the same hiring and removal standards as the competitive or excepted services. SES positions are managerial or supervisory, above GS-15, and have a different pay structure. The report mentions that there are over 7,000 SES positions, with different types of appointments (career, noncareer, limited term, limited emergency). The pay is based on performance appraisals, with a minimum of 120% of GS-15 and a maximum of Level III of the Executive Schedule. However, their total pay is capped at Level I. There are also specific removal procedures for SES members, especially those in the VA, which were updated by the 2017 Act.\n\nI need to condense all this into a one-page summary. Start with the main points: the three service classifications, their definitions, key differences, and the structure of each. Mention the competitive service's size, the exams, appointment types, pay structure, and rights. Then the excepted service's categories and how", "answers": ["According to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the federal workforce consists of an estimated two million civilian employees. Federal law categorizes these employees into three types of service—the competitive service, the excepted service, and the Senior Executive Service (SES)—that may be distinguished by different selection, compensation, and other standards. Title 5 of the U.S. Code (Title 5) contains most of the standards governing federal employment, and OPM is generally responsible for implementing these requirements. The competitive service largely consists of all civil service positions in the executive branch, other than (1) positions excepted from the competitive service by statute; (2) positions appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate; and (3) the SES. Traditionally, OPM has administered examinations for entrance into the competitive service. These examinations are meant to be \"practical in character\" and relate to \"matters that fairly test the relative capacity and fitness of the applicants for the appointment sought.\" Title 5 also authorizes OPM to prescribe rules allowing agencies to hire candidates directly under specified circumstances. The excepted service includes designated civil service positions that are not in the competitive service or the SES and are not subject to competitive examination. OPM maintains authority to exempt a position from the competitive service when it determines that an appointment through competitive examination is not practicable, or the recruitment of students or recent graduates would be better achieved through alternate recruitment and assessment processes. The pay structure for the competitive service and the excepted service is similar. Both services are typically paid in accordance with the General Schedule, a schedule of annual basic pay rates that consists of 15 grades, designated \"GS-1\" through \"GS-15.\" This fixed pay scale is generally designed to reflect, among other things, equal pay for substantially equal work within a local pay area. Additionally, the competitive service and the excepted service generally have similar notice and appeal rights for adverse personnel actions. For example, before a removal, a suspension for more than 14 days, a reduction in grade or pay, or a furlough of 30 days or less, the agency must provide at least 30 days' advance written notice to the affected employee. The employee must also be given a reasonable time to respond to the notice and provide affidavits and other evidence to support the answer. Some adverse actions may also be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB or Board), an independent, quasi-judicial agency that reviews and adjudicates specified personnel actions taken against qualifying federal employees. The SES is a corps of some 7,000 high-level government administrators who manage major programs and projects within most federal agencies. In these leadership roles, SES members may serve as a link between top-level political appointees of an agency and career civil servants within the agency. The SES is governed by a regulatory structure separate from the competitive and excepted services. While SES members are primarily career appointees chosen through a merit-based competitive hiring process, others are noncareer, limited term or limited emergency appointees (commonly political appointees) selected by agency leadership. To shield certain SES roles from political influence, some SES positions (career reserved positions) must be filled with career appointees, and Title 5 limits the number of noncareer and limited term appointees that may serve in SES positions. The SES pay structure is distinct from the rest of the civil service. Title 5 specifies that SES members are paid within a particular range based on an executive's individual performance or contribution to agency performance (or both), as measured under a performance appraisal system. In addition, Title 5 articulates special conditions and procedures for removing, suspending, or taking other adverse actions against a member of the SES. For example, career SES appointees who have successfully completed a one-year probationary period may be removed or subject to adverse action only for specified reasons, including misconduct and substandard performance. Career appointees must receive advance written notice of these actions, and an opportunity to appeal the action. In comparison, noncareer, limited term, and limited emergency appointees are generally not subject to the same protections and may be removed from the SES at any time."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2697}

U.S. Navy Admiral Philip Davidson, in his responses to advance policy questions from the Senate Armed Services Committee for an April 17, 2018, hearing to consider his nomination to become Commander, U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM), stated that \"China is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in all scenarios short of war with the United States.\" Chinese control of the SCS—and, more generally, Chinese domination of China's near-seas region, meaning the SCS, the East China Sea (ECS), and the Yellow Sea—could substantially affect U.S. strategic, political, and economic interests in the Indo-Pacific region and elsewhere. China is a party to multiple territorial disputes in the SCS and ECS, including, in particular, disputes with multiple neighboring countries over the Paracel Islands, Spratly Islands, and Scarborough Shoal in the SCS, and with Japan over the Senkaku Islands in the ECS. Up through 2014, U.S. concern over these disputes centered more on their potential for causing tension, incidents, and a risk of conflict between China and its neighbors in the region, including U.S. allies Japan and the Philippines and emerging partner states such as Vietnam. While that concern remains, particularly regarding the potential for a conflict between China and Japan involving the Senkaku Islands, U.S. concern since 2014 (i.e., since China's island-building activities in the Spratly Islands were first publicly reported) has shifted increasingly to how China's strengthening position in the SCS may be affecting the risk of a U.S.-China crisis or conflict in the SCS and the broader U.S.-Chinese strategic competition. In addition to territorial disputes in the SCS and ECS, China is involved in a dispute, particularly with the United States, over whether China has a right under international law to regulate the activities of foreign military forces operating within China's exclusive economic zone (EEZ). The position of the United States and most other countries is that while international law gives coastal states the right to regulate economic activities (such as fishing and oil exploration) within their EEZs, it does not give coastal states the right to regulate foreign military activities in the parts of their EEZs beyond their 12-nautical-mile territorial waters. The position of China and some other countries (i.e., a minority group among the world's nations) is that UNCLOS gives coastal states the right to regulate not only economic activities, but also foreign military activities, in their EEZs. The dispute appears to be at the heart of multiple incidents between Chinese and U.S. ships and aircraft in international waters and airspace since 2001, and has potential implications not only for China's EEZs, but for U.S. naval operations in EEZs globally, and for international law of the sea. A key issue for Congress is how the United States should respond to China's actions in the SCS and ECS—particularly its island-building and base-construction activities in the Spratly Islands—and to China's strengthening position in the SCS. A key oversight question for Congress is whether the Trump Administration has an appropriate strategy—and an appropriate amount of resources for implementing that strategy—for countering China's \"salami-slicing\" strategy or gray zone operations for gradually strengthening its position in the SCS, for imposing costs on China for its actions in the SCS and ECS, and for defending and promoting U.S. interests in the region."], "all_classes": null, "length": 40508}
{"pred": " The Department of Defense (DOD) operates 63 laboratories, warfare centers, and engineering centers across the Army, Navy, and Air Force, employing approximately 50,000 scientists and engineers. These labs are managed within the military service chain of command and are funded through the DOD's research, development, test, and evaluation budget, which is divided into seven categories for annual budget estimates. Funding models vary by service: the Air Force and Army rely on mission funding or customer funding, while the Navy uses the Navy Working Capital Fund, a revolving fund that finances Department of the Navy activities on a reimbursable basis. The Navy also employs a Capital Investment Program to obtain capital assets, including minor military construction projects for labs. The report highlights the use of four key legislative authorities by DOD labs to foster innovation and efficiency: 1) Laboratory Initiated Research Authority, which allows labs to fund projects in four categories (basic and applied research, technology transition, workforce development, and lab infrastructure revitalization). 2) Direct Hire Authorities, which provide a streamlined hiring process to allow labs to compete with private industry and academia for high-quality scientific, engineering, and technical talent. 3) Laboratory Enhancement Pilot Program, which allows labs to propose alternative and innovative methods for managing and operating labs, with the ability to waive regulations unless prohibited by existing law. 3) Micro-purchase Authority, which facilitates the purchasing process for labs by allowing them to use simplified acquisition methods for small purchases, with an increased threshold to $10,000 for DOD science and technology labs. The report also discusses the governance models of DOD-sponsored federally funded research centers (FFRDCs) and university-affiliated research centers (UARCs), as well as non-defense labs like the Department of Energy (Energy) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The report found that while most DOD labs have used the Laboratory Initiated Research Authority, they have not used the full 4 percent of available funds or charged customers the full fixed percentage fee of costs as allowed by law. The report also discusses the challenges faced by DOD labs in using the direct hire authority, the laboratory enhancement pilot program, and the micro-purchase authority. The report concludes with three recommendations to DOD: 1) The Secretary of the Air Force should assess the potential costs and benefits of implementing accounting system improvements that would allow the Air Force Research Laboratory to charge customers a fixed percentage fee on provided science and technology activities, as allowed", "answers": ["Congress created several authorities that provide DOD research labs with ways to increase efficiency and foster innovation. Senate report 114-255 contained a provision for GAO to study governance models used by federal labs. This report evaluates DOD labs' use of authorities to foster innovation and efficiency. GAO selected four authorities that recent work on best practices for science and technology management and expedited defense lab hiring have shown to be the most crucial for supporting innovation; administered a survey to 44 lab directors to gain insight into their use of the authorities; interviewed key lab officials and contractors; and reviewed relevant policies and guidance. Congress has provided the Department of Defense's (DOD) research labs with several authorities to enhance management and operations. Four authorities that GAO examined provide lab directors with greater ability to make their own decisions regarding the funding of projects, hiring, lab management, and purchasing of equipment or services. 1. Laboratory initiated research authority. This authority, as implemented, provides labs with a means to fund new science and technology projects that they consider a priority. Labs may use a percentage of all funds available to the lab and are permitted to charge customers of the lab a percentage fee of the costs for activities performed by the lab for the customer. 2. Direct hire authority. This authority enables labs to compete with private industry for high-quality talent. For example, it provides for streamlined hiring of applicants with relevant advanced degrees, or students enrolled in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics programs. 3. Laboratory enhancement pilot program authority. This authority generally allows lab directors to propose alternative methods that might lead to more effective lab management, and waive certain policies or procedures that might affect implementation of these methods. 4. Micro-purchase authority. This authority raises the threshold for small purchases for DOD research lab activities from $3,500 to $10,000 to facilitate acquisitions. While labs have used these authorities, their use has sometimes been limited, particularly with the laboratory initiated research authority. DOD lab directors at Air Force, Navy, and Army cited several obstacles that impede wider use of that authority, specifically: Air Force: Financial management officials at the Air Force stated that the service's accounting system does not currently have an automated capability to transfer the allowable percentage fee of costs to a central account at the Air Force Research Laboratory. This lack of capability, officials noted, creates a significant administrative burden related to charging these fees. Navy: In fiscal year 2017, Navy labs invested $7.3 million in lab infrastructure projects, compared to $32.9 million and $53.7 million at the Air Force and Army, respectively. Navy lab officials told us that they were restricted in their use of infrastructure funds available under the laboratory initiated research authority due to a lack of clear guidance as to whether and how to use this authority within the Capital Investment Program of the Navy Working Capital Fund. Army: The Army requires its labs to use a similar percentage of funds from two sources: (1) what it refers to as directly appropriated funds and (2) funds labs charge for customer activities. Some Army lab directors reported assessing a lower rate on customer funds than allowed so as not to drive customers away. The labs then generally charge a lower than desired rate on their directly appropriated funds, which further constrains the total funding available to them. GAO is making three recommendations to enhance DOD's use of laboratory initiated research authority, including that the Air Force assess potential accounting system improvements, the Navy clarify how labs can use the authority for infrastructure improvements, and the Army assess its policy to determine whether changes are needed to remove disincentives for labs to use the authority.

The report is about the various programs and assistance provided by federal agencies, states, and local governments after major disasters. It includes natural disasters and terrorist attacks. The main types of aid mentioned are operational, logistical, technical support, financial assistance through grants, loans, and loan guarantees, and the provision of federally owned equipment and facilities.\n\nThe report starts by explaining that many programs are available after a President issues a major disaster declaration under the Stafford Act. There's also limited aid under an emergency declaration or on an as-needed basis. The report focuses on financial assistance programs that are frequently used in disaster response and recovery. It mentions that most of these programs are listed on the GSA website, beta.SAM.gov, and that the report doesn't include operational or technical assistance. Also, the report notes that unique factors in each disaster might lead to unique forms of assistance, and Congress has authorized specific forms of assistance on a limited basis after certain disasters.\n\nThe report then lists several key programs. The Individuals and Households Program (IHP) is the primary vehicle for FEMA assistance to individuals and households after a major disaster declaration. It provides financial and direct assistance for necessary expenses and serious needs that can't be met through other means. The assistance includes temporary housing, housing repairs, replacement, and permanent housing construction. There's also ONA (Other Needs Assistance) which covers funeral, medical, dental, childcare, personal property, transportation, and other expenses. FEMA covers 100% of housing assistance costs, but ONA has a 75% federal and 25% state cost share. There are caps on the amount of financial assistance an individual or household can receive, which are adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index. The maximum is $34,900 for FY2019, and the assistance is generally limited to 18 months from the date of the declaration, though it can be extended.\n\nOther programs mentioned include Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA), which provides benefits to individuals who lose their jobs due to a major disaster and are not eligible for regular unemployment. The Dislocated Worker Program offers training and assistance to those who lose their jobs and are unlikely to return to their current jobs. The SBA Disaster Loan Program provides loans to individuals, households, and businesses for uninsured or underinsured losses.

The programs summarized in this report fall into two broad categories. First, there are programs specifically authorized for use during situations occurring because of a disaster. Most of these programs are administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Second are general assistance programs that in some instances may be used either in disaster situations or to meet other needs unrelated to a disaster.

{"pred": " The report discusses the processes and challenges faced by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in overseeing state expenditures for Medicaid programs. Key points include the requirement for states to report expenditures quarterly on the CMS-64 form, with a 2-year filing limit for adjustments. CMS reviews these reports to ensure they are allowable and consistent with Medicaid requirements, using both quarterly reviews and focused financial management reviews (FMRs). However, the report identifies several weaknesses in CMS's oversight activities, including the lack of a comprehensive national risk assessment, inconsistent variance analyses for higher matched expenditures, and a sampling methodology that does not account for varying program risks across states. These issues may lead to errors in reported expenditures going undetected, resulting in CMS providing federal funds at higher matching rates than is allowable. The report also highlights the financial impact of CMS's expenditure reviews, which have saved over $5 billion in federal funds from fiscal years 2014 to 2017. Despite these savings, the report notes that CMS has faced resource constraints, leading to a reduction in staff dedicated to financial oversight activities by approximately 19 percent over the same period. This reduction in resources has limited CMS's ability to effectively target high-risk expenditures, potentially allowing for significant financial losses. The report concludes with three recommendations for CMS to improve its oversight activities: 1) Conduct a comprehensive national risk assessment to determine the adequacy and allocation of resources for overseeing state expenditures. 2) Clarify internal guidance on when a variance analysis for higher matched expenditures is required. 3) Revise the sampling methodology for reviewing expenditures for the Medicaid expansion population to better target high-risk areas. The report was reviewed and concurred with by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which noted that CMS will complete the risk assessment and take steps to ensure resources are allocated based on risk, program size, and historical financial issues. HHS also noted that CMS will issue internal guidance on variance analyses and is considering revisions to the sampling methodology for Medicaid expansion expenditures. The report emphasizes the importance of these oversight activities in ensuring that federal funds are used appropriately and highlights the need for CMS to address the identified weaknesses to improve the effectiveness of its oversight efforts.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. \n\nThe report is about CMS's oversight of state expenditures for Medicaid programs. It mentions that states report expenditures quarterly on the CMS-64 form, with a 2-year", "answers": ["Medicaid has grown by over 50 percent over the last decade, with about $370 billion in federal spending in fiscal year 2017. CMS is responsible for assuring that expenditures—reported quarterly by states—are consistent with Medicaid requirements and matched with the correct amount of federal funds. CMS's review of reported expenditures has become increasingly complex due to variation in states' Medicaid programs and an increasing number of different matching rates. GAO was asked to examine CMS's oversight of state-reported Medicaid expenditures. In this report, GAO examined how CMS assures that (1) expenditures are supported and consistent with requirements; and (2) the correct federal matching rates were applied to expenditures subject to a higher match. GAO also examined the financial impact of resolved errors. GAO reviewed documentation for the most recently completed quarterly reviews by 3 of CMS's 10 regional offices for six states that varied by Medicaid program expenditures and design. GAO also reviewed policies, procedures, and data on resolved errors; and interviewed CMS and state officials. GAO assessed CMS's oversight processes against federal standards for internal control. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which oversees Medicaid, has various review processes in place to assure that expenditures reported by states are supported and consistent with Medicaid requirements. The agency also has processes to review that the correct federal matching rates were applied to expenditures receiving a higher than standard federal matching rate, which can include certain types of services and populations. These processes collectively have had a considerable federal financial benefit, with CMS resolving errors that reduced federal spending by over $5.1 billion in fiscal years 2014 through 2017. However, GAO identified weaknesses in how CMS targets its resources to address risks when reviewing whether expenditures are supported and consistent with requirements. CMS devotes similar levels of staff resources to review expenditures despite differing levels of risk across states. For example, the number of staff reviewing California's expenditures—which represent 15 percent of federal Medicaid spending—is similar to the number reviewing Arkansas' expenditures, which represents 1 percent of federal Medicaid spending. CMS cancelled in-depth financial management reviews in 17 out of 51 instances over the last 5 years. These reviews target expenditures considered by CMS to be at risk of not meeting program requirements. CMS told GAO that resource constraints contributed to both weaknesses. However, the agency has not completed a comprehensive assessment of risk to (1) determine whether oversight resources are adequate and (2) focus on the most significant areas of risk. Absent such an assessment, CMS is missing an opportunity to identify errors in reported expenditures that could result in substantial savings to the Medicaid program. GAO also found limitations in CMS's processes for reviewing expenditures that receive a higher federal matching rate. Internal guidance for examining variances in these expenditures was unclear, and not all reviewers in the three CMS regional offices GAO reviewed were investigating significant variances in quarter-to-quarter expenditures. Review procedures for expenditures for individuals newly eligible for Medicaid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act were not tailored to different risk levels among states. For example, in its reviews of a sample of claims for this population, CMS reviewed claims for the same number of enrollees—30—in California as for Arkansas, even though California had 10 times the number of newly eligible enrollees as Arkansas. Without clear internal guidance and better targeting of risks in its review procedures for expenditures receiving higher matching rates, CMS may overpay states. GAO is making three recommendations, including that CMS improve its risk-based targeting of oversight efforts and resources, and clarify related internal guidance. The Department of Health and Human Services concurred with these recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5872}

Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points.\n\nThe report begins by outlining Egypt's military rule since 1952, mentioning four presidents: Nasser, Sadat, Mubarak, and Sisi. It notes that the military has consistently backed these leaders, with the Muslim Brotherhood as the main opposition. The only significant deviation from this pattern was during the Arab Spring in 2011, which led to the ousting of Mubarak and the brief presidency of Muhammad Morsi from the Muslim Brotherhood. However, Morsi's rule led to political turmoil, and the military, led by Sisi, intervened to restore order, leading to the Muslim Brotherhood's crackdown and the subsequent rise of Sisi's power.\n\nThe report then discusses Egypt's economic situation, including the impact of the IMF program, the 2013 military intervention, and the subsequent economic reforms. It mentions the country's growing economy, but also the challenges like high inflation and debt. The government has implemented austerity measures, and there's a focus on reducing debt through IMF-mandated reforms.\n\nThere's also a section on Egypt's foreign policy, including its role in the region, relations with the U.S., and other countries like the Arab Gulf states, Israel, Russia, and France. The report highlights Sisi's consolidation of power, including changes to the constitution to extend his presidency, and the military's role in suppressing dissent.\n\nHuman rights issues are a significant part of the report, including the crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood, the detention of American citizens, and the treatment of Coptic Christians. The U.S. has criticized Egypt's human rights record, leading to some tensions in bilateral relations.\n\nThe report also covers Egypt's role in regional issues, such as the conflict in Libya, the situation with the Nile River, and relations with the Muslim Brotherhood. It mentions the economic growth, the challenges with inflation and debt, and the ongoing political tensions.\n\nNow, I need to condense all this into a one-page summary. Let me structure it with an introduction, key points about the military rule, the Arab Spring and Morsi's presidency, the military's crackdown, Sisi's consolidation of power, economic reforms and challenges, human rights issues, and international relations.\n\nI should make sure to mention the", "answers": ["Historically, Egypt has been an important country for U.S. national security interests based on its geography, demography, and diplomatic posture. Egypt controls the Suez Canal, which is one of the world's most well-known maritime chokepoints, linking the Mediterranean and Red Seas. Egypt, with its population of more than 100 million people, is by far the most populous Arabic-speaking country. Although it may not play the same type of leading political or military role in the Arab world as it has in the past, Egypt may retain some \"soft power\" by virtue of its history, media, and culture. Cairo plays host both to the 22-member Arab League and Al Azhar University, which claims to be the oldest continuously operating university in the world and has symbolic importance as a leading source of Islamic scholarship. Additionally, Egypt's 1979 peace treaty with Israel remains one of the most significant diplomatic achievements for the promotion of Arab-Israeli peace. While people-to-people relations remain cold, the Israeli and Egyptian governments have increased their cooperation against Islamist militants and instability in the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip. Personnel moves and possible amendments to the Egyptian constitution highlight apparent efforts by President Sisi to consolidate power with the help of political allies, including colleagues from Egypt's security establishment. President Sisi has come under repeated international criticism for an ongoing government crackdown against various forms of political dissent and freedom of expression. The Egyptian government has defended its human rights record, asserting that the country is under pressure from terrorist groups seeking to destabilize Arab nation-states. The Trump Administration has tried to normalize ties with the Sisi government that were generally perceived as strained under President Obama. In January 2019, U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo delivered a major policy speech at the American University in Cairo, where he stated, \"And as we seek an even stronger partnership with Egypt, we encourage President Sisi to unleash the creative energy of Egypt's people, unfetter the economy, and promote a free and open exchange of ideas.\" The United States has provided significant military and economic assistance to Egypt since the late 1970s. Successive U.S. Administrations have justified aid to Egypt as an investment in regional stability, built primarily on long-running cooperation with the Egyptian military and on sustaining the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. All U.S. foreign aid to Egypt (or any recipient) is appropriated and authorized by Congress. Since 1946, the United States has provided Egypt with over $83 billion in bilateral foreign aid (calculated in historical dollars—not adjusted for inflation). Annual appropriations legislation includes several conditions governing the release of these funds. All U.S. military aid to Egypt finances the procurement of weapons systems and services from U.S. defense contractors. For FY2019, Congress has appropriated $1.4 billion in total bilateral assistance for Egypt, the same amount it provided in FY2018. For FY2020, the President is requesting a total of $1.382 billion in bilateral assistance for Egypt. Nearly all of the U.S. funds for Egypt come from the FMF account (military aid). In November 2018, the U.S. Defense Department notified Congress of a major $1 billion sale of defense equipment to Egypt, consisting of 10 AH-64E Apache Attack Helicopters, among other things. Beyond the United States, President Sisi has broadened Egypt's international base of support to include several key partners, including the Arab Gulf states, Israel, Russia, and France.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this detailed report about DOD's use of commercially hosted payloads. Let me start by understanding the main points of the report.\n\nFirst, the report defines a hosted payload as equipment integrated onto a host satellite, which uses the satellite's resources like size, weight, power, or communications. These can be experimental or operational. The report mentions that some missions might not be suitable for hosted payloads due to size, power, or maneuver requirements conflicting with the host's primary mission.\n\nThen, there are benefits listed: cost savings because the government only pays for part of the satellite and shared launch costs, faster on-orbit capability due to shorter development times for commercial satellites, increased deterrence and resilience by spreading capabilities across more satellites, and continual technology upgrades by using commercial satellites for government payloads.\n\nThe report also discusses the challenges in using hosted payloads, such as matching size, weight, power, and spectrum needs between the payload and host satellite. There are issues with timelines, budgeting, and cybersecurity. Additionally, there's a lack of centralized data and knowledge across DOD, leading to resistance in adopting this approach.\n\nThe report mentions that DOD has used hosted payloads for experimental missions, like the Commercially Hosted Infrared Payload (CHIRP) and the Responsive Environmental Assessment Commercially Hosted (REACH) effort, which saved significant costs. There are also planned missions that are expected to provide further cost savings and quicker on-orbit capabilities.\n\nHowever, the report points out that DOD has limited information on the costs and benefits of hosted payloads, which is fragmented across the agency. This lack of centralized data contributes to resistance in adopting this approach. The report also highlights the need for DOD to develop standard metrics for resilience and to consolidate knowledge from various programs.\n\nThe report concludes that while there are potential benefits to using commercially hosted payloads, DOD needs to improve its data collection and analysis to make informed decisions. It recommends that the Secretary of Defense require programs using hosted payloads to share cost and technical data with a central office, possibly the Hosted Payload Office, to better assess the viability of this approach for meeting warfighter needs.\n\nI need to condense all this into a one-page summary, making sure to highlight the key points: definition of hosted payloads, benefits (cost, speed, deterrence), challenges (technical, procedural, data), and the recommendation for centralized data collection. Also, mention the examples of successful missions and the current state of DOD's use of hosted", "answers": ["Each year, DOD spends billions of dollars to develop, produce, and field large, complex satellites. For such satellite systems, a single adversary attack or on-orbit failure can result in the loss of billions of dollars of investment and significant loss of vital capabilities. As DOD plans new space systems and addresses an increasingly contested space environment, it has the opportunity to consider different acquisition approaches. One such approach is to integrate a government sensor or payload onto a commercial host satellite. House Armed Services Committee report 115-200, accompanying a bill for the Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, included a provision for GAO to review DOD's use of commercially hosted payloads. This report (1) determines the extent to which DOD uses commercially hosted payloads and (2) describes and assesses factors that affect their use. GAO reviewed DOD policies, documentation, and planning documents, and interviewed a wide range of DOD and civil government officials, and commercial stakeholders. GAO and others have found that using commercial satellites to host government sensors or communications packages—called payloads—may be one way DOD can achieve on-orbit capability faster and more affordably. Using hosted payloads may also help facilitate a proliferation of payloads on orbit, making it more difficult for an adversary to defeat a capability. Since 2009, DOD has used three commercially hosted payloads, with three more missions planned or underway through 2022 (see figure below). DOD estimates that it has achieved cost savings of several hundred million dollars from using commercially hosted payloads to date, and expects to realize additional savings and deliver faster capabilities on orbit from planned missions. Cost savings can result from sharing development, launch, and ground system costs with the commercial host company. Among the factors that affect DOD's use of hosted payloads are a perception among some DOD officials that matching government payloads to commercial satellites is too difficult; and limited, fragmented knowledge on how to mitigate various challenges GAO found that further opportunities to use hosted payloads may emerge as DOD plans new and follow-on space systems in the coming years. However, DOD's knowledge on using hosted payloads is fragmented, in part because programs are not required to share information. In 2011, the Air Force created a Hosted Payload Office to provide expertise and other tools to facilitate matching government payloads with commercial hosts. However, GAO found that DOD programs using hosted payloads are not required and generally do not provide cost and technical data, or lessons learned, to the Hosted Payload Office, or another central office for analysis. Requiring programs that use hosted payloads agency-wide to provide this information to a central location would better position DOD to make informed decisions when considering acquisition approaches for upcoming space system designs. GAO recommends that DOD require programs using commercially hosted payloads to contribute resulting data to a central location. In implementing this recommendation, DOD should assess whether the Air Force's Hosted Payload Office is the appropriate location to collect and analyze the data.

{"pred": " The report examines the demographic trends in the technology workforce from 2005 to 2015 and evaluates the efforts of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) to ensure compliance with equal employment opportunity and affirmative action requirements for technology companies and contractors. Key findings include the following: The technology sector, defined by industries with the highest concentration of technology workers, includes the San Francisco Bay area, the greater New York City region, and the Washington-Arlington-Alexandria region. Technology workers are also employed in non-technology sectors, such as retail and financial services, where their roles may involve managing online sales activities. The technology workforce has grown significantly, with an estimated 7.5 million workers in 2015, representing a 24 percent increase from 2005. However, the representation of women, Black, and Hispanic workers in the technology workforce has remained lower compared to their representation in the general workforce. In 2015, women represented 22 percent of technology workers, while they made up 48.7 percent of the general workforce. Similarly, Black and Hispanic workers had lower representation in the technology workforce compared to their representation in the general workforce. While the percentage of minority technology workers as a whole had grown since 2005, this trend did not apply to Black technology workers. Specifically, from 2005 through 2015, although the number of Black workers increased as the technology workforce grew, there was no statistically significant change in their representation as a percentage of the entire technology workforce. In contrast, Hispanic and Asian technology workers had statistically significant increases in their representation in the technology workforce. Even with the increase in their numbers in the technology workforce, Black and Hispanic technology workers remained a smaller proportion of these workers compared to their representation in the general workforce. In contrast, Asian workers were an increasing share of the technology workforce, where they remained more represented than they were in the general workforce. The report also highlights the challenges faced by EEOC and OFCCP in their oversight of technology companies. For example, EEOC has not been consistently capturing information on industry codes, which hinders its ability to conduct industry sector analysis that could be used to more effectively focus its limited enforcement resources and outreach activities. OFCCP faces delays in receiving information from federal contractors, including technology companies, which hinders its ability to determine whether discrimination", "answers": ["Technology companies are a major source of high-paying U.S. jobs, but some have questioned the sector's commitment to equal employment opportunity. EEOC provides federal oversight of nondiscrimination requirements by investigating charges of discrimination, and OFCCP enforces federal contractors' compliance with affirmative action requirements. GAO was asked to review workforce trends in the technology sector and federal oversight. This report examines (1) trends in the gender, racial, and ethnic composition of the technology sector workforce; and (2) EEOC and OFCCP oversight of technology companies' compliance with equal employment and affirmative action requirements. GAO analyzed workforce data from the American Community Survey for 2005-2015 and EEOC Employer Information Reports for 2007-2015, the latest data available during our analysis. GAO analyzed OFCCP data on compliance evaluations for fiscal years 2011-2016. GAO interviewed agency officials, researchers, and workforce, industry, and company representatives. The estimated percentage of minority technology workers increased from 2005 to 2015, but GAO found that no growth occurred for female and Black workers, whereas Asian and Hispanic workers made statistically significant increases (see figure). Further, female, Black, and Hispanic workers remain a smaller proportion of the technology workforce—mathematics, computing, and engineering occupations—compared to their representation in the general workforce. These groups have also been less represented among technology workers inside the technology sector than outside it. In contrast, Asian workers were more represented in these occupations than in the general workforce. Stakeholders and researchers GAO interviewed identified several factors that may have contributed to the lower representation of certain groups, such as fewer women and minorities graduating with technical degrees and company hiring and retention practices. Both the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) have taken steps to enforce equal employment and affirmative action requirements in the technology sector, but face limitations. While EEOC has identified barriers to recruitment and hiring in the technology sector as a strategic priority, when EEOC conducts investigations, it does not systematically record the type of industry, therefore limiting sector-related analyses to help focus its efforts. EEOC has plans to determine how to add missing industry codes but has not set a timeframe to do this. In addition, OFCCP's regulations may hinder its ability to enforce contractors' compliance because OFCCP directs contractors to set placement goals for all minorities as a group rather than for specific racial/ethnic groups. OFCCP also has not made changes to its establishment-based approach to selecting entities for review in decades, even though changes have occurred in how workplaces are structured. Without taking steps to address these issues, OFCCP may miss opportunities to hold contractors responsible for complying with affirmative action and nondiscrimination requirements. GAO makes 6 recommendations, including that EEOC develop a timeline to improve industry data collection and OFCCP take steps toward requiring more specific minority placement goals by contractors and assess key aspects of its selection approach. EEOC neither agreed nor disagreed with its recommendation, and OFCCP stated the need for regulatory change to alter placement goal requirements.

{"pred": " The report discusses the CHIP-IN Act, a pilot program that allows the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to partner with private donors to address infrastructure needs. The program was initiated in response to an Omaha donor group's interest in constructing an ambulatory care center, which could help veterans in the area. The VA had allocated $56 million for the design of a replacement medical center, but due to a backlog of construction projects, the replacement medical center was not among its near-term projects. The Omaha donor group proposed a change in the scope of the project from a replacement medical center to a smaller-scope project for a new ambulatory care center that could potentially be constructed using the existing appropriation of $56 million plus a donation from the Omaha donor group. The CHIP-IN Act authorized a total of five pilot projects but did not name any specific project locations. The Omaha donor group applied to participate in the pilot program with the construction of an ambulatory care center, and VA executed a donation agreement in April 2017. The CHIP-IN Act places certain requirements on donations under the pilot program, including that the property has already received appropriations for a VA facility project or has been identified as a need as part of VA’s long-range capital planning process. The report also highlights the challenges faced by the VA in implementing the CHIP-IN pilot program, including the need for clear objectives, an assessment methodology, and an evaluation plan to determine the scalability of the program. The report notes that while the VA has made progress in the implementation of the CHIP-IN pilot program, there are still gaps in the program's design that need to be addressed. The report concludes with three recommendations for the VA to improve the implementation of the CHIP-IN pilot program. The first recommendation is for the VA to ensure that internal stakeholders agree to and document clear, measurable objectives for the pilot program. The second recommendation is for the VA to ensure that internal stakeholders develop an assessment methodology and an evaluation plan that are linked to the pilot program's objectives and that help inform decisions about the scalability of the program. The third recommendation is for the VA to ensure that the CHIP-IN steering committee documents the roles and responsibilities of its members and identifies available staff resources, including any additional expertise and skills needed to implement the CHIP-IN pilot program. The report also discusses the benefits of the CHIP-IN pilot program, including potential cost and time savings, and the opportunity to learn about private sector practices that could be applied more broadly to VA construction.

The Communities Helping Invest through Property and Improvements Needed for Veterans Act of 2016 (CHIP-IN Act) authorized VA to accept donated real property—such as buildings or facility construction or improvements—through a pilot program. VA has initiated one project in Omaha, Nebraska, through a partnership with a donor group. VA can accept up to five donations through the pilot program, which is authorized through 2021. The CHIP-IN Act includes a provision for GAO to report on donation agreements. This report (1) examines the extent to which the VA's pilot design aligns with leading practices and (2) discusses what VA has learned from the pilot to date. GAO reviewed VA documents, including plans for the pilot program, and visited the Omaha pilot project. GAO interviewed VA officials, the Omaha donor group, and three non-federal entities that responded to VA's request seeking donors. GAO compared implementation of VA's pilot to leading practices for pilot design, organizational transformation, and cross-functional teams. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is conducting a pilot program, called CHIP-IN, that allows VA to partner with non-federal entities and accept real property donations from them as a way to help address VA's infrastructure needs. Although VA signed its first project agreement under the program in April 2017, VA has not yet established a framework for effective design of the pilot program. Specifically, VA's pilot program design is not aligned with four of five leading practices for designing a well-developed and documented pilot program. VA has begun to implement one leading practice by improving its efforts to communicate with relevant stakeholders, such as including external stakeholders in key meetings. However, the VA offices involved have not agreed upon and documented clear, measurable objectives for the pilot program, which is a leading practice. Further, VA has not developed an assessment methodology or an evaluation plan that would help inform decisions about whether or how the pilot approach could be expanded. While VA officials said they intend to develop these items as tasks for the newly formed CHIP-IN steering committee, they have no timeline for doing so. Without clear objectives and assessment and evaluation plans, VA and Congress may have difficulty determining whether the pilot approach is an effective way to help address VA's infrastructure needs. To date, the CHIP-IN pilot suggests that donation partnerships could improve construction projects, but identifying donors and establishing a team for the pilot program have presented challenges. Officials from VA and the donor group for the first pilot project—an ambulatory care center in Omaha, Nebraska—said they are completing the project faster than if it had been a standard federal construction project, while achieving potential cost savings by using private sector practices. However, VA officials said it is challenging to find partners to make large donations with no financial return, and VA's lack of marketing and philanthropic development experience exacerbates that challenge. VA and the donor group agreed that a dedicated team of individuals with relevant expertise could facilitate the pilot's implementation. The new CHIP-IN steering committee could serve this purpose, but it lacks documented roles and responsibilities. Establishing a team with clear roles and responsibilities and identifying both available and needed staff resources could assist VA in partnering with additional donors and creating new opportunities to meet veterans' needs.

HUD is primarily responsible for enforcing lead paint regulations in rental assistance programs, including the Housing Choice Voucher and public housing programs. The report discusses HUD's lead hazard control grant programs, which are funded by the federal government and require matching contributions from state, local, and private funds. These programs aim to reduce the risk of lead poisoning in children by addressing lead hazards in housing. The report also examines HUD's efforts to monitor and enforce compliance with lead paint regulations for public housing agencies (PHAs), including the use of databases to track lead hazards and cases of elevated blood lead levels in children. HUD has taken steps to strengthen compliance monitoring processes, but the report identifies several limitations, including reliance on PHA self-certifications and lack of comprehensive data for the voucher program. Additionally, HUD has not fully documented its rationale for awarding lead grants and the decision-making process for determining grant award amounts. The report also highlights HUD's efforts to adopt federal health guidelines and environmental standards for lead hazards in its lead grant and rental assistance programs, including the alignment of HUD's standard for lead in a child's blood with CDC's blood lead reference value. The report notes that HUD's lead inspection standard for public housing is more stringent than for voucher units, and HUD has not requested statutory authority to impose a more stringent inspection standard for the voucher program. The report further discusses HUD's efforts to measure, evaluate, and report on the performance of its lead hazard reduction efforts, including the lack of comprehensive performance goals and measures, and the absence of annual reports on the results of HUD's lead efforts since 1997. The report concludes with nine recommendations to HUD, including the need to document and evaluate grant processes, identify areas at risk for lead hazards, monitor and enforce compliance with lead paint regulations, amend the inspection standard in the voucher program, assess and report on performance, and ensure statutory reporting requirements are met. These recommendations aim to improve HUD's effectiveness in addressing lead paint hazards and protecting children in low-income housing from lifelong health problems.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of the given report.

This report examines HUD’s efforts to (1) incorporate statutory requirements and other relevant federal standards in its lead grant programs, (2) monitor and enforce compliance with lead paint regulations in its rental assistance programs, (3) adopt federal health guidelines and environmental standards for its lead grant and rental assistance programs, and (4) measure and report on the performance of its lead efforts. GAO reviewed HUD documents and data related to its grant programs, compliance efforts, performance measures, and reporting. GAO also interviewed HUD staff and some grantees. The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) lead grant and rental assistance programs have taken steps to address lead paint hazards, but opportunities exist for improvement. For example, in 2016, HUD began using new tools to monitor how public housing agencies comply with lead paint regulations. However, HUD could further improve efforts in the following areas: Lead grant programs. While its recent grant award processes incorporate statutory requirements on applicant eligibility and selection criteria, HUD has not fully documented or evaluated these processes. For example, HUD’s guidance is not sufficiently detailed to ensure consistent and appropriate grant award decisions. Better documentation and evaluation of HUD’s grant program processes could help ensure that lead grants reach areas at risk of lead paint hazards. Further, HUD has not developed specific time frames for using available local-level data to better identify areas of the country at risk for lead paint hazards, which could help HUD target its limited resources. Oversight. HUD does not have a plan to mitigate and address risks related to noncompliance with lead paint regulations by public housing agencies. We identified several limitations with HUD’s monitoring efforts, including reliance on public housing agencies’ self-certifying compliance with lead paint regulations and challenges identifying children with elevated blood lead levels. Additionally, HUD lacks detailed procedures for addressing noncompliance consistently and in a timely manner. Developing a plan and detailed procedures to address noncompliance with lead paint regulations could strengthen HUD’s oversight of public housing agencies. Inspections. The lead inspection standard for the Housing Choice Voucher program is less strict than that of the public housing program. By requesting and obtaining statutory authority to amend the standard for the voucher program, HUD would be positioned to take steps to better protect children in voucher units from lead exposure as indicated by analysis of benefits and costs. Performance assessment and reporting. HUD lacks comprehensive goals and performance measures for its lead reduction efforts. In addition, it has not complied with annual statutory reporting requirements, last reporting as required on its lead efforts in 1997. Without better performance assessment and reporting, HUD cannot fully assess the effectiveness of its lead efforts. GAO makes nine recommendations to HUD including to improve lead grant program and compliance monitoring processes, request authority to amend its lead inspection standard in the voucher program, and take additional steps to report on progress. HUD generally agreed with eight of the recommendations. HUD disagreed that it should request authority to use a specific, stricter inspection standard.

The report outlines the key provisions of GPRAMA, including the establishment of cross-agency priority (CAP) goals, agency priority goals (APGs), and strategic objectives. These goals are intended to focus federal efforts on key outcomes and improve accountability for results. The report also discusses the implementation of GPRAMA, highlighting areas where progress has been made and where additional action is needed. For example, the report notes that while agencies have made progress in identifying and addressing major management challenges, many of the recommendations related to the federal program inventory remain unimplemented. The report also highlights the importance of using performance information in decision making, noting that while some progress has been made in this area, there is still room for improvement. The report concludes with four recommendations for the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to address ongoing issues related to the implementation of GPRAMA. These recommendations include updating the Performance.gov website to clarify the suspension of quarterly reporting on CAP goals and APGs, providing time frames and milestones for implementing the federal program inventory, and expanding the use of data-driven performance reviews beyond APGs to include other performance goals and at lower levels within agencies. The report emphasizes the need for continued improvement in the implementation of GPRAMA to address key governance challenges and enhance the performance of the federal government.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report on GPRAMA.

It's part of a framework established in the 1990s under GPRA. The main components of GPRAMA are CAP goals, APGs, and strategic objectives. These are meant to improve accountability and results by focusing on cross-cutting issues and using performance data effectively.\n\nThe report also discusses the implementation of GPRAMA, highlighting both progress and areas needing improvement. For example, agencies have made some progress in identifying and addressing major management challenges, but many recommendations remain unimplemented. The report mentions that OMB has postponed the implementation of the federal program inventory, which is supposed to be updated regularly to reflect current budget and performance information. \n\nThere are several recommendations made to OMB, including updating the Performance.gov website to clarify the suspension of quarterly reporting on CAP goals", "answers": ["Full implementation of GPRAMA could facilitate efforts to reform the federal government and make it more effective. GPRAMA includes a provision for GAO to review the act's implementation. This report assesses how GPRAMA implementation has affected the federal government's progress in resolving key governance challenges in (1) addressing cross-cutting issues, (2) ensuring performance information is useful and used, (3) aligning daily operations with results, and (4) building a more transparent and open government. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed statutory requirements, OMB guidance, and GAO's recent work related to GPRAMA implementation and the key governance challenges. GAO also interviewed OMB staff and surveyed a stratified random sample of 4,395 federal managers from 24 agencies on various performance and management topics. With a 67 percent response rate, the survey results are generalizable to the government-wide population of managers. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and agencies have made some progress in more fully implementing the GPRA Modernization Act (GPRAMA), but GAO's work and 2017 survey of federal managers highlight numerous areas where improvements are needed. Cross-cutting issues: Various GPRAMA provisions are aimed at addressing cross-cutting issues, such as cross-agency and agency priority goals and related data-driven reviews of progress towards those goals. To ensure alignment with the current administration's priorities, OMB's 2017 guidance removed the priority status of those goals, which stopped quarterly data-driven reviews and related public progress reports until new goals are published. OMB plans to resume implementation of these provisions in February 2018. GPRAMA also requires OMB and agencies to implement an inventory of federal programs, which could help decision makers better identify and manage fragmentation, overlap, and duplication. OMB and agencies implemented the inventory once, in May 2013. In October 2014, GAO found several issues limited the usefulness of that inventory. Since then, OMB has postponed updating the inventory, citing among other reasons the passage of subsequent laws. OMB has yet to develop a systematic approach for resuming implementation of the inventory and specific time frames for doing so. A systematic approach to developing the inventory could help ensure it provides useful information for decision makers and the public. Performance information: Survey results show federal managers generally reported no improvements in their use of performance information in decision making for various management activities, or practices that can enhance such use, since GAO's 2013 survey. For example, the use of performance information to streamline programs to reduce duplicative activities (an estimated 33 percent in 2017) is statistically significantly lower relative to 2013 (44 percent). In contrast, managers who were familiar with and whose programs were subject to quarterly data-driven reviews reported that those reviews were used to make progress toward agency priority goals. Identifying and sharing practices to expand the use of such reviews—for other performance goals and at lower levels within agencies—could lead to increased use of performance information. Daily operations: Agencies have made progress in developing results-oriented cultures but need to take additional actions. GAO's past work found that high-performing organizations use performance management systems to help individuals connect their daily activities to organizational goals. In 2017, about half of federal managers reported using performance information when setting expectations with employees (no change from GAO's last survey in 2013). Transparent and open government: GAO's past work identified a number of needed improvements to Performance.gov, the central government-wide website required by GPRAMA. The site is to provide quarterly updates on priority goals in effect through September 2017, but those updates stopped in December 2016. According to OMB, the existing information for cross-agency priority goals is the final update, and agencies should publish final updates on their priority goals in annual performance reports. Performance.gov does not provide users with this information, thereby limiting the transparency and accessibility of those results. In addition to following through on plans to resume implementation of key GPRAMA provisions, GAO recommends that OMB (1) consider a systematic approach to developing the program inventory, (2) revise guidance to provide specific time frames for inventory implementation, (3) identify and share practices for expanding the use of data-driven reviews, and (4) update Performance.gov to explain that reporting on priority goals was suspended and provide the location of final progress updates.

{"pred": " The Colorado River Basin, spanning over 246,000 square miles and flowing through seven U.S. states and Mexico, is a critical water source for millions of people and diverse ecosystems. The Bureau of Reclamation, under the Department of the Interior, plays a central role in managing the basin's waters, including the operation of major storage and conveyance facilities. These facilities provide low-cost water and hydropower to users, with the Colorado River's flow and stored water being essential for agriculture, municipal and industrial (M&I) use, power production, fish and wildlife, and recreation. Approximately 70% of basin water is used for irrigation on 5.5 million acres, while M&I water supplies serve nearly 40 million people. The river's flow also supports trans-basin diversions to areas such as Cheyenne, WY; multiple cities in Colorado's Front Range; Provo, UT; Albuquerque and Santa Fe, NM; and Los Angeles, San Diego, and the Imperial Valley in Southern California. The river's hydropower facilities can generate up to 42 gigawatts of electricity annually. The river also provides habitat for numerous species, including several federally endangered species, and flows through 7 national wildlife refuges and 11 National Park Service units. Precipitation and runoff in the basin are highly variable, with water conditions largely dependent on snowmelt in the northern areas. Observed data from 1906 to 2018 show that natural flows in the 20th century averaged about 14.8 million acre-feet (MAF) annually. Flows have dipped significantly during the current drought, which dates to 2000; natural flows from 2000 to 2018 averaged approximately 12.4 MAF per year. In 2018, Reclamation estimated that the 19-year period from 2000 to 2018 was the driest period in more than 100 years of record keeping. The dry conditions are consistent with prior droughts in the basin that were identified through tree ring studies; some of these droughts lasted for decades. Climate change impacts, including warmer temperatures and altered precipitation patterns, may further increase the likelihood of prolonged drought in the basin. Pursuant to the multiple compacts, federal laws, court decisions and decrees, contracts, and regulatory guidelines governing Colorado River operations (collectively known as", "answers": ["The Colorado River Basin covers more than 246,000 square miles in seven U.S. states (Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and California) and Mexico. Pursuant to federal law, the Bureau of Reclamation (part of the Department of the Interior) manages much of the basin's water supplies. Colorado River water is used primarily for agricultural irrigation and municipal and industrial (M&I) uses, but it also is important for power production, fish and wildlife, and recreational uses. In recent years, consumptive uses of Colorado River water have exceeded natural flows. This causes an imbalance in the basin's available supplies and competing demands. A drought in the basin dating to 2000 has raised the prospect of water delivery curtailments and decreased hydropower production, among other things. In the future, observers expect that increasing demand for supplies, coupled with the effects of climate change, will further increase the strain on the basin's limited water supplies. River Management The Law of the River is the commonly used shorthand for the multiple laws, court decisions, and other documents governing Colorado River operations. The foundational document of the Law of the River is the Colorado River Compact of 1922. Pursuant to the compact, the basin states established a framework to apportion the water supplies between the Upper and Lower Basins of the Colorado River, with the dividing line between the two basins at Lee Ferry, AZ (near the Utah border). The Upper and Lower Basins each were allocated 7.5 million acre-feet (MAF) annually under the Colorado River Compact; an additional 1.5 MAF in annual flows was made available to Mexico under a 1944 treaty. Future agreements and court decisions addressed numerous other issues (including intrastate allocations of flows), and subsequent federal legislation provided authority and funding for federal facilities that allowed users to develop their allocations. A Supreme Court ruling also confirmed that Congress designated the Secretary of the Interior as the water master for the Lower Basin, a role in which the federal government manages the delivery of all water below Hoover Dam. Reclamation and basin stakeholders closely track the status of two large reservoirs—Lake Powell in the Upper Basin and Lake Mead in the Lower Basin—as an indicator of basin storage conditions. Under recent guidelines, dam releases from these facilities are tied to specific water storage levels. For Lake Mead, the first tier of \"shortage,\" under which Arizona's and Nevada's allocations would be decreased, would be triggered if Lake Mead's January 1 elevation is expected to fall below 1,075 feet above mean sea level. As of early 2019, Reclamation projected that there was a 69% chance of a shortage condition at Lake Mead in 2020; there was also a lesser chance of Lake Powell reaching critically low levels. Improved hydrology in early 2019 may decrease the chances of shortage in the immediate future. Drought Contingency Plans Despite previous efforts to alleviate future shortages, the basin's hydrological outlook has generally worsened in recent years. After several years of negotiations, in early 2019 Reclamation and the basin states transmitted to Congress additional plans to alleviate stress on basin water supplies. These plans, known as the drought contingency plans (DCPs) for the Upper and Lower Basins, were authorized by Congress in April 2019 in the Colorado River Drought Contingency Plan Authorization Act (P.L. 116-14). The DCPs among other things obligate Lower Basin states to additional water supply cutbacks at specified storage levels (i.e., cutbacks beyond previous curtailment plans), commit Reclamation to additional water conservation efforts, and coordinate Upper Basin operations to protect Lake Powell storage levels and hydropower generation. Congressional Role Congress plays a multifaceted role in federal management of the Colorado River basin. Congress funds and oversees management of basin facilities, including operations and programs to protect and restore endangered species. It has also enacted and continues to consider Indian water rights settlements involving Colorado River waters and development of new water storage facilities in the basin. In addition, Congress has approved funding to mitigate water shortages and conserve basin water supplies and has enacted new authorities to combat drought and its effects on basin water users (i.e., the DCPs and other related efforts)."], "all_classes": null, "length": 7367}

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points. \n\nThe report talks about how the federal government gets money besides taxes. It mentions user fees, fines, and penalties. In fiscal year 2017, the total receipts were $3.3 trillion, with over $350 billion from these sources. The report explains the different types of collections: offsetting collections, offsetting receipts, and governmental receipts.

However, there are challenges in collecting and reporting detailed data on fees, fines, and penalties. The report points out that the current data sources, like OMB's MAX database, have some disaggregated data but aren't publicly available. \n\nThere are recommendations for OMB to improve transparency by making more data accessible, describing the criteria for identifying", "answers": ["Congress has authorized federal agencies to collect hundreds of billions of dollars annually in fees, fines, and penalties. These collections can fund a variety of programs, including programs related to national security, and the protection of natural resources. Data on collections are important for congressional oversight and to provide transparency in agencies' use of federal resources. GAO was asked to review the availability of government-wide data on fees, fines, and penalties. This report examines (1) the extent to which data on collections of fees, fines, and penalties are publically available and useful for the purpose of congressional oversight; and (2) the benefits and challenges to government-wide reporting of fees, fines, and penalties. GAO assessed government-wide fee, fine, and penalty data against criteria for availability and usefulness based on multiple sources, including prior GAO work and input from staff of selected congressional committees. GAO interviewed OMB staff, Treasury officials, and representatives of organizations with expertise in federal budget issues and reviewed prior GAO work to identify benefits and challenges of reporting these data. There are no comprehensive, government-wide data at the level of detail that identifies specific fees, fines, or penalties. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) report data that include these collections at the budget account level, which generally covers a set of agency activities or programs. OMB and Treasury also report some summary data for budgeting and financial management purposes. In the Budget of the U.S. Government , for example, OMB data showed government-wide fees totaled just over $335 billion in fiscal year 2017. These reports, however, are not designed to inventory or analyze fee, fine, or penalty collections and have significant limitations for that purpose. Although OMB collects more disaggregated data on fees, fines, and penalties, it does not make the data publicly available. OMB uses the disaggregated data in its OMB MAX database—such as the agency and account—to compile reported totals, such as the government-wide fees total in the Budget of the U.S. Government . Until OMB makes more disaggregated data publicly available, Congress has limited information on collections by agency to inform oversight and decision-making. OMB's government-wide total of fees includes collections that are not fees and excludes some fee collections. The total includes all collections for accounts in which fees make up at least half of the account's collections and excludes all others. OMB does not direct agencies to regularly review and update the accounts included in the total. Therefore, if accounts' makeups change such that fee collections drop below, or rise above, the 50 percent threshold, accounts may have incorrect fee designations and the total may be inaccurate. Further, OMB does not disclose the limitation that the total may exclude some fees and include other collections that are not fees. As a result, some users of the data are likely unaware of the potential for the total fees to be overestimated or underestimated. Further, no source of government-wide data consistently reports data elements on fees, fines, and penalties that could help inform congressional oversight. Generally, congressional staff told us that additional data, such as amounts of specific penalties, would increase transparency and facilitate oversight. These data could help Congress identify trends in collections and significant changes that could be an indication of an agency's performance. While reporting government-wide fee, fine, and penalty data provides benefits, there are trade-offs in terms of the time and federal resources it would take to develop and implement a process for agencies to report these data. The level of federal investment would vary depending on factors, such as the number of data elements included and the level of detail reported. Developing a comprehensive and accessible data source would provide greater benefits, but would likely be resource intensive. Alternatively, incorporating a small number of data elements that Congress identifies as most useful for oversight into ongoing government-wide reporting efforts could incrementally improve transparency and information for oversight and decision-making, with fewer resources.

The SBA also manages several subprograms, including the SBAExpress, Export Express, and Community Advantage programs, which offer streamlined and expedited loan procedures for specific groups of borrowers. These subprograms have their own eligibility requirements, terms, and benefits but operate under the 7(a) program's authorization.

Administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), the program operates through a network of state agencies and local sponsors, including schools, community centers, and nonprofit organizations. The SFSP aims to provide nutritious meals to children in low-income areas during periods when school is not in session, such as summer vacation, and in cases of unexpected school closures due to natural disasters.\n\nThe report highlights that the SFSP has seen an increase in the number of meals served over the past decade, with a notable 32% increase from fiscal year 2007 to 2016. However, there was a slight decrease in fiscal years 2015 and 2016, attributed to factors such as changes in funding for summer programs, sponsor participation, weather, and the number of weekdays available for sites to serve meals. The program's primary focus is on summer meals, with the majority of meals served during this period.\n\nThe report also discusses the challenges faced by the SFSP, including the reliability of participation estimates, which are based on inconsistent state calculations. These estimates are crucial for program implementation, strategic planning, and outreach to areas with low participation. Additionally, the report identifies challenges in providing summer meals to children, such as ensuring meal sites are in safe locations and managing administrative requirements when participating in multiple child nutrition programs.\n\nThe SFSP has been supported by federal, state, and local entities through various initiatives, including the provision of flexibilities in meal delivery and administrative simplifications. The report also highlights the importance of nonfederal programs in providing meals to low-income children during the summer, despite the challenges in data collection and program administration.\n\nThe report concludes with four recommendations for FNS to improve the SFSP, including enhancing the estimate of children's participation, communicating the circumstances under which flexibilities are granted, evaluating the use of flexibilities, and disseminating information on administrative simplifications.

Russell National School Lunch Act**,", "answers": ["The SFSP, a federal nutrition assistance program, is intended to provide food to children in low-income areas during periods when area schools are closed for vacation. In the last decade, federal expenditures for SFSP have increased as the program has expanded, according to USDA data. GAO was asked to review the SFSP. This report examines (1) what is known about SFSP participation, (2) other programs that help feed low-income children over the summer, and (3) challenges, if any, in providing summer meals to children and the extent to which USDA provides assistance to address these challenges. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed USDA's SFSP data for fiscal years 2007 through 2016; surveyed state agencies responsible for administering the SFSP in 50 states and the District of Columbia; visited a nongeneralizable group of 3 states and 30 meal sites, selected based on Census data on child poverty rates and urban and rural locations; analyzed meal site data from the 3 states; and interviewed USDA, state and national organization officials, and SFSP providers, including sponsors and site operators. Nationwide, the total number of meals served to children in low-income areas through the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) increased from 113 to 149 million (about 32 percent) from fiscal year 2007 through 2016. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) directs states to use the number of meals served, along with other data, to estimate the number of children participating in the SFSP. However, participation estimates have been calculated inconsistently from state to state and year to year. In 2017, USDA took steps to improve the consistency of participation estimates, noting they are critical for informing program implementation and strategic planning. However, GAO determined that the method USDA directs states to use will continue to provide unreliable estimates of participation, hindering USDA's ability to use them for these purposes. Other federal and nonfederal programs help feed low-income children over the summer to some extent, according to states GAO surveyed and SFSP providers and others GAO interviewed. For example, in July 2016, USDA data indicate about 26 million meals were served through a separate federal program that allows school meal providers to serve summer meals. Some children also received summer meals through nonfederal programs operated by faith-based organizations and foodbanks, though GAO's state survey and interviews with providers and national organizations indicate the reach of such efforts is limited. States and SFSP providers reported challenges with meal sites, participation, and program administration; USDA has taken steps to address these areas. Specifically, in GAO's survey, a majority of states reported challenges with availability and awareness of meal sites, as well as limited program participation and administrative capacity. National, state, and local officials have taken steps to address these issues, such as increasing outreach and offering activities to attract participation. In addition, 17 states in GAO's survey and providers in the states GAO visited reported a challenge with ensuring meal sites are in safe locations. To address this safety issue, USDA has granted some states and sponsors flexibility from the requirement that children consume meals on-site. However, USDA has not broadly communicated the circumstances it considers when granting this flexibility. Further, some states and sponsors that have requested this flexibility reported difficulty obtaining data to show these circumstances exist, hampering their ability to ensure safe meal delivery.

Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. \n\nThe report is from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and discusses Medicare's program integrity, focusing on fraud, waste, and abuse. It mentions that Medicare is the largest CMS program, costing $702 billion in 2017, with projected outlays of $1.5 trillion by 2028. The report talks about the challenges in detecting fraud due to its intentional nature and the complexity of the program. \n\nThe GAO points out that Medicare was designated a high-risk program in 1990 because of its size, scope, and complexity. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) also labeled parts of Medicare as high priority due to improper payments. However, the report states that improper payments aren't a direct measure of fraud. \n\nThe report discusses the Fraud Risk Framework, which is a guide for agencies to manage fraud risks. It includes four components: commit, assess, design and implement, and evaluate and adapt. The report mentions that CMS has some efforts in place, like the Center for Program Integrity (CPI), which works with stakeholders to address fraud. However, CMS hasn't conducted a comprehensive fraud risk assessment for Medicare as a whole. \n\nThe report also highlights that CMS has not developed a risk-based antifraud strategy, which is needed to align with the Fraud Risk Framework. There are some monitoring and evaluation mechanisms in place, but they could be improved to support a more effective antifraud strategy. \n\nAdditionally, the report points out that CMS has not provided required fraud-awareness training for all employees, which is a gap in their current approach. While some training is offered to stakeholders and specific groups, the majority of CMS employees aren't receiving this training. \n\nThe report also mentions that CMS has taken steps to identify fraud risks in Medicare, such as using data analytics and collaborating with contractors and law enforcement. However, without a fraud risk assessment, the agency can't prioritize the most significant risks. \n\nThe GAO recommends that CMS conduct fraud risk assessments for Medicare and Medicaid, develop risk-based antifraud strategies, and implement monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. These steps would help in managing the program's risks more effectively. \n\nIn summary, the report emphasizes the need for CMS to strengthen its program integrity efforts, particularly in addressing fraud, waste, and abuse. It highlights the importance of conducting comprehensive fraud risk assessments", "answers": ["Medicare covered over 58 million people in 2017 and has wide-ranging impact on the health-care sector and the overall U.S. economy. However, the billions of dollars in Medicare outlays as well as program complexity make it susceptible to improper payments, including fraud. Although there are no reliable estimates of fraud in Medicare, in fiscal year 2017 improper payments for Medicare were estimated at about $52 billion. Further, about $1.4 billion was returned to Medicare Trust Funds in fiscal year 2017 as a result of recoveries, fines, and asset forfeitures. In December 2017, GAO issued a report examining how CMS managed its fraud risks overall and particularly the extent to which its efforts in the Medicare and Medicaid programs aligned with GAO's Framework. This testimony, based on that report, discusses the extent to which CMS's management of fraud risks in Medicare aligns with the Framework. For the report, GAO reviewed CMS policies and interviewed officials and external stakeholders. In its December 2017 report, GAO found that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) antifraud efforts for Medicare partially align with GAO's 2015 A Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs (Framework). The Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015 required OMB to incorporate leading practices identified in this Framework in its guidance to agencies on addressing fraud risks. Consistent with the Framework, GAO determined that CMS had demonstrated commitment to combating fraud by creating a dedicated entity to lead antifraud efforts; the Center for Program Integrity (CPI) serves as this entity for fraud, waste, and abuse issues in Medicare. CMS also promoted an antifraud culture by, for example, coordinating with internal stakeholders to incorporate antifraud features into new program design. To increase awareness of fraud risks in Medicare, CMS offered and required training for stakeholder groups such as providers of medical services, but it did not offer or require similar fraud-awareness training for most of its workforce. CMS took some steps to identify fraud risks in Medicare; however, it had not conducted a fraud risk assessment or designed and implemented a risk-based antifraud strategy for Medicare as defined in the Framework. CMS identified fraud risks through control activities that target areas the agency designated as higher risk within Medicare, including specific provider types, such as home health agencies. Building on earlier steps and conducting a fraud risk assessment, consistent with the Framework, would provide the detailed information and insights needed to create a fraud risk profile, which, in turn, is the basis for creating an antifraud strategy. CMS established monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for its program-integrity control activities that, if aligned with an antifraud strategy, could enhance the effectiveness of fraud risk management in Medicare. For example, CMS used return-on-investment and savings estimates to measure the effectiveness of its Medicare program-integrity activities. In developing an antifraud strategy, consistent with the Framework, CMS could include plans for refining and building on existing methods such as return-on-investment, to evaluate the effectiveness of all of its antifraud efforts. In its December 2017 report, GAO made three recommendations, namely that CMS (1) require and provide fraud-awareness training to its employees; (2) conduct fraud risk assessments; and (3) create an antifraud strategy for Medicare, including an approach for evaluation. The Department of Health and Human Services agreed with these recommendations and reportedly is evaluating options to implement them. Accordingly, the recommendations remain open."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5746}
{"pred": " (One page, 500 words)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about the Social Security Administration (SSA). Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points.\n\nThe report starts by explaining SSA's mission and the three main programs they administer: Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI), Disability Insurance (DI), and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). It gives the 2019 budget figures for each program, like $892 billion for OASI, $149 billion for DI, and $59 billion for SSI. Then it talks about the importance of IT systems for managing these programs, mentioning the volume of transactions and the challenges in IT management.\n\nThe report also discusses the SSA's efforts to modernize its IT infrastructure, including projects like the Disability Case Processing System. However, there have been issues with software quality and system performance. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has placed this initiative on a list of high-priority programs needing attention.\n\nThere's a mention of FITARA (Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act) from 2014, which aimed to improve IT acquisitions and enable Congress to monitor agencies' progress. The report also references Executive Order 13833 from 2018, which enhances the role of CIOs in agencies, including SSA, to improve IT management and cybersecurity.\n\nThe report then goes into detail about various IT management areas that SSA has been working on, such as data center consolidation, incremental development, IT acquisitions, and software licenses. It mentions that while SSA has made progress in some areas, there are still challenges, especially in the role of the CIO in policy and management.\n\nThe summary needs to be concise, covering the main points: the SSA's programs, their financials, the importance of IT systems, the challenges in IT management, the initiatives to modernize, the impact of FITARA and the executive order, and the progress made in addressing these issues. Also, the report highlights that while SSA has implemented many recommendations, there are still areas where the CIO's role is not fully addressed, which is crucial for overcoming IT management challenges.\n\nI need to structure this into a coherent summary, making sure to highlight the key points without getting too detailed. Also, since it's a one-page summary, I should keep it around 500 words. Let me start by outlining the main sections: introduction of SSA's mission and programs, IT", "answers": ["SSA delivers services that touch the lives of almost every American, and relies heavily on IT resources to do so. Its systems support a range of activities, such as processing Disability Insurance payments, to calculating and withholding Medicare premiums, and issuing Social Security numbers and cards. For fiscal year 2018, the agency planned to spend approximately $1.6 billion on IT. GAO has previously reported that federal IT projects have often failed, in part, due to a lack of oversight and governance. Given the challenges that federal agencies, including SSA, have encountered in managing IT acquisitions, Congress and the administration have taken steps to improve federal IT, including enacting federal IT acquisition reform legislation and issuing related guidance. This statement summarizes GAO's previously reported findings regarding SSA's management of IT acquisitions and operations. In developing this testimony, GAO summarized findings from its reports issued in 2011 through 2018, and information on SSA's actions in response to GAO's recommendations. The Social Security Administration (SSA) has improved its management of information technology (IT) acquisitions and operations by addressing 14 of the 15 recommendations that GAO has made to the agency. For example, Incremental development . The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has emphasized the need for agencies to deliver IT investments in smaller increments to reduce risk and deliver capabilities more quickly. In November 2017, GAO reported that agencies, including SSA, needed to improve their certification of incremental development. As a result, GAO recommended that SSA's CIO (1) report incremental development information accurately, and (2) update its incremental development policy and processes. SSA implemented both recommendations. Software licenses . Effective management of software licenses can help avoid purchasing too many licenses that result in unused software. In May 2014, GAO reported that most agencies, including SSA, lacked comprehensive software license policies. As a result, GAO made six recommendations to SSA, to include developing a comprehensive software licenses policy and inventory. SSA implemented all six recommendations. However, SSA's IT management policies have not fully addressed the role of its CIO. Various laws and related guidance assign IT management responsibilities to CIOs in six key areas. In August 2018, GAO reported that SSA had fully addressed the role of the CIO in one of the six areas (see table). Specifically, SSA's policies fully addressed the CIO's role in the IT leadership and accountability area by requiring the CIO to report directly to the agency head, among other things. In contrast, SSA's policies did not address or minimally addressed the IT workforce and IT strategic planning areas. For example, SSA's policies did not include requirements for the CIO to annually assess the extent to which personnel meet IT management skill requirements or to measure how well IT supports agency programs. GAO recommended that SSA address the weaknesses in the remaining five key areas. SSA agreed with GAO's recommendation and stated that the agency plans to implement the recommendation by the end of this month. GAO has made 15 recommendations to SSA to improve its management of IT acquisitions and operations from 2011 through 2018, and 1 recommendation to improve its CIO policies. While SSA has implemented nearly all of them, it would be better positioned to overcome longstanding IT management challenges when it addresses the CIO's role in its policies."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3733}
{"pred": " (One page, 500 words)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is about federal user fees and how they are used to fund various government activities. It discusses the different types of fees, their purposes, and the implications of using fees versus taxes.\n\nFirst, the report explains that the federal government collects various fees from businesses and households. These fees are used to fund services, like national parks, and are part of the government's revenue. The report differentiates between fees that are tied to regulatory activities and those that are internal to the government, like the Office of Personnel Management charging other agencies for background checks.\n\nIt also mentions that some agencies, such as the SEC, FERC, PTO, and FTC, are largely or partially funded by user fees. In FY2017, user fees accounted for $331 billion, which is about 10% of total federal receipts. The report highlights that fees are voluntary, unlike taxes, which are compulsory. However, not paying fees can prevent certain activities, like international travel or issuing securities.\n\nThe report then discusses the administrative and economic consequences of using fees. It mentions that fees can be more efficient in some cases, as they link the cost to those who benefit. However, there are concerns about the political resistance to raising fees compared to taxes. Also, the flow of fees can be affected by economic conditions, making it harder to predict government funding.\n\nThe report also talks about the definitions of user fees and charges. The GAO defines a user fee as a fee assessed to users for goods or services provided by the federal government. The OMB includes transactions not normally considered fees, like land or asset sales. The report also explains that the federal government uses modified cash accounting, so when selling assets, the loss isn't recorded as a private firm would.\n\nThere's a discussion about the budgetary accounts and how user fees are categorized. The report mentions that the Budget Appendix provides detailed subaccount-level data, but it's not practical for government-wide research. Also, a comprehensive list of federal fees isn't publicly available.\n\nThe report goes into how user fees are classified in terms of budgetary accounts. Some are in the General Fund, others in special funds. Offsetting collections are subtracted from budget authority totals when evaluating compliance with budgetary controls. The report also mentions that some agencies, like the FDA, have expanded their reliance on user fees", "answers": ["The federal government collects various fees from businesses and households. Choosing to raise public funds via user fees, as opposed to other means such as taxes, has important administrative and economic consequences. Many fees stem from \"business-like activities,\" in which the government provides a service or benefit in return for payment. For example, many national parks charge entry fees, which then help fund maintenance projects. Such fees and charges that result from voluntary choices, such as entering a national park, are distinguished from taxes—which stem from the government's sovereign power to compel payments. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) defines a user fee as a \"fee assessed to users for goods or services provided by the federal government. User fees generally apply to federal programs or activities that provide special benefits to identifiable recipients above and beyond what is normally available to the public.\" User fees and charges have several advantages as a means of financing public activities. They are voluntary, they connect the burden of financing activities to those who directly benefit from them, and can help decentralize decisionmaking by bypassing centralized allocation of resources. Some have expressed concerns that user fee arrangements may bypass regular congressional scrutiny and dilute Congress's power of the purse. Collections of fees and charges may also be more sensitive to economic fluctuations, which could complicate financing of programs dependent on those revenue streams. Many user fees or charges are classified as offsetting collections, which are deposited into expenditure accounts. Offsetting collections can be used to offset agency spending and typically require no further congressional approval to use. Other fees and charges are classified as offsetting receipts, which are collected into revenue accounts and typically require congressional authorization to be spent. User fees and charges can be classified as discretionary or mandatory spending, depending on how they are legally authorized. The levels and administration of some fees are specified in detailed statutory text, while other fees are created under broader agency authorities. Certain agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have increased their reliance on user fees in past decades. Some critics have raised concerns that increased reliance on user fees could shift incentives facing those agencies. Some legislative proposals, such as H.R. 850 introduced in the 115th Congress, would limit or eliminate most exceptions and require most fees and charges to be deposited in the U.S. Treasury General Fund. Congress could fund agencies and activities now funded in whole or in part via user fees directly through the annual appropriations process. Such proposals would mark a departure from past practice. Statutory text governing many fees has evolved over many years and involves substantive policy decisions, often related to the industry or programmatic concerns. A general change in funding from user fees and charges to annual appropriations would likely shift the division of responsibilities between authorizing committees and appropriations committees. Congress may also enhance its oversight of agencies reliant on user fees by requiring more timely and detailed financial reports as well as more precise and systematic explanations of linkages between those fees and associated programs. Congress could also ask for greater transparency in fiscal data. While the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the U.S. Treasury Bureau of the Fiscal Service provide extensive data on user fees and charges, it is difficult to conduct governmentwide analyses using publicly available sources. Congress could mandate more detailed and more easily accessed data on user fees and charges. Additional funding may be needed to develop the capacity to issue those data."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4022}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is about the U.S. military base management, specifically how the President and Congress have different roles in managing and closing military installations. \n\nFirst, the Constitution doesn't clearly specify how military bases should be managed. Article II gives the President the role of commander-in-chief, which includes deploying and redeploying forces. However, Article I gives Congress the responsibility to raise armies and maintain a Navy. Over time, Congress has passed laws that limit the President's ability to close or realign bases, especially after the 1977 legislation. This led to the creation of the BRAC process, which is a structured way for the Department of Defense to handle base closures and realignments. \n\nThe BRAC process involves an independent commission that reviews the Secretary of Defense's recommendations. The commission can accept, reject, or modify the list of closures. The process has several steps, including the Secretary's submission of recommendations, the commission's review, and the President's approval. Congress can then disapprove the recommendations in their entirety. \n\nThe BRAC process has evolved over time. The first BRAC was in 1988, which was a success. Subsequent rounds in 1991, 1993, 1995, and 2005. The 2005 round was the largest and most complex, leading to significant costs. The report also discusses the cost savings from BRAC rounds, but there have been issues with the accuracy of these estimates. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has pointed out that the Department of Defense (DOD) has not properly tracked the costs and savings from previous BRAC rounds. \n\nThe report mentions that the BRAC process is the main way DOD disposes of excess infrastructure. Each year, the Department has requested a new BRAC round to achieve greater efficiency and reduce excess infrastructure. However, there have been concerns about the costs and complexity of previous rounds, which have led to some congressional reluctance to support new BRAC rounds. \n\nIn 2019, the Trump administration did not request a new BRAC round, instead focusing on internal reforms and preparing for a financial audit. They also proposed using the new in-state BRAC authorities, which allow the Secretary of Defense to close or realign bases with state and local support. \n\nThe report highlights", "answers": ["Since 1977, statutory thresholds have effectively constrained the President's ability to close or realign major military installations in the United States. Congress has instead periodically granted temporary authorities—known as a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC)—that have established independent commissions for the review and approval of basing changes submitted by the Secretary of Defense. These unique and transient authorities last expired on April 16, 2006. There have been five rounds of base closures: 1988, 1991, 1993, 1995, and 2005. Though Congress has periodically adjusted the BRAC process to account for lessons learned, the modern framework has remained generally consistent with earlier rounds, and includes establishment of an independent commission; reliance on objective and uniform criteria; Government Accountability Office (GAO) review and certification of Department of Defense (DOD) data; deliberations designed to be transparent that include open hearings, solicitation of feedback, installation visits, and data available for public review; and requirement that the final list of closure and realignment recommendations be accepted or rejected in their entirety. Congress has defined BRAC selection criteria in statute, thus requiring the Secretary to prioritize military value over cost savings. Additionally, Congress has required the Secretary to align the Department's recommendations with a comprehensive 20-year force structure plan. The commission may modify, reject, or add recommendations during its review before forwarding a final list to the President. After receiving the Commission's list of recommendations, the President may either accept the report in its entirety or seek to modify it by indicating disapproval and returning it to the commission for further evaluation. If the President accepts the commission's recommendations, they are forwarded to Congress. BRAC implementation begins by default unless Congress rejects the recommendations in their entirety within 45 days by enacting a joint resolution. During the implementation phase, DOD is required to initiate closures and realignments within two years and complete all actions within six years. The BRAC process represents a legislative compromise between the executive and legislative branches wherein each shares power in managing the closure and realignment of military bases. The imposition of an independent, third-party mediator was intended to insulate base closings from political considerations by both branches that had complicated similar actions in the past. This report provides background on the development of BRAC, describes its major elements and milestones, and outlines issues frequently cited in the context of new rounds, such as potential savings."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5035}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about Title IV of the Higher Education Act. Let me start by understanding the main points of the report. \n\nFirst, the report explains that Title IV authorizes financial aid programs for students attending eligible institutions. In 2016-2017, there were 6,760 Title IV eligible institutions, with a mix of public, private nonprofit, and proprietary (for-profit) types. The total amount of federal student aid available in FY2017 was $122.5 billion. \n\nThe report then goes into detail about the eligibility criteria for institutions to participate in Title IV programs. These criteria include state authorization, accreditation by an ED-recognized agency, and certification by the Department of Education. The state authorization ensures that the institution is legally allowed to operate in its state, while accreditation ensures quality education. The federal government's role is to oversee compliance, ensuring fiscal responsibility and administrative capability.\n\nThe report also discusses the different types of institutions under Title IV. Public institutions are those operated by states or government entities, primarily funded by public funds. Private nonprofit institutions are those owned by nonprofit corporations, tax-exempt under IRC 501(c)(3), and legally authorized in each state. Proprietary institutions must meet additional criteria, such as the 90/10 rule (at least 10% of revenue from non-Title IV funds) and offering programs that prepare students for gainful employment. \n\nThere are specific requirements for different types of institutions. For example, proprietary institutions must have a program that leads to a degree or prepares students for gainful employment. They also have to meet the 90/10 rule. Postsecondary vocational institutions must offer programs that prepare students for gainful employment and have been authorized to do so for at least two consecutive years. \n\nThe report also covers the program integrity triad: state authorization, accreditation, and federal certification. Each component has its own role in ensuring the quality and compliance of institutions. For example, state authorization is about legal authority to operate, accreditation is about quality assurance, and federal certification is about fiscal responsibility. \n\nOther important aspects include the definitions of institutions under HEA Sections 101 and 102. Section 101 applies to non-Title IV programs, while Section 102 is for Title IV participation. Section 102 includes all types of institutions, including foreign ones that have been approved", "answers": ["Title IV of the Higher Education Act (HEA) authorizes programs that provide financial assistance to students to assist them in obtaining a postsecondary education at certain institutions of higher education (IHEs). These IHEs include public, private nonprofit, and proprietary institutions. For students attending such institutions to be able to receive Title IV assistance, an institution must meet basic criteria, including offering at least one eligible program of education (e.g., programs leading to a degree or preparing a student for gainful employment in a recognized occupation). In addition, an IHE must satisfy the program integrity triad, under which it must be licensed or otherwise legally authorized to operate in the state in which it is physically located, accredited or preaccredited by an agency recognized for that purpose by the Department of Education (ED), and certified by ED as eligible to participate in Title IV programs. These requirements are intended to provide a balance between consumer protection, quality assurance, and oversight and compliance in postsecondary education providers participating in Title IV student aid programs. An IHE must also fulfill a variety of other related requirements, including those that relate to institutional recruiting practices, student policies and procedures, and the administration of the Title IV student aid programs. Finally, additional criteria may apply to an institution depending on its control or the type of educational programs it offers. For example, proprietary institutions must meet HEA requirements that are otherwise inapplicable to public and private nonprofit institutions, including deriving at least 10% of their revenues from non-Title IV funds (also known as the 90/10 rule). While an institution is ineligible to participate in Title IV programs if more than 50% of its courses are offered by correspondence or if 50% or more of its students are enrolled in correspondence courses. This report first describes the types of institutions eligible to participate in Title IV programs and discusses the program integrity triad. It then discusses additional issues related to institutional eligibility, including program participations agreements, required campus safety policies and crime reporting, and distance and correspondence education."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8147}
{"pred": " The report provides an overview of Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD), its potential impact on the United States, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) approach to responding to an outbreak. FMD is a highly contagious viral disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals, causing fever and painful lesions on their hooves, mouths, and udders. While the disease does not infect humans and is not considered a public health or food safety threat, it can lead to severe productivity losses due to diminished meat and milk production. The United States has not had an FMD outbreak since 1929, but the disease could be introduced from countries in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, or South America where it is present. The U.S. livestock sector is vulnerable to FMD transmission due to the large size and mobility of the sector, with over 94 million cattle, 74 million swine, 5 million sheep, and more than 2 million goats. An FMD outbreak could have serious economic consequences, with the 2001 UK outbreak resulting in the killing of over 6 million animals and direct costs of more than $3 billion to the public sector and over $5 billion to the private sector. The extent of economic damage in the United States would depend primarily on the duration and geographic extent of the outbreak, the extent of trade disruptions, and how consumers reacted to the disease and associated control measures. The United States is vulnerable to FMD transmission, given the large size and mobility of the U.S. livestock sector. In 2018, the United States had about 94 million head of cattle, 74 million swine, 5 million sheep, and more than 2 million goats. Many of these livestock are concentrated in major livestock-producing states such as Texas and Iowa, but livestock are present in every state. According to USDA documents, a large percentage of livestock in the United States are kept on large farms, ranches, or feedlots (i.e., areas or buildings where livestock are fed and fattened up), some with capacity for 50,000 to 100,000 or more animals. Livestock are transported daily to feeding facilities, markets, slaughter plants, and other farms or ranches. For example, swine are often moved among multiple premises at different stages of their life spans to accommodate their growth in size, among other things. According to the swine industry, approximately 1", "answers": ["FMD is a highly contagious viral disease that causes painful lesions on the hooves and mouths of some livestock, making it difficult for them to stand or eat, thus greatly reducing meat and milk production. The United States has not had an FMD outbreak since 1929, but FMD is present in much of the world. An FMD outbreak in the United States could have serious economic impacts, in part because trade partners would likely halt all imports of U.S. livestock and livestock products until the disease was eradicated. These imports were valued at more than $19 billion in 2017. GAO was asked to review USDA's efforts to prepare for an FMD outbreak. This report examines (1) USDA's planned approach for responding to an FMD outbreak; (2) challenges USDA would face in pursuing its response goals; and (3) how USDA identifies, prioritizes, and monitors corrective actions to mitigate the challenges. GAO observed a USDA FMD preparedness exercise; reviewed agency documents and nongeneralizable questionnaire responses from 29 respondents from federal and state government, livestock industries, and universities; and interviewed officials from federal and state governments and representatives of livestock industries and universities. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) planned approach for responding to an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) includes several strategies. These strategies generally rely on killing infected and susceptible animals, vaccinating uninfected animals, or a combination of both approaches. USDA would implement one or more of the strategies, depending on factors such as the outbreak's size and the resources available, according to agency documents. USDA would likely face significant challenges in pursuing its response goals of detecting, controlling, and containing FMD quickly; eradicating FMD while seeking to stabilize industry and the economy; and facilitating continuity of commerce in uninfected animals. GAO identified challenges in 11 areas—including allocating a limited supply of FMD vaccine—based on its review of USDA documents, responses to GAO's questionnaire, and interviews with agency officials and others with expertise on FMD. According to USDA, the agency may not have a sufficient supply of FMD vaccine to control more than a small outbreak because of limited resources to obtain vaccine. As shown below, the current vaccine supply would be sufficient to protect about 14 percent of Texas's cattle or about 4 percent of Iowa's swine; these states' cattle and swine populations are the nation's largest. The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 includes a provision to increase the FMD vaccine supply. USDA has identified dozens of corrective actions to mitigate the challenges of responding to an FMD outbreak, as called for in USDA procedures, but has not prioritized these corrective actions or monitored their completion, as also called for in its procedures. USDA has identified the corrective actions through exercises simulating FMD outbreaks, surveys, and lessons learned from other foreign animal disease outbreaks. However, USDA has not completed all of the corrective actions, including actions related to vaccination. Agency officials stated that they have not completed such corrective actions because they have been responding to outbreaks of other animal diseases and have limited resources. Without following agency procedures to prioritize and monitor corrective actions, USDA cannot ensure that it is allocating its resources to the most beneficial actions to prepare for a possible FMD outbreak. GAO is recommending that USDA follow its procedures to prioritize and monitor the completion of corrective actions that the agency has identified for FMD preparedness. USDA agreed with these recommendations, and described actions it will take to implement them."], "all_classes": null, "length": 11771}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report to understand the main points. The report is about opioid use disorders, medication-assisted treatment (MAT), and the efforts by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to expand access to MAT. \n\nFirst, the report explains that opioids are prescribed for pain and other conditions, but they can be addictive. Over time, tolerance develops, leading to higher doses needed. Misuse of opioids can lead to addiction and death. The report also discusses the three FDA-approved medications for MAT: methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone. Each has different mechanisms and uses. Methadone is a full agonist, used for detox and maintenance. Buprenorphine is a partial agonist, used in various forms. Naltrexone is an antagonist, used for relapse prevention. \n\nThe report then talks about the challenges associated with MAT, such as diversion for illegal use or financial gain. It mentions that certain medications, like methadone and buprenorphine, have potential for misuse. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) regulates the use of these medications, allowing treatment in OTPs or other settings with restrictions. \n\nThere are also mentions of federal grant programs aimed at expanding access to MAT, such as the Targeted Capacity Expansion: Medication Assisted Treatment – Prescription Drug and Opioid Addiction (MAT-PDOA) grant program, the Substance Abuse Service Expansion Supplement to Health Centers, and the Increasing Access to Medication-Assisted Treatment in Rural Primary Care Practices. These programs are funded by different agencies like SAMHSA, HRSA, and AHRQ. \n\nThe report also discusses the importance of diversion control plans, which are required for OTPs and practitioners with higher patient limits. These plans aim to prevent the misuse of medications by implementing measures like monitoring the program environment, controlling dosing and take-home medication, preventing multiple enrollments, and addressing prescription medication misuse. \n\nAdditionally, the report outlines HHS's efforts to evaluate the effectiveness of their MAT expansion programs. However, HHS has not established specific performance measures with targets for the factors related to access to MAT, which makes it difficult to assess progress. The report also mentions that HHS is in the process of finalizing its evaluation approach, which includes timeframes for the activities that will make up the evaluation. \n\nThe summary should highlight the key points: the role of", "answers": ["The misuse of prescription opioid pain relievers and illicit opioids, such as heroin, has contributed to increases in overdose deaths. According to the most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, in 2015 over 52,000 people died of drug overdose deaths, and about 63 percent of them involved an opioid. For those who are addicted to or misuse opioids, MAT has been shown to be an effective treatment. GAO was asked to review HHS and other efforts related to MAT for opioid use disorders. This report (1) describes HHS's key efforts to expand access to MAT, (2) examines HHS's evaluation, if any, of its efforts to expand access to MAT, and (3) describes efforts by selected stakeholders (states, private health insurers, and national associations) to expand access to MAT. GAO gathered information from HHS officials as well as a non-generalizable selection of 15 stakeholders selected based on their MAT expansion activities, among other factors. GAO also assessed HHS's evaluation plans using internal control standards for defining objectives and evaluating results. In an effort to reduce the prevalence of opioid misuse and the fatalities associated with it, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) established a goal to expand access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT). MAT is an approach that combines behavioral therapy and the use of certain medications, such as methadone and buprenorphine. HHS has implemented five key efforts since 2015 that focus on expanding access to MAT for opioid use disorders—four grant programs that focus on expanding access to MAT in various settings (including rural primary care practices and health centers) and regulatory changes that expand treatment capacity by increasing patient limits for buprenorphine prescribers and allowing nurse practitioners and physician assistants to prescribe buprenorphine. Some of the grant awards were made in 2015, while others were made as recently as May 2017. (See figure.) As of August 2017, efforts under all the grant programs were ongoing. Grant recipients can use funding to undertake a range of activities, such as hiring and training providers and supporting treatments involving MAT. In addition, certain providers and grant recipients are required to develop plans for preventing MAT medications from being diverted for nonmedical purposes. HHS officials told GAO that as of August 2017, the department was in the process of finalizing its plans to evaluate its efforts to address the opioid epidemic. In September 2016, HHS awarded a contract to conduct the evaluation. HHS officials told GAO that they are still working with the contractor to finalize the evaluation approach and that it will focus on whether HHS's efforts to address the opioid epidemic have been implemented as intended. HHS officials said that in the future, HHS may also evaluate whether, or to what extent, its efforts have been effective in expanding access to MAT, in addition to evaluating implementation. While HHS has some of the information that could be used in a future evaluation of the effectiveness of its efforts to expand access to MAT, it has not adopted specific performance measures with targets specifying the magnitude of the increases HHS hopes to achieve through its efforts to expand access to MAT, and by when. For example, HHS has not established a long-term target specifying the percentage increase in the number of prescriptions for buprenorphine HHS would like to achieve, which would help to show whether efforts by HHS and others are resulting in a sufficient number of prescriptions for MAT medications. HHS has also not chosen a specific method of measuring treatment capacity or established targets associated with it, which would help determine whether a sufficient number of providers are becoming available to evaluate and treat patients who may benefit from MAT. Without specifying these performance measures and associated targets, HHS will not have an effective means to determine whether its efforts are helping to expand access to MAT or whether new approaches are needed. Gauging this progress is particularly important given the large gap identified nationwide between the total number of individuals who could benefit from MAT and the limited number who can currently access it based on provider availability. In addition, GAO also found that as of August 2017, HHS had not finalized its approach for its planned evaluation activities, including timeframes. Without timeframes for the evaluation's activities, HHS increases the risk that the evaluation will not be completed as expeditiously as possible. In addition to HHS efforts to expand access to MAT, officials from selected states, private health insurers, and national associations reported using several efforts to expand patients' access to MAT for opioid use disorders. For example, several stakeholders provided GAO with the following examples of their efforts: States. State health officials from all five selected states have implemented or are planning approaches that focus on integrating the use of MAT into primary care, such as by providing services for centralized intake and initial management of patients or through telehealth that connects patients in rural areas with addiction specialists in a different location. Private health insurers. Three private health insurers reported removing prior authorization requirements for MAT medications so patients can avoid a waiting period before receiving the medications.

For example, one association developed a road map with strategies that state policymakers can use to address the opioid epidemic, including strategies for reducing the stigma associated with MAT through educating the public and potential providers.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about the Holman rule in the House of Representatives. Let me start by understanding the key points.\n\nThe report explains the separation of policy and funding in Congress. Authorization laws set up programs, while appropriations provide the money. The Holman rule is a House rule that prevents legislative changes in appropriation bills, except for retrenchments (cuts) in funding. The rule has evolved over time, with changes in how retrenchments are defined and allowed. \n\nThe origin of the rule dates back to 1835 when the House wanted to prevent delays in appropriations by excluding non-essential legislative provisions. In 1837, a rule was added stating that appropriations bills shouldn't include expenditures not previously authorized by law. This was later expanded in 1876 to allow retrenchment amendments that reduce expenditures, such as lowering salaries or the number of officers. \n\nOver time, the rule was modified, with the 1880 change narrowing the exception to only reductions in the amounts covered by the bill. This version was later removed and reinserted in different Congresses. In 1983, the rule was amended to narrow the exception to only reductions in the amounts of money covered by the bill. \n\nIn the 115th Congress, a separate order was adopted that reinstated the older language of the rule, allowing retrenchments not only through reductions in the bill's amounts but also through reductions in the number and salary of officers or compensation of people paid from the Treasury. However, this order wasn't adopted for the 116th Congress, reverting to prior precedents. \n\nThe rule's application has been narrowed over time, with precedents requiring that retrenchments result in an obvious reduction of funds. For example, reducing the number of employees or their salaries, or eliminating specific government activities. However, provisions that are too broad or speculative, like terminating employment without guaranteed savings, are not allowed. \n\nThe Holman rule doesn't restrict Congress's lawmaking authority but provides a limited exception. The rule is applied only to funds in the current appropriation bill, not others. Also, the exception doesn't apply to limitations or unaccompanied legislative language. \n\nIn the 115th Congress, some amendments were considered under the new order, like reducing an administrator's salary. However, these amendments were not in order for other appropriation bills. The House Parliamentarian is the authority on these", "answers": ["Although congressional rules establish a general division of responsibility under which questions of policy are kept separate from questions of funding, House rules provide for exceptions in certain circumstances. One such circumstance allows for the inclusion of legislative language in general appropriations bills or amendments thereto for \"germane provisions that retrench expenditures by the reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill.\" This exception appears in clause 2(b) of House Rule XXI and is known as the Holman rule, after Representative William Holman of Indiana, who first proposed the exception in 1876. Since the period immediately after its initial adoption, the House has interpreted the Holman rule through precedents that have tended to incrementally narrow its application. Under current precedents, for a legislative provision or amendment to be in order, the legislative language in question must be both germane to other provisions in the measure and must produce a clear reduction of appropriations in that bill. In addition, the House adopted a separate order during the 115th Congress that provided for retrenchments of expenditures by a reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill to be construed as applying to: any provision or amendment that retrenches expenditures by— (1) the reduction of amounts of money in the bill; (2) the reduction of the number and salary of the officers of the United States; or (3) the reduction of the compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury of the United States.

The report is about runaway and homeless youth in the U.S., their challenges, and the federal programs established to support them.\n\nFirst, the report mentions that running away from home isn't a new phenomenon. It references historical figures like Huckleberry Finn and Davy Crockett who fled abusive fathers. However, today's youth who run away often face more severe consequences, such as being vulnerable to high-risk behaviors, victimization, and being disconnected from school and support systems. The report also highlights the issues of untreated mental health disorders, drug use, and sexual exploitation among these youth.\n\nThen there's a section about the history of federal policies. The Runaway Youth Act of 1974 was a key piece of legislation, later renamed the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act. This act authorized federal funding for three programs: Basic Center Program (BCP), Transitional Living Program (TLP), and Street Outreach Program (SOP). These programs are administered by the Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB) under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Administration for Children and Families (ACF).\n\nThe report details each program's objectives and services. The BCP provides short-term shelter and services for youth and their families, including counseling, family reunification, and aftercare. The TLP offers longer-term support for youth aged 16-22, focusing on life skills, education, job training, and mental health care. The SOP provides outreach and services to youth at risk of sexual exploitation and trafficking. The report also discusses the challenges in defining and counting these youth, as well as the factors influencing homelessness.\n\nThere's a section on the evolution of federal policies, starting with the Runaway Youth Act of 1974 and subsequent updates. The report also covers the current funding levels for the programs, including the Basic Center Program, Transitional Living Program, and Street Outreach Program. It mentions the importance of data collection and the challenges in accurately measuring the homeless youth population.\n\nThe report also discusses the factors contributing to youth homelessness, such as family conflict, mental health issues, and socioeconomic factors. It highlights the vulnerabilities of homeless youth, including exposure to trauma, substance abuse, and sexual exploitation. The report also touches on the role of mental health and substance abuse services in addressing these issues.\n\nIn terms of federal efforts, the report outlines", "answers": ["This report discusses runaway and homeless youth, and the federal response to support this population. There is no single definition of the terms \"runaway youth\" or \"homeless youth.\" However, both groups of youth share the risk of not having adequate shelter and other provisions, and may engage in harmful behaviors while away from a permanent home. Youth most often cite family conflict as the major reason for their homelessness or episodes of running away. A youth's sexual orientation, sexual activity, school problems, and substance abuse are associated with family discord. The precise number of homeless and runaway youth is unknown due to their residential mobility and overlap among the populations. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is supporting data collection efforts, known as Voices of Youth Count, to better determine the number of homeless youth. The 2017 study found that approximately 700,000 youth ages 13 to 17 and 3.5 million young adults ages 18 to 25 experienced homelessness within a 12-month period because they were sleeping in places not meant for habitation, in shelters, or with others while lacking alternative living arrangements. From the early 20th century through the 1960s, the needs of runaway and homeless youth were handled locally through the child welfare agency, juvenile justice courts, or both. The 1970s marked a shift toward federal oversight of programs that help youth who had run afoul of the law, including those who committed status offenses (i.e., a noncriminal act that is considered a violation of the law because of the youth's age). The Runaway Youth Act of 1974 was enacted as Title III of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (P.L. 93-415) to assist runaways through services specifically for this population. The act was amended over time to include homeless youth. It authorizes funding for services carried out under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program (RHYP), which is administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The program was most recently authorized through FY2020 by the Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-385). This law did not make other changes to the RHYP statute. Funding is discretionary, meaning provided through the appropriations process. FY2019 appropriations are $127.4 million. The RHYP program is made up of three components: the Basic Center Program (BCP), Transitional Living Program (TLP), and Street Outreach Program (SOP). The BCP provides temporary shelter, counseling, and after care services to runaway and homeless youth under age 18 and their families. In FY2017, the program served 23,288 youth, and in FY2018 it funded 280 BCP shelters (most recent figures available). The TLP is targeted to older youth ages 16 through 22 (and sometimes an older age). In FY2017, the TLP program served 3,517 youth, and in FY2018 it funded 299 grantees (most recent figures available). Youth who use the TLP receive longer-term housing with supportive services. The SOP provides education, treatment, counseling, and referrals for runaway, homeless, and street youth who have been subjected to, or are at risk of being subjected to, sexual abuse, sex exploitation, and trafficking. In FY2017, the SOP grantees made contact with 24,366 youth. The RHYP is a part of larger federal efforts to end youth homelessness through the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH). The USICH is a coordinating body made up of multiple federal agencies committed to addressing homelessness. The USICH's Opening Doors plan to end homelessness includes strategies for ending youth homelessness by 2020, including through collecting better data and supporting evidence-based practices to improve youth outcomes. Voices of Youth Count is continuing to report on characteristics of homeless youth. In addition to the RHYP, there are other federal supports to address youth homelessness. HUD's Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program is funding a range of housing options for youth, in selected urban and rural communities. Other federal programs have enabled homeless youth to access services, including those related to education and family violence."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8238}

They are funded through the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) appropriations. The report compares the FY2019 request with FY2018 funding, noting that the FY2018 figures are based on the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, which provided specific amounts for each agency. The total for FY2018 was $648.3 million. Then, the FY2019 appropriations were $647.0 million, a 0.2% decrease from FY2018. \n\nThe President submitted the FY2019 budget request on February 12, 2018, which included a total of $590.8 million for the three agencies. This was an 8.9% decrease from the FY2018 appropriation. The request included reduced funding for all three agencies: ITA had a 8.7% decrease, USITC a 6.5% decrease, and USTR a 13.2% decrease. However, the Administration proposed increasing some trade enforcement activities within ITA and USTR. For ITA, they wanted to increase enforcement while reducing export promotion. For USTR, they requested funds to increase staffing, but not from the Trade Enforcement Trust Fund. The President's budget didn't explain the decrease in USITC funding. \n\nThe House and Senate Appropriations Committees reported their CJS appropriation bills in the spring of 2018. Both committees largely declined the budget cuts requested by the Administration.

The Administration's Request On February 12, 2018, the Trump Administration submitted its FY2019 budget request to Congress. The FY2019 proposal included a total of $590.8 million for the three CJS trade-related agencies, an 8.9% decrease from FY2018 total appropriated amounts for these agencies. The Administration requested reducing funding for all three trade-related agencies.

Congressional Actions In the spring of 2018, the House and Senate reported FY2019 CJS appropriations bills, which included proposed funding for ITA, USITC, and USTR. The reported bills did not adopt many of the Administration's budget reductions, and instead proposed funding levels that were more similar to the FY2018-enacted amounts. The House Committee on Appropriations reported H.R. 5952 on May 17, 2018. The House proposal recommended a total of $647.6 million for the three CJS trade-related agencies. This proposal was $56.8 million more (9.6%) than the Administration's request, and $0.7 million less (-0.1%) than the FY2018-enacted legislation.

The report is about the long-term fiscal outlook for state and local governments in the U.S. It mentions that revenues are projected to be insufficient to cover expenditures over the next 50 years, leading to a fiscal gap. The operating balance, which is the difference between current revenues and expenditures, is expected to remain negative. \n\nThe report explains that while both revenues and expenditures are increasing as a percentage of GDP, expenditures are growing faster. This is due to factors like health care costs, which are a significant part of the budget. Medicaid spending is expected to rise, driven by both population growth and increased per capita costs. Also, health benefits for employees and retirees are projected to grow, contributing to the fiscal gap.\n\nThe report mentions that without policy changes, the sector will face a persistent fiscal imbalance. It suggests that state and local governments need to make changes to either increase revenues, reduce expenditures, or a combination of both. The fiscal gap is estimated at 14.7 percent of total expenditures or 2.4 percent of GDP. This means that to close the gap, the sector would need to reduce expenditures by that amount or increase revenues similarly.\n\nHealth care expenditures, particularly Medicaid and employee/retiree benefits, are a major driver of the growing fiscal gap. Medicaid spending is projected to grow faster than GDP, with an average of 1 percentage point more than GDP each year. This is due to both increased enrollment and higher per capita costs. The report also notes that national health expenditures per capita are expected to grow about 0.8 percentage points faster than GDP. \n\nOther factors include pension obligations. The report states that pension contributions are expected to rise, but the exact percentage depends on various assumptions. If the rate of return on pension assets is higher, the required contributions would be lower. Conversely, a lower rate of return would necessitate higher contributions. \n\nThe report also discusses the impact of federal policies, such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), on state and local government revenues. The TCJA's changes to tax laws, including the cap on state and local tax deductions, could affect the revenue streams. Additionally, the Supreme Court's ruling in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. allows states to collect sales taxes from out-of-state sellers, which could increase state revenues.\n\nThe report highlights that without changes, the fiscal gap", "answers": ["Fiscal sustainability presents a national challenge shared by all levels of government. Since 2007, GAO has published simulations of long-term fiscal trends in the state and local government sector, which have consistently shown that the sector faces long-term fiscal pressures. While most states have requirements related to balancing their budgets, deficits can arise because the planned annual revenues are not generated at the expected rate, demand for services exceeds planned expenditures, or both, resulting in a near-term operating deficit. This report updates GAO's state and local fiscal model to simulate the fiscal outlook for the state and local government sector. This includes identifying the components of state and local expenditures likely to contribute to the sector's fiscal pressures. In addition, this report identifies considerations related to federal policy and other factors that could contribute to uncertainties in the state and local government sector's long-term fiscal outlook. GAO's model uses the Bureau of Economic Analysis's National Income and Product Accounts as the primary data source and presents the results in the aggregate for the state and local sector as a whole. The model shows the level of receipts and expenditures for the sector until 2067, based on current and historical spending and revenue patterns. In addition, the model assumes that the current set of policies in place across state and local government remains constant to show a simulated long-term outlook. GAO's simulations suggest that the state and local government sector will likely face an increasing difference between revenues and expenditures during the next 50 years as reflected by the operating balance--a measure of the sector's ability to cover its current expenditures out of its current receipts. While both expenditures and revenues are projected to increase as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), a difference between the two is projected to persist because expenditures are expected to grow faster than revenues throughout the simulation period. GAO's simulations also suggest that growth in the sector's overall spending is largely driven by health care expenditures--in particular, Medicaid spending and spending on health benefits for state and local government employees and retirees. These expenditures are projected to grow as a share of GDP during the simulation period. GAO's simulations also suggest that revenues from personal income taxes and federal grants to states and localities will increase during the simulation period. However, revenues will grow more slowly than expenditures such that the sector faces a declining fiscal outlook. GAO also identified federal policy changes that could affect the state and local government sector's fiscal outlook. For example, the effects of the recently-enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will likely depend on how states incorporate the Act into their state income tax rules. In addition, other factors, such as economic growth and rates of return on pension assets, could shift future fiscal outcomes for the sector."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8477}

Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points.\n\nThe report begins by explaining the legal requirement under U.S. Code, Title 10, Section 5063, for the Marine Corps to have amphibious and land operations capabilities. This led to the development of the ACV and MPC. The EFV program was canceled in 2011 due to cost overruns and poor performance, prompting the need for a more affordable replacement. The ACV was intended to replace the AAV, which is outdated and has several shortcomings. The MPC was developed to transport Marines inland, with a focus on swim capability for water obstacles. However, the MPC program was put on hold in 2013 due to budgetary pressures, leading to questions about its necessity. The Marines later decided to resurrect the MPC as ACV Increment 1.1, which would have a swim capability but require a connector to get from ship to shore. The program faced challenges in developing an affordable high water speed capability, leading to delays. The Marines eventually selected BAE Systems to produce the ACV, with the program on track to meet cost goals. The report also discusses the strategic vision for amphibious operations, including the Expeditionary Advance Base Operations (EABO) concept, which could impact the ACV program's requirements and timelines. There are questions about the cost-effectiveness of the ACV program, the need for the MPC, and how EABO might influence the program's future. The summary needs to be concise, covering the main points: the legal basis, the EFV cancellation, the ACV and MPC development, budget issues, the EABO concept, and the current status of the ACV program. I should structure the summary to first outline the legal requirements and the need for amphibious capabilities. Then discuss the EFV cancellation and the shift to ACV and MPC. Mention the budgetary challenges and the MPC's suspension. Then talk about the EABO concept and its potential impact on the ACV program. Finally, note the current status of the ACV program, including the selection of BAE Systems and the timeline for production.

Because the EFV was intended to replace the 40-year-old Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAV), the Pentagon pledged to move quickly to develop a \"more affordable and sustainable\" vehicle to replace the EFV. The Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) is intended to replace the AAV, incorporating some EFV capabilities but in a more practical and cost-efficient manner. In concert with the ACV, the Marines were developing the Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC) to serve as a survivable and mobile platform to transport Marines when ashore. The MPC was not intended to be amphibious like an AAV, EFV, or the ACV but instead would be required to have a swim capability for inland waterways such as rivers, lakes, and other water obstacles such as shore-to-shore operations in the littorals. Both vehicles were intended to play central roles in future Marine amphibious operations. On June 14, 2013, Marine leadership put the MPC program \"on ice\" due to budgetary pressures but suggested the program might be resurrected some 10 years down the road when budgetary resources might be more favorable. In what was described as a \"drastic shift,\" the Marines decided to \"resurrect\" the MPC in March 2014. The Marines designated the MPC as ACV Increment 1.1 and planned to acquire about 200 vehicles. The Marines also plan to develop ACV Increment 1.2, a tracked, fully amphibious version, and at the time planned to acquire about 470 vehicles and fund an ongoing high water speed study. Although ACV Increment 1.1 is to have a swim capability, another mode of transport (ship or aircraft) would be required to get the vehicles from ship to shore. The Marines are reportedly exploring the possibility of developing a high water speed ACV 2.0, which could accompany tanks and light armored vehicles into combat. On November 5, 2014, the Marines released a draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for ACV Increment 1.1. On November 24, 2015, the Marine Corps awarded BAE Systems and SAIC contracts to develop ACV 1.1 prototypes for evaluation. BAE's contract was for $103.8 million and SAIC's for $121.5 million, and each company was to build 16 prototypes to be tested over the next two years. Both BAE and SAIC delivered their prototypes early, and Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) testing began mid-March 2017. In early December 2017, the Marines reportedly sent the ACV 1.1 down select request for proposals to BAE and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). On June 19, 2018, the Marine Corps selected BAE Systems to produce the ACV. The initial contract—valued at $198 million—was for low-rate production of 30 vehicles to be delivered by the autumn of 2019. On April 10, 2019, during testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Navy and Marine Corps leadership announced that during the fall of 2018, ACV 1.1 prototypes demonstrated satisfactory water mobility performance in high surf conditions and, in doing so, met the full water mobility transition requirement for ACV 1.2 capability. As a result, ACV 1.1 and ACV 1.2 were to be consolidated into a single variant—the ACV—which is intended to replace all AAVs.

Israeli domestic political issues, including elections scheduled for 2019. Israel relies on a number of strengths to manage potential threats to its security and existence. It maintains conventional military superiority relative to neighboring states and the Palestinians. It also takes measures to deter attack and defend its population and borders from evolving asymmetric threats such as rockets and missiles, cross-border tunneling, drones, and cyberattacks. Additionally, Israel has an undeclared but presumed nuclear weapons capability. Against a backdrop of strong bilateral cooperation, Israel's leaders and supporters routinely make the case that Israel's security and the broader stability of the region remain critically important for U.S. interests. A 10-year bilateral military aid memorandum of understanding (MOU)—signed in 2016—commits the United States to provide Israel $3.3 billion in Foreign Military Financing annually from FY2019 to FY2028, along with additional amounts from Defense Department accounts for missile defense. All of these amounts remain subject to congressional appropriations. Israeli officials seek to counter Iranian regional influence and prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu released new Israeli intelligence on Iran's nuclear program in April 2018, days before President Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 international agreement that constrains Iran's nuclear activities. It is unclear whether Israel might take future military action in Iran if Iranian nuclear activities resume. Since 2018, Israel has conducted a number of military operations in Syria against Iran and its allies, including Lebanese Hezbollah. Israel and Iran also appear to be competing for military advantage over each other at the Israel-Lebanon border. Amid uncertainty in the area, in March 2019 President Trump recognized Israel's claim to sovereignty over the Golan Heights, changing long-standing U.S. policy that held—in line with U.N. Security Council Resolution 497 from 1981—the Golan was occupied Syrian territory whose final status was subject to Israel-Syria negotiation. The prospects for an Israeli-Palestinian peace process are complicated by many factors. Palestinian leaders cut off high-level political contacts with the Trump Administration after it recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December 2017. U.S.-Palestinian tensions have since worsened amid U.S. cutoffs of funding to the Palestinians and diplomatic moves—including the May 2018 opening of the U.S. embassy to Israel in Jerusalem. Palestinian leaders interpreted these actions as prejudicing their claims to a capital in Jerusalem and to a just resolution of Palestinian refugee claims. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has welcomed these U.S. actions. The Trump Administration has suggested that it will release a proposed peace plan after Israeli elections, which are scheduled for April 9, 2019.

{"pred": " The Department of Defense (DOD) has implemented revised foreign currency budget rates to better align with market rates, which in turn affects its projected Operation and Maintenance (O&M) and Military Personnel (MILPERS) funding needs. These revisions are based on the DOD's analysis of foreign currency exchange rates, which are subject to market volatility. The DOD has used various methodologies for establishing these rates, including a centered weighted average model that combined both a 5-year average of exchange rates and an average of the most recently observed 12 months of exchange rates. In fiscal year 2017, the DOD adjusted its methodology to establish the foreign currency budget rates by calculating a 6-month average of Wall Street Journal rates published every Monday from May 25, 2015, to November 16, 2015. This approach was chosen to more closely represent the foreign currency exchange rates experienced by the department during budget formulation, and it accounted for the strength of the U.S. Dollar, which had increased as compared with its historical 5-year average. DOD’s analysis found that the use of the 5-year historical average would have resulted in substantial gains when compared with gains expected from application of the 6-month average. More specifically, DOD projected gains of about $1 billion using the 5-year average of rates. The DOD uses the Foreign Currency Fluctuations, Defense (FCFD) account to cover losses due to foreign currency fluctuations. The FCFD account is a no-year account, meaning that it is available until expended, while O&M and MILPERS appropriations are 1-year amounts and expire at the end of the fiscal year for which they were appropriated. Expired O&M and MILPERS amounts remain available only for limited purposes for 5 additional fiscal years. At the end of the 5-year expired period, any remaining O&M or MILPERS amounts, obligated or unobligated, are canceled and returned to Treasury. The DOD has also used the FCFD account to cover losses that the services experienced due to foreign currency fluctuations in 6 of the 8 years we reviewed. However, DOD does not effectively manage the FCFD account balance based on projected gains or losses. Transfers of expired unobligated balances from MILPERS and O&M accounts into the FCFD account have been made to replenish the account balance to the statutory limit of $970 million, without considering the projected losses", "answers": ["DOD requested about $60 billion for fiscal years 2009 - 2017 to purchase goods and services overseas and reimburse service-members for costs incurred while stationed abroad. DOD uses foreign currency exchange rates to budget and pay (that is, disburse amounts) for these expenses. It also manages the FCFD account to mitigate a loss in buying power that results from foreign currency rate changes. GAO was asked to examine DOD's processes to budget for and manage foreign currency fluctuations. This report (1) describes DOD's revision of its foreign currency budget rates since 2009 and the relationship between the revised rates and projected O&M and MILPERS funding needs; (2) evaluates the extent to which DOD has taken steps to reduce costs in selecting foreign currency rates to disburse funds to liquidate O&M obligations, and determined whether opportunities exist to gain additional savings; and (3) assesses the extent to which DOD has effectively managed the FCFD account balance. GAO analyzed data on foreign currency rates, DOD financial management regulations, a non-generalizable sample of foreign currency disbursement data, and FCFD account balances. The Department of Defense (DOD) revised its foreign currency exchange rates (“budget rates”) during fiscal years 2014 through 2016 for each of the nine foreign currencies it uses to develop its Operation and Maintenance (O&M) and Military Personnel (MILPERS) budget request. These revisions decreased DOD's projected O&M and MILPERS funding needs. DOD's revision of the budget rates during these years also decreased the expected gains (that is, buying power) that would have resulted from an increase in the strength of the U.S. Dollar relative to other foreign currencies. DOD did not revise its budget rates in fiscal years 2009 through 2013. For fiscal year 2017, DOD changed its methodology for producing budget rates, resulting in rates that were more closely aligned with market rates. According to officials, that change made it unnecessary to revise the budget rates during the fiscal year. DOD has taken some steps to reduce costs in selecting foreign currency rates used to pay (that is, disburse amounts) for goods and services, but DOD has not fully determined whether opportunities exist to achieve additional savings. The Army has estimated potential savings of up to $10 million annually by using a foreign currency rate available 3 days in advance of paying for goods or services rather than a more costly rate available up to 5 days in advance. The Army has converted to the use of a 3-day advanced rate. GAO's analysis suggests that DOD could achieve cost savings if the services reviewed and consistently selected the most cost-effective foreign currency rates when paying for their goods and services. Absent a review, DOD is at risk for paying more than it would otherwise be required to conduct its transactions. DOD used the Foreign Currency Fluctuations, Defense (FCFD) account to cover losses (that is, less buying power) due to unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations in 6 of the 8 years GAO reviewed. Since 2012, DOD has maintained the FCFD account balance at the statutory limit of $970 million, largely by transferring unobligated balances before they are cancelled from certain DOD accounts into the FCFD. However, DOD has not identified the appropriate FCFD account balance needed to maintain program operations by routinely analyzing projected losses and basing any transfers into the account on those expected losses. Thus, DOD may be maintaining balances that are hundreds of millions of dollars higher than needed, and that could have been used for other purposes or returned to the Treasury Department (see figure). GAO is making four recommendations, including that DOD review opportunities to achieve cost savings by more consistently selecting the most cost-effective foreign currency rates used for the payment of goods and services, and analyze projected losses to manage the FCFD account balance.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report about the DHS CFATS program. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points.\n\nThe report discusses various areas where DHS has made progress and faced challenges in managing the CFATS program. The main areas are identifying high-risk facilities, assessing risk and prioritizing, reviewing security plans, conducting compliance inspections, and stakeholder outreach. \n\nFirst, the report mentions that in May 2014, DHS found over 1,300 facilities had reported ammonium nitrate, but there were more facilities with it than reported. So, some facilities didn't report. The recommendation was to improve data sharing with agencies and states. DHS agreed and worked with EPA and other states to find non-compliant facilities. They identified 1,000 more facilities and contacted them. As of June 2018, they had 43 lists from 34 states, and a new lead was hired. They also improved data accuracy by updating the Top-Screen in 2016 to calculate Distance of Concern themselves, which helped identify 158 facilities that needed correction. \n\nThen there's the risk assessment part. The original approach didn't consider all elements of threat, vulnerability, and consequence, especially economic consequences. They recommended enhancing the approach and conducting peer reviews. DHS worked with Sandia and Oak Ridge to develop new models and tiering methodologies. They also revised the CSAT tool to make it more efficient. \n\nRegarding compliance inspections, the report found that nearly half of the facilities weren't compliant, and DHS didn't issue penalties but worked with them. They recommended documenting compliance procedures, which DHS started with updated SOPs. \n\nFor stakeholder outreach, DHS increased facility visits but didn't have systematic feedback. They recommended soliciting feedback, which they did with a questionnaire starting in 2016. \n\nThe report also mentions that DHS has made programmatic changes, like the Expedited Approval Program (EAP), which allows some facilities to use prescriptive security measures. However, participation has been low, with only 18 out of 3,152 eligible facilities using it. Reasons include that most had already submitted standard plans, the EAP measures being too strict, and lack of authorization inspections. \n\nDHS has also worked on reducing the backlog of security plan reviews, implementing an Expedited Approval Program, and updating their enforcement procedures. They've made progress in these areas,", "answers": ["Thousands of facilities have hazardous chemicals that could be targeted or used to inflict mass casualties or harm surrounding populations in the United States. In accordance with the DHS Appropriations Act, 2007, DHS established the CFATS program in 2007 to, among other things, identify and assess the security risk posed by chemical facilities. DHS inspects high-risk facilities after it approves facility security plans to ensure that the facilities are implementing required security measures and procedures. This statement summarizes progress and challenges related to DHS's CFATS program management. This statement is based on prior products GAO issued from July 2012 through June 2017, along with updates conducted in June 2018 on DHS actions to address prior GAO recommendations. To conduct the prior work, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and DHS policies for administering the CFATS program, how DHS assesses risk, and data on high-risk chemical facilities. GAO also interviewed DHS officials and reviewed information on DHS actions to implement its prior recommendations. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has made progress addressing challenges that GAO's past work identified to managing the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program. The following summarizes progress made and challenges remaining in key aspects of the program. Identifying high-risk chemical facilities. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS used self-reported and unverified data to determine the risk of facilities holding toxic chemicals that could threaten surrounding communities if released. GAO recommended that DHS should better verify the accuracy of facility-reported data. DHS implemented this recommendation by revising its methodology so it now calculates the risk of toxic release, rather than relying on facilities to do so. Assessing risk and prioritizing facilities. In April 2013, GAO reported weaknesses in multiple aspects of DHS's risk assessment and prioritization approach. GAO made two recommendations for DHS to review and improve this process, including that DHS enhance its risk assessment approach to incorporate all of the elements of consequence, threat, and vulnerability associated with a terrorist attack involving certain chemicals. DHS launched a new risk assessment methodology in October 2016 and is currently gathering new or updated data from about 27,000 facilities to (1) determine which facilities should be categorized as high-risk because of the threat of sabotage, theft or diversion, or a toxic release and (2) assign those facilities deemed high risk to one of four risk-based tiers. GAO has ongoing work assessing these efforts and will report later this summer on the extent to which they fully address prior recommendations. Reviewing and approving facilities' site security plans . DHS is to review security plans and visit facilities to ensure their security measures meet DHS standards. In April 2013, GAO reported a 7 to 9 year backlog for these reviews and visits. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS had made substantial progress in addressing the backlog—estimating that it could take between 9 and 12 months for DHS to review and approve security plans for the approximately 900 remaining facilities. DHS has since taken additional action to expedite these activities and has eliminated this backlog. Inspecting facilities and ensuring compliance. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS conducted compliance inspections at 83 of the 1,727 facilities with approved security plans. GAO found that nearly half of the inspected facilities were not fully compliant with their approved security plans and that DHS did not have documented procedures for managing facilities' compliance. GAO recommended that DHS document procedures for managing compliance. As a result, DHS has developed an enforcement procedure and a draft compliance inspection procedure and expects to finalize the compliance inspection procedure by the end of fiscal year 2018. GAO has made various recommendations to strengthen DHS's management of the CFATS program, with which DHS has generally agreed. DHS has implemented or described planned actions to address most of these recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2363}
{"pred": " The report provides an overview of coal production, mining practices, and the regulatory framework governing coal mining in the United States, with a focus on the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) and its implementation by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE). In 2016, coal accounted for 17 percent of energy production and 30 percent of electricity production in the U.S., with approximately 730 million tons of coal mined domestically. About 40 percent of this coal was produced on federal lands. The report details the two primary methods of coal mining: surface mining and underground mining. Surface mining involves clearing vegetation, removing topsoil, and using explosives to break up overlying rock, resulting in spoil. Underground mining involves digging tunnels to access deeper coal, with varying impacts on the overlying surface. The report highlights the environmental impacts of coal mining, including water pollution, acid mine drainage, and changes in water tables. It also discusses the regulatory requirements under SMCRA, including the need for financial assurances to ensure reclamation of mined areas. Financial assurances can be in the form of surety bonds, collateral bonds, or self-bonds, with self-bonds available only to operators with a history of financial solvency and continuous operation. The report notes that as of 2017, approximately $10.2 billion in financial assurances were held by OSMRE and states for coal mine reclamation, with surety bonds comprising the majority. The report also discusses the challenges and risks associated with financial assurances, including the potential for self-bonded operators to default, the financial instability of surety companies, and the difficulty in assessing the adequacy of financial assurances for long-term reclamation costs. The report highlights the importance of periodic reviews of financial assurance amounts to ensure they remain sufficient as conditions change. It also discusses the challenges faced by OSMRE and state regulatory authorities in managing self-bonding, including the complexity of financial structures, the difficulty in determining operator eligibility, and the risk of financial instability. The report further notes that the financial risk associated with self-bonding has increased significantly since the practice was first authorized under SMCRA, particularly following the bankruptcies of three major U.S. coal companies in 2015 and 2016. These events have highlighted the risks that OSMRE and state regulatory authorities face in managing self-bonding, which may be greater than when the practice was first authorized under", "answers": ["Coal accounts for 17 percent of domestic energy production. SMCRA requires coal mine operators to reclaim lands that were disturbed during mining and to submit a financial assurance in an amount sufficient to ensure that adequate funds will be available to complete reclamation if the operator does not do so. Recent coal company bankruptcies have drawn attention to whether financial assurances obtained by OSMRE and state agencies will be adequate to reclaim land once coal mining operations have ceased. GAO was asked to review management of financial assurances for coal mine reclamation. This report describes, among other things, the amounts and types of financial assurances held for coal mine reclamation in 2017 and the challenges that OSMRE and state agencies face in managing these financial assurances. GAO collected and analyzed data from OSMRE and 23 state agencies; reviewed federal laws, regulations, and directives; and interviewed OSMRE and state agency officials and representatives from organizations associated with the mining and financial assurance industries and environmental organizations. State agencies and the Department of the Interior's Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) reported holding approximately $10.2 billion in surety bonds (guaranteed by a third party), collateral bonds (guaranteed by a tangible asset, such as a certificate of deposit), and self-bonds (guaranteed on the basis of a coal operator's own finances) as financial assurances for coal mine reclamation. OSMRE and state agencies face several challenges in managing financial assurances, according to the stakeholders GAO interviewed. Specifically, Obtaining additional financial assurances from operators for unanticipated reclamation costs, such as long-term treatment for water pollution, can be difficult. Determining the financial stability of surety companies has been challenging in certain instances. Self-bonding presents a risk to the government because it is difficult to (1) ascertain the financial health of an operator, (2) determine whether the operator qualifies for self-bonding, and (3) obtain a replacement for existing self-bonds when an operator no longer qualifies. In addition, some stakeholders said that the risk from self-bonding is greater now than when the practice was first authorized under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA). GAO's previous work examining environmental cleanup found that the financial risk to government and the amount of oversight needed for self-bonds are relatively high compared to other forms of financial assurances. GAO also previously reviewed federal financial assurance requirements for various energy and mineral extraction sectors and found that coal mining is the only one where self-bonding was allowed. However, because SMCRA explicitly allows states to decide whether to accept self-bonds, eliminating the risk that self-bonds pose to the federal government and states would require SMCRA be amended. GAO recommends that Congress consider amending SMCRA to eliminate self-bonding. Interior neither agreed nor disagreed with GAO's recommendation."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6217}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report talks about how federal agencies are funded annually through regular appropriations acts. If those acts are delayed, a continuing resolution (CR) is used as an interim funding source. The fiscal year started on October 1 in 1977, and there were only four instances where regular appropriations acts were enacted by the start of the fiscal year. However, CRs weren't needed in one of those years. The report mentions the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits spending without appropriations. When there's a funding gap (a period without appropriations), agencies can't make contracts or obligate funds unless authorized by law. \n\nIn 1980 and 1981, the Attorney General issued letters (Civiletti letters) that clarified the limits of federal activities during funding gaps. These letters stated that agencies can't make contracts or obligate funds unless authorized by law. Also, they can't employ non-excepted personnel during a funding gap, except for certain legal obligations related to orderly termination. \n\nThe Civiletti letters led to government shutdowns when funding gaps occurred. However, not all funding gaps resulted in shutdowns, especially if the gap was short or if funding was expected to be restored soon. The report also mentions that agencies often retroactively pay furloughed employees. \n\nThere have been 20 funding gaps since FY1977. Some of these were \"next-day\" CRs, which don't count as gaps because there was no full day without funding. The majority of gaps occurred between FY1977 and FY1995. Some years had multiple gaps. For example, FY1978 had three gaps totaling 28 days. \n\nThe report also discusses the impact of these funding gaps. Before the Civiletti letters, agencies didn't shut down during gaps. However, after the letters, shutdowns became more common. The report gives examples of funding gaps leading to furloughs and shutdowns, like the 1996 and 2019 gaps. \n\nThe report mentions that proposals for an automatic continuing resolution (ACR) have been considered but not enacted. The ACR would provide funding automatically if appropriations are delayed. \n\nThe summary should include the key points: funding through regular appropriations and CRs, the Antideficiency", "answers": ["The Antideficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341-1342, 1511-1519) generally bars the obligation of funds in the absence of appropriations. Exceptions are made under the act, including for activities involving \"the safety of human life or the protection of property.\" The interval during the fiscal year when appropriations for a particular project or activity are not enacted into law, either in the form of a regular appropriations act or a continuing resolution (CR), is referred to as a funding gap or funding lapse. Although funding gaps may occur at the start of the fiscal year, they may also occur any time a CR expires and another CR (or the regular appropriations bill) is not enacted immediately thereafter. Multiple funding gaps may occur within a fiscal year. When a funding gap occurs, federal agencies are generally required to begin a shutdown of the affected projects and activities, which includes the prompt furlough of non-excepted personnel. The general practice of the federal government after the shutdown has ended has been to retroactively pay furloughed employees for the time they missed, as well as employees who were required to come to work. Although a shutdown may be the result of a funding gap, the two events should be distinguished. This is because a funding gap may result in a total shutdown of all affected projects or activities in some instances but not others. For example, when funding gaps are of a short duration, agencies may not have enough time to complete a shutdown of affected projects and activities before funding is restored. In addition, the Office of Management and Budget has previously indicated that a shutdown of agency operations within the first day of the funding gap may be postponed if a resolution appears to be imminent. Since FY1977, 20 funding gaps occurred, ranging in duration from 1 day to 34 full days. These funding gaps are listed in Table 1. About half of these funding gaps were brief (i.e., three days or less in duration). Notably, many of the funding gaps do not appear to have resulted in a \"shutdown.\" Prior to the issuance of the opinions in 1980 and early 1981 by then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti, while agencies tended to curtail some operations in response to a funding gap, they often \"continued to operate during periods of expired funding.\" In addition, some of the funding gaps after the Civiletti opinions did not result in a completion of shutdown operations due to both the funding gap's short duration and an expectation that appropriations would soon be enacted. Some of the funding gaps during this period, however, did have a broader impact on affected government operations, even if only for a matter of hours. Two funding gaps occurred in FY1996, amounting to 5 days and 21 days. The chronology of regular and continuing appropriations enacted during FY1996 is illustrated in Figure 1. At the beginning of FY2014 (October 1, 2013), none of the regular appropriations bills had been enacted, so a government-wide funding gap occurred. It concluded on October 17, 2013, after lasting 16 full days. During FY2018, there was a funding gap when a CR covering all of the regular appropriations bills expired on January 19, 2018. It concluded on January 22, 2018, after lasting two full days. The most recent funding gap occurred during FY2019, when a CR covering federal agencies and activities funded in 7 of the 12 regular appropriations bills expired on December 21, 2018. It concluded on January 25, 2019, after lasting 34 full days.

The report outlines the current structure of DOD document services, highlighting the role of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) as the single manager for printing and high-volume duplication, as well as its preferred provider for document conversion and automation services. DLA Document Services operates a network of 132 production facilities worldwide, with the majority located in the continental United States. The report also discusses the ongoing efforts to reduce the number of print devices and the transition to digital, online services, as part of a transformation plan to consolidate DLA's physical infrastructure. The plan includes closing or consolidating 74 of DLA's 112 U.S. facilities, reducing the workforce from about 600 to 400, and increasing the use of electronic content management systems. However, the report identifies four areas where further gains in efficiency may be possible: managing fragmentation in printing and reproduction services, reducing overlap in procuring print devices, meeting goals to reduce the number of print devices, and consolidating locations that provide mission specialty printing. The report also highlights the need for DOD to improve the accuracy of its financial reporting on document services, as current budget materials include non-printing activities and omit information on device procurement and electronic content management. The report concludes with six recommendations to DOD, including assessing the effectiveness of DLA Document Services as a single manager for printing and reproduction, evaluating the best value in obtaining print devices, implementing controls to monitor print device reductions, and improving the accuracy of financial reporting on document services. The report was reviewed by DOD and they concurred with five of the recommendations and partially concurred with the sixth. The findings suggest that while DOD has made progress in reducing costs and improving efficiency in its document services, there are still opportunities for further improvements, particularly in managing fragmentation and consolidating mission specialty locations.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report about the Department of Defense's document services. Let me start by understanding the key points from the report.\n\nFirst, the report categorizes DOD document services into three main areas: printing and reproduction, device procurement, and electronic content management. Printing and reproduction includes both in-house operations by DOD components and services like DLA Document Services, GPO, or commercial vendors. Device procurement covers office-level equipment (printers, copiers, MFDs)", "answers": ["DOD has reported printing costs that totaled about $608 million, on average, during fiscal years 2010 through 2015. DLA Document Services has key DOD-wide responsibilities for (1) printing and reproduction, (2) print device procurement, and (3) electronic content management (e.g., digital document repositories). Other DOD components, including the military services, also maintain some document services capabilities at various locations. House Report 115-200 accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018 included a provision for GAO to examine DOD's document services. This report evaluates (1) the progress DOD has made in achieving efficiencies in its document services and opportunities, if any, to achieve further efficiencies, and (2) the extent to which DOD reports accurate financial information about its document services to key stakeholders. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials regarding DOD's efficiency initiatives, including DLA Document Services' transformation plan; reviewed print device procurement contracts and pricing information; and analyzed DOD budget data for fiscal years 2012 through 2016. The Department of Defense (DOD) has taken steps to achieve efficiencies in its document services, including implementing a transformation plan to consolidate existing Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Document Services facilities. However, GAO identified four areas where further gains may be possible: Managing fragmentation in printing and reproduction services. DOD has designated DLA Document Services as the single manager for printing and reproduction services, but DOD customers, citing concerns with DLA's services, have also obtained these services directly from the Government Publishing Office and via in-house print facilities (see fig.). DOD has not assessed DLA's performance in this role or whether additional efficiencies may be possible in light of DLA's transformation plan. Reducing overlap in procuring print devices. GAO found that DOD components used at least four different contract sources to acquire print devices. DOD has not assessed which acquisition approach represents the best value; doing so might better position DOD to further reduce its costs. Meeting goals to reduce the number of print devices. DOD and the military services have not demonstrated that they achieved established goals for reducing the number of print devices. Additional controls and assignment of oversight responsibilities to monitor progress could better enable DOD to achieve its cost savings goals, estimated to be millions of dollars annually. Consolidating DLA facilities. DLA is closing or consolidating 74 of its 112 facilities in the United States. However, GAO found that for four of seven types of specialty services, DLA plans to retain facilities that are responsible for less than 5 percent of the total revenue for each of those specialties, which suggests that further consolidations are possible. DOD includes the cost of non-printing activities, such as the purchase of advertising time for recruiting, within its budget materials for printing and reproduction. It does not include costs to acquire print devices and for electronic content management. As a result, DOD and the Congress lack the oversight into total document services costs needed to make informed decisions. GAO is making six recommendations, including that DOD evaluate options to achieve additional cost savings and other efficiencies in its document services and report more accurate budget data.

{"pred": " The federal government owns and leases hundreds of thousands of buildings, costing billions annually to operate and maintain. To address inefficiencies, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the General Services Administration (GSA) have led initiatives to improve real property management. In 2012, OMB introduced a policy to freeze the federal government's real property footprint, which was later modified in 2013 to set a maximum square footage for domestic office and warehouse space. In 2015, OMB transitioned to a strategy of reducing the federal real property footprint, emphasizing three key steps: (1) freezing growth in the inventory; (2) measuring performance and using data to identify efficiency opportunities; and (3) reducing the inventory by consolidating, co-locating, and disposing of properties. The Real Property Efficiency (RTF) policy requires agencies to submit annual Real Property Efficiency Plans to GSA and OMB, set design standards for maximum useable square feet per workstation, and establish annual reduction targets for a 5-year period. Agencies must also identify potential projects related to office and warehouse consolidation, co-location, disposal, as well as construction and acquisition efforts. OMB is responsible for reporting the progress of agencies’ efforts in reducing the amount of federal real property space under the RTF policy. GSA has two key leadership responsibilities related to real property management. First, GSA’s Public Buildings Service functions as the federal government’s principal landlord, acquiring, managing, and disposing of federally owned real property for which it has custody and control on behalf of federal agencies that occupy the space. Additionally, GSA leases commercial buildings on behalf of agencies and manages the lease agreements. In these situations, GSA executes an occupancy agreement with a customer agency for each space assignment that is similar to a sublease between GSA and the agency. The occupancy agreement outlines both the financial specifics of the agreement and the responsibilities of GSA and the customer agency. There are certain unique advantages for customer agencies when GSA leases on their behalf. For example, GSA is able to enter into longer-term leases, and agencies can release space back to GSA with 4 months’ written notice if certain conditions are met, relieving the agencies of the cost for the returned space. Second, GSA’s Office of Government-wide Policy is responsible for identifying, evaluating, and promoting best practices to improve the efficiency of management processes. In this policy role, GSA provides guidance for federal agencies and publishes performance measures. It also maintains the", "answers": ["The federal government continues to work to reduce its real property inventory and associated costs. GSA provides space for agencies in government-owned and commercially leased buildings. In 2015, the OMB issued a memorandum requiring the 24 agencies with chief financial officers to reduce their domestic office and warehouse space. These agencies are required to set annual reduction targets for a 5-year time period and update their real property plans annually. GAO was asked to review the implementation of this space reduction initiative. This report discusses: (1) the approaches and any challenges the 24 agencies identified to achieving their reduction targets for all their domestic office and warehouse space; (2) the extent these agencies reduced their space and met their fiscal year 2016 targets; and (3) how GSA manages vacated space it had leased to these agencies. GAO conducted a content analysis of the 24 agencies' real property plans for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 and analyzed agencies' data as submitted to GSA on their targets and reductions for fiscal year 2016, the only year for which data were available. GAO selected five agencies as case studies based on several factors, including size of the agencies' office and warehouse portfolio, agency reduction targets, and fiscal year 2016 reported reductions. GAO reviewed relevant documentation and interviewed officials from GSA, OMB, and GAO's case study agencies. GAO provided a draft of this product to GSA, OMB, and our case study agencies for comment. GAO incorporated technical comments, as appropriate. Most of the 24 agencies with chief financial officers reported to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the General Services Administration (GSA) that they planned to consolidate their office and warehouse space and allocate fewer square feet per employee as the key ways to achieve their space reduction targets. For example, the Department of Agriculture reported it will consolidate staff from five component agencies in two office buildings. When complete, the space allocated per employee will average about 250 square feet down from a high of 420 square feet per employee. In taking these actions, the agencies most often identified the cost of space reduction projects as a challenge to achieving their targets. Agencies cited costs such as for space renovations to accommodate more staff and required environmental clean-up before disposing of property as challenges to completing projects. Some agencies required to maintain offices across the country reported that their mission requirements limit their ability to reduce their space. In fiscal year 2016, 17 of the 24 agencies reported they reduced their space, but had varying success achieving their first-year targets. Of the 17 agencies, 9 exceeded their target and reduced more space than planned, 7 missed their target (by anywhere between 2.8 and 96.7 percent), and 1 reduced space, despite a targeted increase. Agency officials said that it is not unusual for projects to shift to different years and that such shifts could lead to missing targets one year and exceeding them the next. GSA has processes to manage the space vacated by agencies that is leased through GSA. For example, starting in November 2016, GSA started tracking agencies' space release requests centrally to help standardize the process and established an e-mail address to which agencies can submit requests. GSA relies on regional offices to manage real property in their regions and to identify tenants for vacant space or to remove unused space from the inventory. GSA's regional officials said regular monitoring and coordinating with agencies minimizes the likelihood GSA is caught off guard by a return of space. These processes also help them to plan ahead. GSA met its 2016 performance goal to have an annual vacant space rate of no more than 3.2 percent in its federally owned and leased buildings. However, given the recent implementation of the space reduction initiative, it is too early to determine the extent to which agencies will return space to GSA prior to the end of their leases and the effect on GSA's inventory."], "all_classes": null, "length": 7578}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points. The report discusses the decline of cash as a payment method and the rise of electronic payments, including traditional ones like credit cards and newer ones like cryptocurrencies. It also mentions the potential benefits and drawbacks of a cashless society.\n\nFirst, the report starts by talking about technological advances making electronic payments more available, convenient, and cost-efficient. Established technologies like credit and debit cards are popular. Newer digital currencies, such as cryptocurrencies, offer alternatives that are independent from traditional systems. However, they are not yet widely adopted.\n\nThe report notes that while cash remains an important method of payment in the U.S., there's anecdotal evidence that some businesses are choosing not to accept cash, especially those with low-dollar-value transactions. In countries like Sweden, cash usage is becoming scarce. Central banks worldwide are considering issuing government-backed digital currencies, which are only under consideration at this time.\n\nThe report then discusses the implications of a reduced role for cash. Proponents argue that reducing the use of physical currency would generate important benefits, including improved efficiency of the payment system, a reduction of crime, and less constrained monetary policy. On the other hand, opponents argue that significant reductions in cash usage and acceptance would further marginalize people with limited access to the financial system, increase the financial system's vulnerability to cyberattack, and reduce personal privacy.\n\nThe report is divided into two parts. Part I analyzes cash and noncash payment systems, including traditional ones like credit cards and alternative ones like cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). It examines the advantages and costs specific to each system and the potential obstacles to the adoption of alternative electronic payment systems. Part II analyzes the potential implications of a reduced role for cash in the economy, including potential benefits, costs, and risks. The report also includes an Appendix with two international case studies: Sweden and Kenya.\n\nIn the U.S., cash is still used for a significant portion of transactions, especially small in-person ones. However, the report mentions that the use of cash is declining, and there are concerns about the impact on certain groups, like the unbanked. The report also discusses the potential benefits of a cashless society, such as reduced crime and better monetary policy, but also the risks, like increased cyber vulnerability and loss of privacy.\n\nThe report also talks about the economic effects of cash, including seigniorage (the profit from producing", "answers": ["Electronic forms of payment have become increasingly available, convenient, and cost efficient due to technological advances in digitization and data processing. Anecdotal reporting and certain analyses suggest that businesses and consumers are increasingly eschewing cash payments in favor of electronic payment methods. Such trends have led analysts and policymakers to examine the possibility that the use and acceptance of cash will significantly decline in coming years and to consider the effects of such an evolution. Cash is still a common and widely accepted payment system in the United States. Cash's advantages include its simplicity and robustness as a payment system that requires no ancillary technologies. In addition, it provides privacy in transactions and protection from cyber threats or financial institution failures. However, using cash involves costs to businesses and consumers who pay fees to obtain, manage, and protect cash and exposes its users to loss through misplacement, theft, or accidental destruction of physical currency. Cash also concurrently generates government revenues through \"profits\" earned by producing it and by acting as interest-free liabilities to the Federal Reserve (in contrast to reserve balances on which the Federal Reserve pays interest), while reducing government revenues by facilitating some tax avoidance. The relative advantages and costs of various payment methods will largely determine whether and to what degree electronic payment systems will displace cash. Traditional noncash payment systems (such as credit and debit cards and interbank clearing systems) involving intermediaries such as banks and central banks address some of the shortcomings of cash payments. These systems can execute payments over physical distance, allow businesses and consumers to avoid some of the costs and risks of using cash, and are run by generally trusted and closely regulated intermediaries. However, the maintenance and operation of legacy noncash systems involve their own costs, and the intermediaries charge fees to recoup those costs and earn profits. The time it takes to finalize certain transactions—including crediting customer accounts for check or electronic deposits—can lead to consumers incurring additional costs. In addition, these systems involve cybersecurity risks and generally require customers to divulge their private personal information to gain system access, which raises privacy concerns. To date, the migration away from cash has largely been in favor of traditional noncash payment systems; however, some observers predict new alternative systems will play a larger role in the future. Such alternative systems aim to address some of the inefficiencies and risks of traditional noncash systems, but face obstacles to achieving that aim and involve costs of their own. Private systems using distributed ledger technology, such as cryptocurrencies, may not serve the main functions of money well and face challenges to widespread acceptance and technological scalability. These systems also raise concerns among certain observers related to whether these systems could facilitate crime, provide inadequate protections to consumers, and may adversely affect governments' ability to implement or transmit monetary policy. The potential for increased payment efficiency from these systems is promising enough that certain central banks have investigated the possibility of issuing government-backed, electronic-only currencies—called central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)—in such a way that the benefits of certain alternative payment systems could be realized with appropriately mitigated risk. How CBDCs would be created and function are still matters of speculation at this time, and the possibility of their introduction raises questions about the appropriate role of a central bank in the financial system and the economy. If the relative benefits and costs of cash and the various other payment methods evolve in such a way that cash is significantly displaced as a commonly accepted form of payment, that evolution could have a number of effects, both positive and negative, on the economy and society. Proponents of reducing cash usage (or even eliminating it all together and becoming a cashless society) argue that doing so will generate important benefits, including potentially improved efficiency of the payment system, a reduction of crime, and less constrained monetary policy. Proponents of maintaining cash as a payment option argue that significant reductions in cash usage and acceptance would further marginalize people with limited access to the financial system, increase the financial system's vulnerability to cyberattack, and reduce personal privacy. Based on their assessment of the magnitude of these benefits and costs and the likelihood that market forces will displace cash as a payment system, policymakers may choose to encourage or discourage this trend."], "all_classes": null, "length": 9601}

These dams were primarily constructed for irrigation, flood control, and other public purposes, and the PMAs were established to provide electricity to communities and farms that private utilities would not serve profitably. The PMAs are responsible for selling power at cost-based rates, with a preference for public utility districts and cooperatives. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) oversees rate setting to ensure repayment of federal facility costs. Since FY2011, PMA revenues have been classified as discretionary offsetting receipts, giving the agencies a \"net-zero\" spending authority. Only the capital expenses of WAPA and SWPA require congressional appropriations. Each PMA has unique regional challenges and operations. BPA, the first PMA, is self-financed and operates a large transmission system in the Pacific Northwest, marketing power from 31 federal dams. It has a significant debt and is exploring ways to manage its financial health and address challenges from renewable energy sources. BPA is also involved in a debt management agreement with Energy Northwest, which could result in significant savings for its customers. The PMAs face various challenges, including environmental concerns related to the operation of federal dams, the need to modernize infrastructure, and the impact of changing energy markets. Additionally, there have been proposals to privatize the PMAs, which could affect the statutory preference for public utilities and the ability of the PMAs to provide electricity at the lowest possible cost. The report highlights the importance of the PMAs in meeting the energy needs of the United States and the need for continued oversight and support to ensure their effectiveness and sustainability.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about the federal Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs).

These agencies were created to manage and market electricity from federal dams, which were built for irrigation, flood control, and other public purposes. The PMAs provide electricity to communities and farms that private utilities wouldn't serve profitably.

Each PMA operates in a distinct geographic area. Congressional interest in the PMAs has included diverse issues such as rate setting, cost and compliance associated with the Endangered Species Act (ESA; P.L. 93-205; 16 U.S.C. §§1531 et seq.), and questions of privatization of these federal agencies. In general, the PMAs came into being because of the government's need to dispose of electric power produced by dams constructed largely for irrigation, flood control, or other purposes, and to achieve small community and farm electrification—that is, providing service to customers whom it would not have been profitable for a private utility to serve. With minor exceptions, these agencies market the electric power produced by federal dams constructed, owned, and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) and the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR). By statute, PMAs must give preference to public utility districts and cooperatives (e.g., \"preference customers\"), and sell their power at cost-based rates set at the lowest possible rate consistent with sound business principles. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates PMA rates to ensure that they are set high enough to repay the U.S. Treasury for the portion of federal facility costs allocated to hydropower beneficiaries. With energy and capacity markets changing in the western United States (especially with the growing need to integrate increasing amounts of variable renewable sources), and the development of the Energy Imbalance Market in the West, BPA and WAPA may have to adapt their plans with regard to generation needs and how transmission systems are developed. In 2018, the Trump Administration proposed to sell the transmission assets (lines, towers, substations, and/or rights of way) owned and operated by the federal Power Marketing Administrations. The proposal suggested that \"eliminating or reducing\" the federal government's role in owning and operating transmission assets, and increasing the private sector's role, would \"encourage a more efficient allocation of economic resources and mitigate unnecessary risk to taxpayers.\" The resulting PMA entities would then contract with other utilities to provide transmission services for the delivery of federal power, similar to what SEPA does currently. Reportedly, the proposed sale of PMA assets was dropped after opposition to the plan emerged from stakeholders. Under Section 208 of the Urgent Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1986 (P.L. 99-349), the executive branch is prohibited from spending funds to study or draft proposals to transfer from federal control any portion of the assets of the PMAs unless specifically authorized by Congress. Environmental, fishing, and tribal advocates have sued the federal government over concerns that operating rules for hydropower dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers (i.e., the National Marine Fisheries Service Biological Opinion) are inadequate to ensure survival of species threatened or endangered under the ESA. In 2016, a federal judge overturned a previous management plan for the dams, finding that it would not be sufficient to protect salmon runs, and ordered a new management plan that could include removing the dams. However, in 2018, President Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum accelerating the process for a new management plan, requiring the biological opinion to be ready by 2020. Since FY2011, power revenues associated with the PMAs have been classified as discretionary offsetting receipts (i.e., receipts that are available for spending by the PMAs), thus the agencies are sometimes noted as having a \"net-zero\" spending authority.

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report starts by explaining the role of the minority leader, who is the head of the \"loyal opposition.\" They are traditionally the nominee for Speaker at the start of a new Congress, and the Speaker-elect is usually elected on a straight party-line vote. The main problem for the minority leader is the subordinate status of the minority party in an institution that favors majority rule. The report mentions that the minority leader's primary goal is to recapture majority control of the House. \n\nThe minority leader is elected every two years by secret ballot of their party caucus or conference. They are typically experienced lawmakers. The current minority leader is Kevin McCarthy, R-CA, who had a long tenure in the House, including as majority leader. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-CA, had a similar path, serving as minority leader multiple times. \n\nThe report then discusses the historical origin of the minority leader position. Before the 19th century, there were no official party leaders, and the role of opposition leader was informal. The position became more formalized in the late 19th century, with the establishment of party leadership structures. \n\nThe responsibilities of the minority leader are based on tradition and custom. They serve as the leader and spokesperson for the minority party, and participate in institutional prerogatives.

Before that, congressional parties were disorganized, and there was no clear leader for the opposition. The emergence of a two-party system on Capitol Hill with official titles for party leaders is highlighted. \n\nThe minority leader has both formal and informal responsibilities. Formally, they are responsible for certain roles and responsibilities as specified by their party's rules. For example, under Republican Conference rules, the minority leader nominates party members to certain committees. \n\nInformally, the minority leader is expected to handle a wide range of party assignments, such as coordinating with other leaders to develop party policy, guiding legislation through the House, resisting undesirable programs, and managing intraparty conflicts. \n\nThe report also discusses various", "answers": ["The House minority leader, the head of the \"loyal opposition,\" is elected every two years by secret ballot of his or her party caucus or conference.

{"pred": " Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits sex discrimination in educational programs receiving federal funding. While the statute does not explicitly address sexual harassment or abuse, federal courts have interpreted it to allow victims of such conduct to seek damages through private rights of action. The Supreme Court established that a school district can be held liable for damages if it responded to a teacher's sexual abuse or harassment with deliberate indifference. The Court also held that a school board may be liable under Title IX for a deliberately indifferent response to student-on-student sexual harassment. Federal agencies, such as the Department of Education (ED), have also determined that educational institutions can be held responsible for instances of sexual harassment under Title IX in certain circumstances. Title IX is primarily enforced in two ways: (1) through private rights of action directly against schools by or on behalf of students subject to such harassment in certain circumstances; and (2) by federal agencies that provide funding to educational programs. The latter enforcement prong makes compliance with its antidiscrimination mandate a condition for receiving federal funding in any education program or activity. Title IX applies to federal-funded schools at all levels of education. For instance, all public school districts receive some federal financial assistance, as do most institutions of higher education through participation in federal student aid programs. Notably, when any part of a school district or institution of higher education receives federal funds, all of the recipient's operations are covered by Title IX. The text of Title IX does not expressly mention sexual abuse or harassment, while current regulations implementing the statute also do not explicitly address sexual harassment (although the regulations do require schools to designate at least one employee to function as a Title IX Coordinator). In each of the last several presidential administrations, however, the Department of Education (ED) has issued guidance documents that instruct schools regarding their responsibilities under Title IX when addressing allegations of sexual harassment. In response, educational institutions have developed procedures and practices to investigate and respond to allegations of sexual harassment and assault. And ED recently issued another notice of proposed rulemaking, after having revoked some of its prior guidance to schools in 2017. As discussed in this report, if adopted, the regulations would significantly change educational institutions' responsibilities for responding to sexual harassment allegations. To place the proposed Title IX regulations in context, this report provides background on the legal landscape that informs the proposal. First, the report examines how federal courts have understood Title IX's requirements in the context of private rights of action brought by students directly against educational institutions seeking damages for sexual abuse or harassment. The report", "answers": ["Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) provides an avenue of legal relief for victims of sexual abuse and harassment at educational institutions. It bars discrimination \"on the basis of sex\" in an educational program or activity receiving federal funding. Although Title IX makes no explicit reference to sexual harassment or abuse, the Supreme Court and federal agencies have determined that such conduct can sometimes constitute discrimination in violation of the statute; educational institutions in some circumstances can be held responsible when a teacher sexually harasses a student or when one student harasses another. Title IX is mainly enforced (1) through private rights of action brought directly against schools by or on behalf of students subjected to sexual misconduct; and (2) by federal agencies that provide funding to educational programs. To establish liability in a private right of action, a party seeking damages for a Title IX violation must satisfy the standards set forth by the Supreme Court in Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District, decided in 1998, and Davis Next Friend LaShonda D. v. Monroe County Board of Education, decided the next year. Gebser provides that when a teacher commits harassment against a student, a school district is liable only when it has actual knowledge of allegations by an \"appropriate person,\" and so deficiently responds to those allegations that its response amounts to deliberate indifference to the discrimination. Davis instructs that, besides showing actual knowledge by an appropriate person and deliberate indifference, a plaintiff suing for damages for sexual harassment committed by a student must show that the conduct was \"so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive\" that it denied the victim equal access to educational opportunities or benefits. Taken together, the Supreme Court's decisions set forth a high threshold for a private party seeking damages against an educational institution based on its response to sexual harassment. In turn, federal appellate courts have differed in how to apply the standards set in Gebser and Davis, diverging on the nature and amount of evidence sufficient to support a claim. In each of the last several presidential administrations, the Department of Education (ED) issued a number of guidance documents that instruct schools on their responsibilities under Title IX when addressing allegations of sexual harassment. These documents—while sometimes subject to change—generally reflected a different standard than the Supreme Court case law addressing private rights of action for damages for sexual abuse or harassment (the Court in Davis acknowledged that the threshold for liability in a private right of action could be higher than the standard imposed in the administrative enforcement context). Those guidance documents had, among other things, established that sometimes a school could be held responsible for instances of sexual harassment by a teacher, irrespective of actual notice; and schools could be held responsible for student-on-student harassment if a \"responsible employee\" knew or should have known of the harassment (constructive notice). ED's previous guidance also instructed educational institutions that they sometimes could be responsible for responding to incidents of sexual harassment occurring off campus. ED also cautioned schools on the use of mediation to resolve allegations of sexual harassment. With regard to the procedures used by schools to resolve sexual harassment allegations, ED informed schools that they must use the preponderance of the evidence standard to establish culpability, and the agency strongly discouraged schools from allowing parties in a hearing to personally cross-examine one another. In response to guidance from ED, as well as increased oversight from the department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) between 2011 and 2016, schools developed several procedures to ensure that their responses to allegations of sexual harassment and assault complied with Title IX. A number of students faced with disciplinary action by public universities raised constitutional challenges to the Title IX procedures used to find them responsible for sexual misconduct, arguing that universities violated the Due Process Clause in handling their case. ED issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in late 2018, after revoking some of its previous guidance to schools in 2017. The proposed regulations would, in several ways, tether the administrative requirements for schools to the standard set by the Supreme Court in Gebser and Davis. In doing so, the proposed regulations would depart from the standards set by ED in previous guidance documents (some of which have since been rescinded). The new regulations would require \"actual notice,\" rather than constructive notice, of harassment by an education institution to trigger a school's Title IX responsibilities, and provide that a school's response to allegations of sexual harassment will violate Title IX only if it amounts to deliberate indifference. In addition, the new regulations would more narrowly define what conduct qualifies as sexual harassment under Title IX, and also impose new procedural requirements, which appear to reflect due process concerns, when schools investigate sexual harassment or assault allegations and make determinations of culpability."], "all_classes": null, "length": 14692}
{"pred": " The National Science Foundation (NSF) utilizes two programs to bring in rotators: the IPA (Interagency Personnel) program and the VSEE (Voluntary Selective Exchange) program. These programs differ in employment status, compensation, and oversight. IPA rotators are employed by their home institutions and enter into agreements with NSF, which detail their salaries and benefits. NSF reimburses its cost-sharing amounts to home institutions, which continue to pay rotators’ full salaries and benefits. Unlike VSEE rotators, who are federal employees on a nonpaid leave from their home institutions, IPA rotators may receive salaries that exceed the federal maximum for their position. However, if their salary is below the minimum, NSF supplements it to the minimum rate. VSEE rotators receive their salaries directly from NSF but are not eligible for certain federal benefits, such as retirement. Instead, NSF reimburses home institutions for the employer’s share of these benefits. NSF sets salaries for VSEE rotators to be generally comparable to their home institutions, taking into account other sources of income and locality pay adjustments. However, because VSEE rotators are federal employees, NSF caps their salaries at the federal maximum for the position. Both IPA and VSEE rotators are eligible for certain other types of reimbursement, such as moving expenses or per diem allowances. Additionally, NSF may reimburse rotators for travel-related expenses related to their participation in the Independent Research and Development program. The report highlights the differences in the use of IPA and VSEE rotators across NSF's seven directorates, with IPA rotators often filling executive positions and VSEE rotators filling program director positions. The report also discusses the cost management strategies adopted by NSF in fiscal year 2017, including a minimum 10 percent cost-share from home institutions, a limit of 12 trips to their home institutions, and no longer reimbursing lost consulting income. These strategies were implemented to reduce costs while maintaining the effectiveness of the IPA program. The report also notes that NSF has not developed an agency-wide workforce strategy for balancing the use of IPA and VSEE rotators with permanent staff, as recommended by the IPA program steering committee. Furthermore, NSF has not fully evaluated the contributions of the IPA and VSEE rotator programs toward achieving human capital goals and programmatic results. The report concludes with two recommendations for NSF: (1) Develop an agency-wide workforce strategy for balancing the use of IPA and VSEE rotators with permanent staff as part of current agency reform planning efforts or updates to its human capital", "answers": ["NSF has identified potential benefits and challenges associated with its use of rotators. Benefits include fresh perspectives and close connections to the scientific community, while challenges include staffing turnover and higher costs for some rotators compared with permanent employees. GAO was asked to review NSF's use and management of the IPA and VSEE rotator programs, among other things. This report examines (1) the number, costs, and uses of NSF rotators for fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2017; (2) the strategies NSF has used to manage rotator costs and the results of these efforts; and (3) the extent to which NSF has a workforce strategy for using rotators and has evaluated the results of its rotator programs. GAO analyzed summary-level data on NSF's rotators; reviewed key documents; interviewed NSF officials; conducted semistructured interviews with a nongeneralizable sample of rotators and permanent federal employees selected from different scientific directorates within NSF; and compared NSF's management of the program to key principles for effective strategic workforce planning. The numbers of rotators—outside scientists, engineers, and educators on temporary assignment—at the National Science Foundation (NSF) and their costs in proportion to other staff remained relatively stable in fiscal years 2008 through 2017. Most rotators joined NSF under its Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) mobility program. IPA rotators comprised about 12 percent of NSF's workforce and 17 percent of staff costs on average and were not subject to a federal salary cap. They remain employees of their home institutions, with NSF reimbursing the institutions for most of their salaries and benefits. The remaining rotators are considered temporary federal employees under the Visiting Scientist, Engineer, and Educator (VSEE) program; their salaries could not exceed the federal maximum for their positions. Beginning in fiscal year 2017, NSF adopted IPA rotator program cost management strategies expected to achieve the greatest savings with the least harm to recruitment, but NSF officials said it is too soon to determine the full results. For example, for new IPA rotators who had not yet begun negotiating their assignments, NSF began requiring their home institutions to pay for 10 percent of the rotators' salary and benefits. NSF officials told GAO they expect to issue a report evaluating the strategies in December 2018. NSF's IPA program steering committee recommended developing a workforce strategy for balancing the agency's use of rotators with federal staff, but as of June 2018, NSF had not developed a strategy or fully evaluated the IPA and VSEE rotator programs' results, as called for by GAO's key principles for effective strategic workforce planning. NSF officials said they recognized the value of a workforce strategy but were focusing instead on other workforce planning efforts, and they had not fully evaluated program results in part because rotators are blended into the agency's permanent workforce, making a separate evaluation difficult. Without a workforce strategy and evaluation of results, NSF is limited in its ability to manage and, if warranted, adjust its use of rotators. GAO recommends that NSF develop an agency-wide strategy for balancing the agency's use of rotators with permanent staff and evaluate the contributions of its rotator programs toward NSF's human capital goals and programmatic results.

Additionally, the possibility of extending certain temporary housing-related tax provisions may be considered. The report provides a high-level overview of the most prominent housing-related issues that may be of interest during the 116th Congress, though it does not offer detailed analysis. It includes references to more in-depth CRS reports on these issues where possible.\n\nThe report begins by providing background on housing and mortgage market conditions at the national level. It notes that rising home prices, relatively low interest rates, and increasing rental costs have been prominent features of housing and mortgage markets in recent years. Although interest rates have remained low, rising house prices and rental costs that in many cases have outpaced income growth have led to increased concerns about housing affordability for both prospective homebuyers and renters.\n\nThe report discusses current trends in owner-occupied housing and mortgage market indicators. It notes that national house prices have been increasing on a year-over-year basis since the beginning of 2012, with year-over-year increases exceeding 5% for much of that time period and exceeding 6% for most quarters since mid-2016. These increases follow almost five years of house price declines in the years during and surrounding the economic recession of 2007-2009 and associated housing market turmoil. House price increases slowed somewhat during 2018, but year-over-year house prices still increased by nearly 6% during the fourth quarter of 2018. House prices, and changes in house prices, vary greatly across local housing markets. Some areas of the country are experiencing rapid increases in house prices, while other areas are experiencing slower or stagnating house price growth. Similarly, prices have fully regained or even exceeded their pre-recession levels in nominal terms in many parts of the country, but in other areas prices remain below those levels.\n\nThe report also discusses the impact of rising house prices on housing affordability. While rising prices reduce affordability for prospective homebuyers, they are generally beneficial for current homeowners due to the increased home equity that accompanies them (although rising house prices also have the potential to negatively impact affordability for current homeowners through increased property taxes).\n\nThe report highlights that mortgage interest rates have been low by historical standards for several years.

Furthermore, a new director for the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's regulator and conservator, was sworn in on April 15, 2019. Congress may take an interest in any administrative changes that FHFA might make to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under new leadership.

Considerations related to housing and the federal response to major disasters, including oversight of the implementation of certain changes related to Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) assistance that were enacted in the previous Congress. Consideration of legislation related to certain federal housing programs that provide assistance to Native Americans living in tribal areas. Consideration of legislation to extend certain temporary tax provisions that are currently expired, including housing-related provisions that provide a tax exclusion for canceled mortgage debt and allow for the deductibility of mortgage insurance premiums, respectively. Housing and mortgage market conditions provide context for these and other issues that Congress may consider, although housing markets are local in nature and national housing market indicators do not necessarily accurately reflect conditions in specific communities. On a national basis, some key characteristics of owner-occupied housing markets and the mortgage market in recent years include increasing housing prices, low mortgage interest rates, and home sales that have been increasing but constrained by a limited inventory of homes on the market. Key characteristics of rental housing markets include an increasing number of renters, low rental vacancy rates, and increasing rents. Rising home prices and rents that have outpaced income growth in recent years have led to policymakers and others increasingly raising concerns about the affordability of both owner-occupied and rental housing. Affordability challenges are most prominent among the lowest-income renter households, reflecting a shortage of rental housing units that are both affordable and available to this population."], "all_classes": null, "length": 7818}

It mentions that corporations operating in multiple jurisdictions face compliance challenges. Some strategies, like inversions, mergers, and expatriation, are used to reduce tax liabilities. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (JOBS Act) aimed to limit these benefits by requiring substantial business operations in the foreign country. However, some companies still managed to invert, especially through mergers with foreign firms. The Treasury Department introduced regulations in 2014 that further restricted inversions, leading to a decline in such activities. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 made additional changes to the international tax rules, including provisions aimed at discouraging inversions. The report also discusses the history of inversions, the legislative actions taken, and the ongoing debates about how to address these issues. It mentions that while some regulatory changes have slowed inversions, others have continued, and there are still discussions about further reforms.\n\nNow, I need to condense this into a one-page summary. I should start by outlining the main points: the structure of the U.S. corporate tax, the concept of inversions, the legislative responses (like the JOBS Act), the subsequent regulatory actions, the impact of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and the ongoing discussions about policy options. I need to make sure the summary is concise, covers all the key aspects, and is structured logically. Also, I should avoid any technical jargon and keep the language clear and straightforward. Let me start drafting the summary now.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of the report on U.S. corporate income tax and inversions. Let me start by outlining the key points from the report. \n\nFirst, the report explains that the U.S. corporate income tax is based on worldwide economic activity. This means that all income earned by a corporation, whether inside or outside the U.S., is subject to U.S. tax. However, corporations that operate in multiple jurisdictions face challenges in tax administration and compliance. \n\nThe report discusses how some corporations use strategies like inversions, mergers, and expatriation to reduce their U.S. and worldwide tax liabilities. These strategies often involve changing the country of residence", "answers": ["News reports in the late 1990s and early 2000s drew attention to a phenomenon sometimes called corporate \"inversions\" or \"expatriations\": instances where U.S. firms reorganize their structure so that the \"parent\" element of the group is a foreign corporation rather than a corporation chartered in the United States. The main objective of these transactions was tax savings, and they involved little to no shift in actual economic activity. Bermuda and the Cayman Islands (countries with no corporate income tax) were the locations of many of the newly created parent corporations. These types of inversions largely ended with the enactment of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (JOBS Act; P.L. 108-357), which denied the tax benefits of an inversion if the original U.S. stockholders owned 80% or more of the new firm. The act effectively ended shifts to tax havens where no real business activity took place. However, two avenues for inverting remained. The act allowed a firm to invert if it has substantial business operations in the country where the new parent was to be located; the regulations at one point set a 10% level of these business operations. Several inversions using the business activity test resulted in Treasury regulations in 2012 that increased the activity requirement to 25%, effectively closing off this method. Firms could also invert by merging with a foreign company if the original U.S. stockholders owned less than 80% of the new firm. If the original U.S. shareholders owned less than 60%, the firm was not considered as inverting. Two features made a country an attractive destination: a low corporate tax rate and a territorial tax system that did not tax foreign source income. The U.K. joined countries such as Ireland, Switzerland, and Canada as targets for inverting when it adopted a territorial tax in 2009. At the same time, the U.K. also lowered its rate (from 25% to 20% by 2015). Inverted firms could reduce worldwide taxes by stripping taxable earnings out of the new U.S. subsidiary, largely through allocating debt to that subsidiary. Soon after, several high-profile companies indicated an interest in merging with a non-U.S. headquartered company, including Pfizer, Chiquita, AbbVie, and Burger King. This \"second wave\" of inversions again raised concerns about an erosion of the U.S. tax base. Chiquita and AbbVie canceled their plans in the wake of 2014 Treasury regulations, but Burger King and other firms completed merger plans. Pfizer subsequently terminated its planned merger with Allergan after Treasury regulations issued in 2016. Evidence suggests that these Treasury regulations have been an important factor in subsequently decreasing these merger-related inversions. Two policy options had been discussed in response: a general reform of the U.S. corporate tax and specific provisions to deal with tax-motivated international mergers. In December 2017, P.L. 115-97 (popularly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) lowered the corporate tax rate as part of broader tax reform which some argued would slow the rate of inversions. Other tax reform proposals suggested that if the United States moved to a territorial tax, the incentive to invert would be eliminated. There were concerns that a territorial tax could worsen the profit-shifting that already exists among multinational firms. P.L. 115-97, while moving in some ways to a territorial tax, also instituted a number of measures aimed at combatting profit shifting, including a global minimum tax on intangible income that limited the tax benefits of a territorial tax. The second option is to directly target inversions. The 2017 act included several provisions that discouraged inversions. In addition, further anti-inversion provisions have been introduced, most recently H.R. 5108 and S. 2459 in the 115th Congress, to treat all firms in which former U.S. shareholders have more than 50% ownership (or in which management and control is in the United States) as U.S. firms. These bills also provided that debt could also be allocated to the U.S. member of a worldwide operation in proportion to the U.S. ownership of assets."], "all_classes": null, "length": 9230}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is about the costs of UN peacekeeping operations compared to a hypothetical U.S. operation, specifically focusing on MINUSCA in the Central African Republic (CAR). \n\nFirst, the report mentions that as of June 30, 2017, the UN had 71 peacekeeping operations since 1948, with 16 active ones. Eight of these are in sub-Saharan Africa. The report explains that UN peacekeeping has evolved from primarily military roles to multidimensional operations that include civilian and police personnel. These operations aim to protect civilians, support elections, and restore the rule of law.\n\nThe report then compares the UN's costs for MINUSCA to a hypothetical U.S. operation. The UN spent about $2.4 billion on MINUSCA from April 2014 to June 2017. The estimated cost for a U.S. operation is nearly $5.7 billion, which is more than twice the UN cost. The U.S. cost includes higher expenses for transporting supplies, staffing with reservists, facilities, communications, and medical care. The UN's costs are lower because they rely on local infrastructure and reimburse troop-contributing countries for equipment. \n\nThe report also discusses the factors contributing to the cost differences. These include the cost of sourcing and transporting equipment and supplies, staffing and compensating military and police personnel, and maintaining facilities and communications and intelligence systems. The U.S. would have higher costs due to different operational, structural, and doctrinal approaches compared to the UN.\n\nThe report highlights the strengths of both UN and U.S. peacekeeping operations. The UN benefits from international and local acceptance, access to global expertise, and the ability to leverage assistance from multilateral donors and development banks. The U.S. has advantages in faster deployment, superior command and control, logistics, intelligence, and counterterrorism capabilities.\n\nThe report was prepared by the GAO and sent to relevant committees and officials. It also mentions that the U.S. is the largest financial contributor to UN peacekeeping operations, with an average contribution of about $2.1 billion per year from fiscal years 2014 to 2017.\n\nI need to condense all this into a one-page summary. Let me structure it with an introduction, key points about the UN and U.S. operations, the cost", "answers": ["To promote international peace and security, the UN had 16 ongoing peacekeeping operations worldwide as of June 30, 2017, with a total budget of almost $8 billion in UN fiscal year 2017 and contributions of over 100,000 military, police, and civilian personnel from more than 120 countries. The United States is the largest financial contributor to UN peacekeeping operations, providing an average of about 28 percent of total funding annually. The Department of State Authorities Act, Fiscal Year 2017, includes a provision for GAO to compare the costs, strengths, and limitations of UN and U.S. peacekeeping operations. This report (1) compares the reported costs of a specific UN operation to the estimated costs of a hypothetical, comparable operation implemented by the United States; (2) identifies factors that affect cost differences; and (3) identifies stakeholder views on the relative strengths of UN and U.S. peacekeeping operations. GAO worked with the UN, DOD, and State to generate a cost estimate of a hypothetical U.S.-led operation in the Central African Republic comparable to MINUSCA. GAO developed this estimate using DOD's cost estimating tool for contingency operations and State data on civilian costs, assuming a U.S. operation using roughly the same levels of military and civilian personnel as MINUSCA. The cost estimate should not be construed as suggesting that the United States would likely implement such an operation in the Central African Republic or that it would implement such an operation in the same way. GAO is making no recommendations. Based on United Nations (UN) and Departments of Defense (DOD) and State (State) data, GAO estimates that it would cost the United States more than twice as much as it would cost the UN to implement a hypothetical operation comparable to the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA). MINUSCA cost the UN approximately $2.4 billion for the first 39 months of the operation. GAO estimates that a hypothetical U.S. peacekeeping operation in the Central African Republic of roughly the same size and duration would cost nearly $5.7 billion—almost eight times more than the $700 million the United States contributed to MINUSCA over the same time period. Various factors affect differences between the actual cost of MINUSCA and the estimated cost of a hypothetical, comparable U.S. operation in the Central African Republic. The United States and the UN would source and transport some supplies and equipment differently, affecting the cost of both operations; for example, the United States would airlift water into the Central African Republic, while the UN does not do so to the same extent. The United States also would incur the cost of civilian police and military reservist salaries, while the UN does not pay any troop or police salaries. Finally, some higher standards for facilities, intelligence, and medical services increase the U.S. cost estimate relative to UN costs for similar operational elements. UN and U.S. peacekeeping operations have various relative strengths, according to U.S. and UN officials. These officials said that, because the UN is a multilateral organization, UN peacekeeping operations have international acceptance and are more likely to be viewed as impartial. Officials also said that the UN enjoys global access to expertise and experience, and can leverage assistance from multilateral donors and development banks. Relative strengths of a U.S. peacekeeping operation would include faster deployment and superior command and control, logistics, intelligence, and counterterrorism capability, according to U.S. and UN officials."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5006}
{"pred": " The report provides an in-depth examination of the U.S. Small Business Administration's (SBA) size standards, which are used to determine eligibility for SBA assistance. The Small Business Act of 1953 (P.L. 83-163, as amended) authorized the SBA and justified its existence on the grounds that small businesses are essential to the maintenance of the free enterprise system. Congress intended to assist small businesses as a means to deter monopoly and oligarchy formation within all industries and the market failures caused by the elimination or reduction of competition in the marketplace. The SBA was authorized to establish size standards to ensure that only small businesses were provided SBA assistance. These standards are based on the firm's size relative to other firms in its field, with the goal of maintaining \"the integrity of independent enterprise.\" The SBA defines a small business as one that is organized for profit; has a place of business in the United States; operates primarily within the United States or makes a significant contribution to the U.S. economy through payment of taxes or use of American products, materials, or labor; is independently owned and operated; and is not dominant in its field on a national basis. The business may be a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or any other legal form. The SBA currently uses two types of size standards to determine program eligibility: (1) industry-specific size standards and (2) alternative size standards based on the applicant's maximum tangible net worth and average net income after federal taxes. The SBA's industry-specific size standards are also used to determine eligibility for federal small business contracting purposes. The SBA conducts an analysis of various economic factors, such as each industry's overall competitiveness and the competitiveness of firms within each industry, to determine its size standards. The analysis is designed to ensure that only small businesses receive SBA assistance and that these small businesses are not dominant in their field on a national basis.

Although there is bipartisan agreement that the nation's small businesses play an important role in the American economy, there are differences of opinion concerning how to define them. The Small Business Act of 1953 (P.L. 83-163, as amended) authorized the SBA to establish size standards to ensure that only small businesses receive SBA assistance. The SBA currently uses two types of size standards to determine SBA program eligibility: industry-specific size standards and alternative size standards based on the applicant's maximum tangible net worth and average net income after federal taxes. The SBA's industry-specific size standards determine program eligibility for firms in 1,036 industrial classifications in 23 sub-industry activities described in the 2017 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The size standards are based on one of four measures: (1) number of employees, (2) average annual receipts in the previous three (may soon be the previous five) years, (3) average asset size as reported in the firm's four quarterly financial statements for the preceding year, or (4) a combination of number of employees and barrel per day refining capacity. Overall, about 97% of all employer firms qualify as small under the SBA's size standards. These firms represent about 30% of industry receipts. The SBA conducts an analysis of various economic factors, such as each industry's overall competitiveness and the competitiveness of firms within each industry, to determine its size standards. However, in the absence of precise statutory guidance and consensus on how to define small, the SBA's size standards have often been challenged, typically by industry representatives seeking to increase the number of firms eligible for assistance and by Members concerned that the size standards may not adequately target assistance to firms that they consider to be truly small. This report provides a historical examination of the SBA's size standards and assesses competing views concerning how to define a small business. It also discusses P.L. 111-240, the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, which authorized the SBA to establish an alternative size standard using maximum tangible net worth and average net income after federal taxes for both the 7(a) and 504/CDC loan guaranty programs; established, until the SBA acted, an interim alternative size standard for the 7(a) and 504/CDC programs of not more than $15 million in tangible net worth and not more than $5 million in average net income after federal taxes (excluding any carry-over losses) for the two full fiscal years before the date of the application; and required the SBA to conduct a detailed review of not less than one-third of the SBA's industry size standards every 18 months beginning on the new law's date of enactment (September 27, 2010) and ensure that each size standard is reviewed at least once every five years. P.L. 112-239, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, which directed the SBA not to limit the number of size standards and to assign the appropriate size standard to each NAICS industrial classification. This provision addressed the SBA's practice of limiting the number of size standards it used and combining size standards within industrial groups as a means to reduce the complexity of its size standards and to provide greater consistency for industrial classifications that have similar economic characteristics. P.L. 114-328, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, which authorizes the SBA to establish different size standards for agricultural enterprises using existing methods and appeal processes. Previously, the small business size standard for agricultural enterprises was set in statute as having annual receipts not in excess of $750,000. P.L. 115-324, the Small Business Runway Extension Act of 2018, which directs federal agencies proposing a size standard (and, based on report language accompanying the act, presumably the SBA as well) to use the average annual gross receipts from at least the previous five years, instead of the previous three years, when seeking SBA approval to establish a size standard based on annual gross receipts.

{"pred": " The report discusses the shift from defined benefit (DB) to defined contribution (DC) retirement plans over the past three decades. This transition has transferred investment risk from employers to employees. DB plans provide a fixed monthly income based on a formula, while DC plans, such as 401(k) plans, depend on contributions and investment performance. The report highlights that DC plans are more portable, which may lead to early withdrawals of retirement savings. In 2016, there were 656,241 DC and 46,300 DB plans in the United States. Tax incentives are in place to encourage employers to sponsor retirement plans and employees to participate in them. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), employers may sponsor DC retirement plans, including 401(k) plans. The report also discusses the tax implications of early withdrawals, including the 10 percent additional tax for distributions made before age 59½. It highlights the factors that may lead individuals to access their retirement savings early, such as financial hardship, job loss, and the need for education expenses. The report also examines the strategies or policies that might reduce the incidence and amount of early withdrawals of retirement savings. These strategies include modifying existing rules to reduce early withdrawals, such as raising the age at which the additional 10 percent tax applies, allowing individuals to roll existing plan loans into an IRA, and allowing IRA loans. The report also discusses the importance of financial literacy and the role of employers in providing financial wellness programs to help employees manage their retirement savings. The report concludes that while early withdrawals of retirement savings may be necessary for some individuals, they can have significant negative impacts on retirement savings, especially if the retirement account represents the sole source of savings. The report recommends that the Secretary of Labor direct the Assistant Secretary for EBSA, in coordination with IRS, to revise the Form 5500 to require plan sponsors to report qualified plan loan offsets as a separate line item distinct from other types of distributions. This recommendation aims to improve the understanding of how plan loan features might affect long-term retirement savings.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report.

In 2017, U.S. plans and IRAs reportedly held investments worth nearly $17 trillion dollars. Federal law also allows individuals to withdraw assets from these accounts under certain circumstances. DOL and IRS oversee 401(k) plans, and collect annual plan data—including financial information—on the Form 5500. For both IRAs and 401(k) plans, GAO was asked to examine: (1) the incidence and amount of early withdrawals; (2) factors that might lead individuals to access retirement savings early; and (3) policies and strategies that might reduce the incidence and amounts of early withdrawals. To answer these questions, GAO analyzed data from IRS, the Census Bureau, and DOL from 2013 (the most recent complete data available); and interviewed a diverse range of stakeholders identified in the literature, including representatives of companies sponsoring 401(k) plans, plan administrators, subject matter experts, industry representatives, and participant advocates. In 2013 individuals in their prime working years (ages 25 to 55) removed at least $69 billion (+/- $3.5 billion) of their retirement savings early, according to GAO's analysis of 2013 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Department of Labor (DOL) data. Withdrawals from individual retirement accounts (IRA)—$39.5 billion (+/- $2.1 billion)—accounted for much of the money removed early, were equivalent to 3 percent (+/- 0.15 percent) of the age group's total IRA assets, and exceeded their IRA contributions in 2013. Participants in employer-sponsored plans, like 401(k) plans, withdrew at least $29.2 billion (+/- $2.8 billion) early as hardship withdrawals, lump sum payments made at job separation (known as cashouts), and loan balances that borrowers did not repay. Hardship withdrawals in 2013 were equivalent to about 0.5 percent (+/-0.06 percent) of the age group's total plan assets and about 8 percent (+/- 0.9 percent) of their contributions. However, the incidence and amount of certain unrepaid plan loans cannot be determined because the Form 5500—the federal government's primary source of information on employee benefit plans—does not capture these data. Stakeholders GAO interviewed identified flexibilities in plan rules and individuals' pressing financial needs, such as out-of-pocket medical costs, as factors affecting early withdrawals of retirement savings. Stakeholders said that certain plan rules, such as setting high minimum loan thresholds, may cause individuals to take out more of their savings than they need. Stakeholders also identified several elements of the job separation process affecting early withdrawals, such as difficulties transferring account balances to a new plan and plans requiring the immediate repayment of outstanding loans, as relevant factors. Stakeholders GAO interviewed suggested strategies they believed could balance early access to accounts with the need to build long-term retirement savings. For example, plan sponsors said allowing individuals to continue to repay plan loans after job separation, restricting participant access to plan sponsor contributions, allowing partial distributions at job separation, and building emergency savings features into plan designs, could help preserve retirement savings (see figure). However, they noted, each strategy involves tradeoffs, and the strategies' broader implications require further study.

Then it had a brief independence in 1918 until 1921-22 when it was incorporated into the USSR. After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Georgia became independent again. \n\nGeographically, Georgia is in the South Caucasus, between the Black and Caspian Seas, separated from Russia by the Greater Caucasus mountain range. It borders Iran and Turkey. The report mentions the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which has been ongoing for decades. Georgia also has unresolved conflicts with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which are Russian-supported regions. These regions have ethnic groups that identify more with the North Caucasus in Russia. After the 2008 war, Russia recognized these regions and stationed military forces there. \n\nThe report then discusses Georgia's political system, mentioning the Georgian Orthodox Church, which is autocephalous. It notes that Georgia is considered one of the most democratic states among the USSR's successor states, with Freedom House ranking it as the freest post-Soviet state (excluding the Baltic states). The country has a parliamentary system, with the prime minister being the most powerful executive. The president is the commander in chief of the armed forces and has the power to veto legislation and dissolve parliament under certain circumstances. \n\nThe current government includes Prime Minister Mamuka Bakhtadze, who took office in 2018, and President Salome Zurabishvili, elected in 2018.

The 2016 elections resulted in a significant win for the ruling party, Georgian Dream-Democratic Georgia (GD), which now governs alone. GD won 49% of the party list vote and nearly all majoritarian races, leading to control of more than 75% of parliamentary seats. However, there were concerns about the ruling party's power and lack of checks and balances. \n\nThe report also covers recent political developments, such as the internal tensions", "answers": ["Georgia is one of the United States' closest partners among the states that gained their independence after the USSR collapsed in 1991.

U.S. policy expressly supports Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, and Georgia is a leading recipient of U.S. aid to Europe and Eurasia. Many observers consider Georgia to be one of the most democratic states in the post-Soviet region, even as the country faces ongoing governance challenges. The center-left Georgian Dream-Democratic Georgia party (GD) has close to a three-fourths supermajority in parliament and governs with limited checks and balances. Although Georgia faces high rates of poverty and underemployment, its economy in 2017 and 2018 appeared to show stronger growth than it had in the previous four years. The GD led a coalition to victory in parliamentary elections in 2012 amid growing dissatisfaction with the former ruling party, Mikheil Saakashvili's center-right United National Movement, which came to power as a result of Georgia's 2003 Rose Revolution. In August 2008, Russia went to war with Georgia to prevent Saakashvili's government from reestablishing control over the regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which broke away from Georgia in the early 1990s and became informal Russian protectorates. Congress has expressed firm support for Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-44, Title II, §253) states that the United States \"does not recognize territorial changes effected by force, including the illegal invasions and occupations\" of Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and other territories occupied by Russia. In September 2016, the House of Representatives passed H.Res. 660, which condemns Russia's military intervention and occupation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. In February 2019, the Georgia Support Act (H.R. 598), which originally passed the House by unanimous consent in the 115th Congress (H.R. 6219), was reintroduced in the 116th Congress. The act would express support for Georgia's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, as well as for its democratic development, Euro-Atlantic integration, and peaceful conflict resolution in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.

This report examines (1) the health care needs of Medicare beneficiaries who receive services from the two qualifying hospitals; (2) how Medicare LTCH payment polices could affect the two qualifying hospitals; and (3) how the two qualifying hospitals compare with other LTCHs and other facilities that may treat Medicare patients with similar conditions. GAO analyzed the most recently available Medicare claims and other data for the two qualifying hospitals and other facilities that treat patients with spinal cord injuries. GAO also interviewed HHS officials and stakeholders from the qualifying hospitals, other facilities that treat spinal cord patients, specialty associations, and others. GAO provided a draft of this report to HHS. HHS provided technical comments, which were incorporated as appropriate. We also provided the two qualifying hospitals summaries of information we collected from them, to confirm the accuracy of statements included in our draft report. We incorporated their comments, as appropriate. Spinal cord injuries may result in secondary complications that often lead to decreased functional independence and quality of life. The 21st Century Cures Act changed how Medicare pays certain long-term care hospitals (LTCH) that provide spinal cord specialty treatment. For these hospitals, the act included a temporary exception from how Medicare pays other LTCHs. Two LTCHs—Craig Hospital in Englewood, Colorado and Shepherd Center in Atlanta, Georgia—have qualified for this exception. GAO found that most Medicare beneficiaries treated at these two hospitals typically receive specialized care for multiple chronic conditions and other long-term complications that develop after initial injuries, such as pressure ulcers that can result in life-threatening infection. The two hospitals also provide specialty care for acquired brain injuries, such as traumatic brain injuries. GAO's simulations of Medicare payments to these two hospitals using claims data from two baseline years—fiscal years 2013 and 2016—illustrate potential effects of payment policies. LTCHs are paid under a two-tiered system for care provided to beneficiaries: they receive the LTCH standard federal payment rate—or standard rate—for certain patients discharged from the LTCH, and a generally lower rate—known as a “site-neutral” rate—for all other discharges. Under the temporary exception, Craig Hospital and Shepherd Center receive the standard rate for all discharges during fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Assuming their types of discharges remain the same as in fiscal years 2013 and 2016, GAO's simulations of Medicare payments in the baseline years indicate: Most of the discharges we examined would not qualify for the standard rate, if the exception did not apply. Medicare payments would generally decrease under fiscal year 2020 payment policy, once the exception expires. However, the actual effects of Medicare's payment policies on these two hospitals could vary based on factors, including the severity of patient conditions (e.g., Medicare payment is typically higher for more severe injuries), and whether hospitals' discharges meet criteria for the standard rate. Similarities and differences may exist between the two qualifying hospitals and other facilities that treat Medicare patients with spinal cord and brain injuries. Patients with spinal cord and brain injuries may receive care in other LTCHs, but GAO found that most Medicare beneficiaries at these other LTCHs are treated for conditions other than spinal cord and brain injuries. Certain inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRF) also provide post-acute rehabilitation services to patients with spinal cord and brain injuries. While data limitations make a direct comparison between these facilities and the two qualifying hospitals difficult, GAO identified some similarities and differences. For example, officials from some IRFs we interviewed reported providing several of the same programs and services as the two qualifying hospitals to medically complex patients, but the availability of services and complexity of patients varied. Among other reasons, the different Medicare payment requirements that apply to LTCHs and IRFs affect the types of services they provide and the patients they treat."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8494}
{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about Congressional Gold Medals. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report starts by explaining the history of Congressional Gold Medals, dating back to the late 1700s. It mentions that the first medals were issued by the Continental Congress, and they were meant to honor distinguished contributions, patriotism, and significant events. The report also notes that while there are laws for other awards, there are no permanent statutes specifically for Congressional Gold Medals. Instead, Congress has created them through special legislative actions.\n\nThe report goes on to detail the history of the medals, starting with the first one awarded to George Washington in 1776. It lists several other medals given to military leaders during the Revolutionary War and later conflicts like the War of 1812 and the Mexican War. The report then discusses how the scope of the medals expanded in the 19th century to include nonmilitary achievements, such as the work of Cornelius Vanderbilt, Cyrus Field, and Private George F. Robinson. It also mentions the establishment of the Medal of Honor as a separate military award, which shifted the focus of the Congressional Gold Medal towards recognizing individuals and events.\n\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, the scope of the Congressional Gold Medal has continued to broaden to include recognition of excellence in various fields such as the arts, athletics, aviation, diplomacy, entertainment, exploration, medicine, politics, religion, and science. The report gives examples of the first individuals in these fields to receive the medal, such as George M. Cohan for his patriotic songs, the Wright brothers for aviation, Lincoln Ellsworth for exploration, and Major Walter Reed for medicine.\n\nThe report also discusses the legislative process for creating these medals. It mentions that there are no permanent statutory provisions for Congressional Gold Medals, and that each medal is created through ad hoc legislative actions. The process varies between the House and Senate, with the House having no specific rules, while the Senate has a rule requiring 67 cosponsors for consideration. The report also notes that there's no statutory limit on the number of medals that can be issued in a year, and that some bills have been introduced with specific design elements.\n\nAdditionally, the report talks about the advisory bodies involved in the design process, such as the Citizens Coinage Advisory Commission (CC", "answers": ["Senators and Representatives are frequently asked to support or sponsor proposals recognizing historic events and outstanding achievements by individuals or institutions. Among the various forms of recognition that Congress bestows, the Congressional Gold Medal is often considered the most distinguished. Through this venerable tradition—the occasional commissioning of individually struck gold medals in its name—Congress has expressed public gratitude on behalf of the nation for distinguished contributions for more than two centuries. Since 1776, this award, which initially was bestowed on military leaders, has also been given to such diverse individuals as Sir Winston Churchill and Bob Hope, George Washington and Robert Frost, Joe Louis and Mother Teresa of Calcutta. Congressional gold medal legislation generally has a specific format. Once a gold medal is authorized, it follows a specific process for design, minting, and awarding. This process includes consultation and recommendations by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Commission (CCAC) and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (CFA), pursuant to any statutory instructions, before the Secretary of the Treasury makes the final decision on a gold medal's design. Once the medal has been struck, a ceremony will often be scheduled to formally award the medal to the recipient. In recent years, the number of gold medals awarded has increased, and some have expressed interest in examining the gold medal awarding process. Should Congress want to make such changes, several individual and institutional options might be available. The individual options include decisions made by Members of Congress as to what individual or groups might be honored; potential specification of gold medal design elements; and where gold medals for groups might be housed once the award is made. The institutional options could include House, Senate, or committee rules for the consideration of gold medal legislation and whether statutory standards on the number of gold medals issued per year or per Congress might be established for gold medals."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3411}

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points. \n\nThe report is about Cobra Dane and other radar systems, specifically their roles in ballistic missile defense, space surveillance, and intelligence-gathering. It mentions that Cobra Dane is used by the Department of Defense (DOD) to track incoming missile threats, classify them, and determine if they were intercepted. There's also mention of discrimination capabilities, which help identify warheads when decoys are used. \n\nThe report discusses the locations of these radars, like Cobra Dane at Shemya Island and LRDR at Clear Air Force Station. It notes that the location affects their ability to track missile threats, with Cobra Dane providing earlier tracking of threats from North Korea. The report also mentions that the Air Force and MDA are working on modernizing Cobra Dane, which includes replacing parts of the system. \n\nThere's a part about the Air Force report to Congress in January 2018, which outlined the capabilities of Cobra Dane and LRDR. However, it incorrectly stated that both radars could determine if a missile threat was successfully intercepted. The report clarifies that Cobra Dane doesn't have this capability yet, but it might in the future with software changes by 2025. \n\nThe report also talks about other radar systems like the Pacific Radar and the Space Fence, which could reduce the need for Cobra Dane in the future. The Space Fence is expected to be operational by 2019 and will provide the same space surveillance capabilities as Cobra Dane. However, the Air Force still wants to use Cobra Dane for space surveillance when the Space Fence is operational, as long as it's available for ballistic missile defense. \n\nThere's a section about the operational availability of Cobra Dane. The Air Force reported that Cobra Dane was available 91% of the time over a two-year period, which met the 90% requirement. However, in a more recent two-year period, the availability dropped to 88%, which is below the requirement. The reasons given are scheduled downtime for maintenance and calibration, and one instance of unscheduled downtime due to a hardware failure. \n\nThe report also mentions the funding plans for Cobra Dane's operation and sustainment. The Air Force and MDA are sharing the costs for the radar's operation and three modernization projects. The report includes tables summarizing the funding and the projects. \n\nAdditionally, the report discusses", "answers": ["First fielded in 1976 on Shemya Island in Alaska, the Cobra Dane radar faces growing sustainment challenges that DOD plans to address through modernization projects. Anticipating future needs, DOD began investing in new radar systems that share capabilities with Cobra Dane to support ballistic missile defense and space surveillance, including the LRDR (Alaska), the Space Fence (Marshall Islands), and the Pacific Radar (location to be determined). The conference report accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision that GAO review the Air Force's report to Congress on the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane. This report identifies information included in the Air Force's report and describes additional information that GAO reviewed on (1) the capabilities of the Cobra Dane radar and other planned radars to meet DOD's mission requirements, (2) Cobra Dane's operational availability and the plan to mitigate the effect on those missions when Cobra Dane is not available, and (3) DOD's funding plan and project cost estimates for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane and its site at Shemya Island. GAO reviewed the Air Force report and related documentation, and interviewed relevant officials. In its January 2018 report to Congress, the Air Force reported how the Cobra Dane radar and the Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) have shared and unique capabilities to support ballistic missile defense and space surveillance missions. The report noted that the respective locations of both radar systems affect their ability to provide those capabilities. The Department of Defense (DOD) also has other radar investments—the Pacific Radar and the Space Fence, which, according to DOD officials, may reduce DOD's reliance on Cobra Dane to provide ballistic missile defense and space surveillance capabilities. The Air Force's report to Congress noted that Cobra Dane met its requirement for operational availability, which refers to the percentage of time that the radar is able to meet its missions. GAO found that the Air Force has developed procedures to mitigate risks when Cobra Dane is not available. For example, U.S. Northern Command and Missile Defense Agency (MDA) officials stated that they can mitigate risks when Cobra Dane is not available by using the Sea-Based X-band radar to provide support for ballistic missile defense. The Air Force would face some limitations in its ability to conduct space surveillance if Cobra Dane were not available, as Cobra Dane tracks objects no other radar can track. However, MDA officials noted there are no plans to take Cobra Dane offline long enough to compromise space surveillance. The Air Force and MDA plan to contribute total funding of $278.6 million for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane, according to their fiscal year 2019 budget plans. Specifically, the Air Force and MDA plan to share funding for the operation and maintenance of the Cobra Dane radar and for three modernization projects that make up their sustainment plan for the radar. Further, the Air Force report noted that the Air Force also plans to provide $140 million in funding for the sustainment and maintenance of operational access to Cobra Dane's site at Shemya Island. In addition, GAO found that the Air Force developed a total cost estimate for one project—known as the transmitter group replacement—but not for its other two projects.

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report is about the DEA's role in regulating controlled substances, specifically their disposal. The Disposal Act allows the public to dispose of unused controlled substances through authorized collectors. These collectors can be pharmacies, hospitals, etc. The DEA has regulations for these disposal bins, which include secure locks, proper labeling, and methods to ensure the substances are non-retrievable after destruction. \n\nThe report mentions that as of April 2017, about 2.49% of eligible entities had registered as authorized collectors. Most were pharmacies, followed by hospitals. Participation rates varied by state, with some states having very low rates. North Dakota had the highest participation rate, and the state provided funding for disposal bins. \n\nThe report also discusses the factors affecting participation. Costs are a significant barrier, as installing and maintaining the bins requires initial investment and ongoing expenses. There's also uncertainty about compliance with DEA regulations, especially regarding the non-retrievable standard for destruction. Some stakeholders mentioned that other disposal efforts in their communities, like those by law enforcement, might reduce the need for pharmacies to become authorized collectors.\n\nThe DEA's regulations are detailed, including the requirements for disposal bins, the destruction process, and record-keeping. However, the DEA does not collect data on the usage of these bins, such as the amount of drugs disposed of or the types. This lack of data is a limitation in understanding the program's effectiveness.\n\nThe report also notes that while the availability of disposal bins is higher in urban areas, rural areas have a higher percentage of eligible entities becoming authorized collectors. However, the overall population in rural areas is further from these bins compared to urban areas. \n\nThe DEA has some funding mechanisms, like the extended producer responsibility ordinances, which require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay for certain disposal costs. Additionally, some localities have their own funding for these bins. \n\nThe report highlights that DEA officials do not collect data on the usage of the bins, which makes it difficult to assess the program's impact. Stakeholders also mentioned that some DEA regulations might conflict with state or federal laws, such as transportation regulations. \n\nIn summary, the DEA manages the disposal of controlled substances through authorized collectors, which includes pharmacies and other entities. The program has varying participation rates across states, with some states having higher rates due to funding and other factors.

About half of the people who reported misusing prescription drugs in 2015 received them from a friend or relative. One way to help prevent this kind of diversion and potential misuse is by providing secure and convenient ways to dispose of unused, unneeded, or expired prescription medications. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 authorizes pharmacies and other entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances to also collect unused prescription drugs for disposal. In 2014, DEA finalized regulations for the implementation of the Act, establishing a voluntary process for eligible entities to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs using disposal bins. GAO was asked to review participation among authorized collectors that maintain disposal bins. In this report GAO describes (1) participation rates among entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs and (2) factors that affect participation. GAO analyzed the most currently available DEA data from April 2017 on entities eligible to participate and those participating as authorized collectors. GAO also conducted interviews with DEA officials and a nongeneralizable sample of 11 stakeholder organizations selected to illustrate different types of authorized collectors and long-term care facilities. GAO is not making any recommendations. DEA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. GAO found that about 3 percent of pharmacies and other entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs for disposal have volunteered to do so. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) authorizes these entities to dispose of unused drugs to help reduce their potential misuse. Analysis of DEA data shows that as of April 2017, 2,233 of the 89,550 (2.49 percent) eligible entities—that is, certain entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances—had registered with DEA to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. Most—about 81 percent—of the authorized collectors were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics. GAO also found that participation rates varied by state, though in 44 states less than 5 percent of the state's pharmacies and other eligible entities had registered to become authorized collectors. Stakeholders cited several factors that may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have registered with DEA as authorized collectors of unused drugs. Most notably, stakeholders representing authorized collectors told GAO that because participation is voluntary, the cost associated with maintaining a disposal bin—which includes purchasing and installing the bin according to DEA requirements and paying for the destruction of its contents—is an important factor to weigh against potential benefits.

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report explains that the House has standing rules for considering bills and resolutions. However, to expedite legislation, they can temporarily set aside these rules through a special rule or a motion to suspend the rules. The suspension procedure is used for measures that are broadly supported, allowing them to pass without amendments or extensive debate. Most bills are considered under suspension, which requires a two-thirds vote. The report also provides data from the 114th Congress (2015-2016) on how often suspension was used, the types of measures, sponsors, committee involvement, debate time, and voting outcomes.\n\nThe summary needs to be concise, covering the main points: what the suspension procedure is, how it's used, the data from the 114th Congress, and the outcomes. I should mention the percentage of measures considered under suspension, the types of measures (bills, resolutions), the role of committees, the voting process, and the final legislative status.

As the name suggests, the procedure allows the House to suspend its standing and statutory rules in order to consider broadly supported legislation in an expedited manner. More specifically, the House temporarily sets aside its rules that govern the raising and consideration of measures and assumes a new set of constraints particular to the suspension procedure. The suspension of the rules procedure has several parliamentary advantages: (1) it allows nonprivileged measures to be raised on the House floor without the need for a special rule, (2) it enables the consideration of measures that would otherwise be subject to a point of order, and (3) it streamlines floor action by limiting debate and prohibiting floor amendments. Given these features, as well as the required two-thirds supermajority vote for passage, suspension motions are generally used to process less controversial legislation. In the 114th Congress (2015-2016), measures considered under suspension made up 62% of the bills and resolutions that received floor action in the House (743 out of 1,200 measures). The majority of suspension measures were House bills (83%), followed by Senate bills (11%) and House resolutions (4%). The measures covered a variety of policy areas but most often addressed government operations, such as the designation of federal facilities or amending administrative policies. Most measures that are considered in the House under the suspension procedure are sponsored by a House or Senate majority party member. However, suspension is the most common House procedure used to consider minority-party-sponsored legislation regardless of whether the legislation originated in the House or Senate. In 2015 and 2016, minority-party members sponsored 31% of suspension measures, compared to 9% of legislation subject to different procedures, including privileged business (17 measures), unanimous consent (21 measures), and under the terms of a special rule (one Senate bill). Most suspension measures are referred to at least one House committee before their consideration on the floor. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform (now called the Committee on Oversight and Reform) was the committee of primary jurisdiction for the plurality of suspension measures considered in the 114th Congress. Additional committees—such as Energy and Commerce, Homeland Security, Natural Resources, Foreign Affairs, and Veterans' Affairs—also served as the primary committee for a large number of suspension measures. Suspension motions are debatable for up to 40 minutes. In most cases, only a fraction of that debate time is actually used. In the 114th Congress, the average amount of time spent considering a motion to suspend the rules was 13 minutes and 10 seconds. The House adopted nearly every suspension motion considered in 2015 and 2016. Approval by the House, however, did not guarantee final approval in the 114th Congress. The Senate passed or agreed to 40% of the bills, joint resolutions, and concurrent resolutions initially considered in the House under suspension of the rules, and 276 measures were signed into law.

NCA is responsible for maintaining existing national cemeteries and building new ones to serve veterans and their families. Since 1978, NCA has also provided funding through the Veterans Cemetery Grants Program (Grants Program) to help establish, expand, or improve state and tribal veterans’ cemeteries. The Grants Program requires states and tribal governments to apply to the VA for funding, and any cemetery established, expanded, or improved through VA funding must be maintained and operated in accordance with NCA’s operational standards. NCA has revised its policies to better fulfill its mission to serve and honor veterans, including lowering the threshold for establishing new national cemeteries from 170,000 to 80,000 unserved veterans. This change was based on data showing that state veterans’ cemeteries funded through the Grants Program typically served a maximum of 80,000 veterans within a 75-mile service area. NCA’s plan includes establishing 18 new national cemeteries—comprised of five traditional national cemeteries and 13 urban and rural initiative national cemeteries—and awarding funds for new state veterans’ cemeteries. NCA’s goal is to provide reasonable access to burial options for 95 percent of veterans. However, progress has been limited, with NCA years behind its original schedule for opening new cemeteries. Key challenges include acquiring suitable land for new national cemeteries, estimating the costs associated with establishing new national cemeteries, and using all available data to inform how its Grants Program targets unserved veteran populations. NCA has faced delays in opening some of its planned sites, with some estimated to take years longer than originally planned. The primary factor causing these delays is challenges in acquiring suitable land, including difficulty in finding viable land for development, legal issues related to the acquisitions process, and resistance from the local community. Additionally, NCA’s cost estimates for most of its rural initiative sites have increased significantly, with some sites now costing over 200 percent more than initially estimated.

Key parts of NCA's plan include establishing 13 urban and rural initiative national cemeteries and awarding grant funds to state applicants for establishing new state veterans' cemeteries. NCA has made limited progress in implementing its plan to increase burial access and is years behind its original schedule for opening new cemeteries. For example, NCA has opened only two of its planned urban and rural initiative sites and is behind its original schedule for the other 11 (see fig. below).

As a result, NCA is not well positioned to provide reliable and valid cost estimates to better inform decisions to enhance veterans' cemetery access.

Elections are primarily administered by thousands of state and local systems rather than a single, unified national system. States and localities share responsibility for most election administration duties. Exactly how responsibilities are assigned at the state and local levels varies both between and within states, but there are some general patterns in the distribution of duties. States typically have primary responsibility for making decisions about the rules of elections (policymaking). Localities typically have primary responsibility for conducting elections in accordance with those rules (implementation). Localities, with varying contributions from states, typically also have primary responsibility for paying for the activities and resources required to conduct elections (funding). The structures of the state and local systems that conduct elections also vary between and within states. Common variations include differences related to the leadership of the system, the relationship between local election officials and the state, and the population size and density of the jurisdiction the system serves. The leadership of a state or local election system may be elected or appointed, and both the leaders and the methods used to select them may be partisan, bipartisan, or nonpartisan. State officials may have more or less direct influence over local election officials, and the extent of their influence may be affected by other structural features of the state's election systems, such as the methods used to select local officials. Finally, larger election jurisdictions have different administrative advantages and challenges than smaller ones, and more urban jurisdictions have different advantages and challenges than more rural ones. These differences between jurisdictions may be reflected in structural features of the election systems that serve them, such as how the systems allocate resources and where they find specialized expertise. Understanding the duties and structures of state and local election systems may be relevant to Congress for at least two reasons. First, the way state and local election systems work can affect how well federal action on election administration serves its intended purposes. The effectiveness of federal action depends in part on how it is implemented. How it is implemented can depend, in turn, on how the state and local election systems that implement it work.

{"pred": " The report discusses the progress and challenges in improving safety at highway-rail grade crossings in the United States. Since 1975, there has been a significant reduction in grade-crossing crashes and fatalities, with the number of crashes dropping from 12,126 to 2,117 and fatalities from 917 to 273. However, since 2009, the number of crashes and fatalities has plateaued, with around 2,100 crashes and 250 fatalities annually. These fatalities account for less than one percent of all highway-related fatalities. The decrease in crashes and fatalities occurred as the volume of train and highway traffic generally increased over the years. FRA expects the traffic volumes to continue to increase and has expressed concern that grade-crossing crashes and fatalities may also increase. The Section 130 Program provides funds to state DOTs for the elimination of hazards at grade crossings, with states determining the improvements needed. FHWA oversees the use of federal funds and distributes Section 130 Program funds, which averaged $235 million per year from 2009 to 2018. States can combine funds from multiple years to fund expensive projects. The program requires that at least 50 percent of funds be used for protective devices, such as warning lights and gates. States may also use funds for other safety measures, including pavement markings and road alignment improvements. The report highlights the role of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) in managing grade-crossing safety. FHWA oversees the Section 130 Program and ensures that states use the funds appropriately, while FRA provides safety oversight for both freight and passenger railroads. The report also discusses the challenges states face in implementing and assessing grade-crossing projects, including the difficulty in measuring effectiveness due to the low number of crashes and the need for local funding. The report concludes that while the Section 130 Program has been effective in reducing fatalities at grade crossings, there is a need for further evaluation to determine if the program's requirements are still effective in addressing current and emerging safety issues, such as risky driver behavior. The report also highlights the importance of education and enforcement efforts in improving safety at grade crossings, as well as the potential for new technologies to enhance safety in the future.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report. Let me start by reading through the user's query again to make sure I understand", "answers": ["Crashes at highway-rail grade crossings are one of the leading causes of railroad-related deaths. According to FRA data, in 2017, there were more than 2,100 crashes resulting in 273 fatalities. Since 2009 crashes have occurred at a fairly constant rate. The federal government provides states funding to improve grade-crossing safety through FHWA's Section 130 Program. The persistence of crashes and deaths raises questions about the effectiveness of the federal grade-crossing-safety program. GAO was asked to review federal efforts to improve grade-crossing safety. This report examines: (1) the focus of FRA's grade-crossing-safety research, (2) how states select and implement grade-crossing projects and what data are available from FRA to inform their decisions, and (3) the challenges states reported in implementing and assessing projects and the extent to which FHWA assesses the program's effectiveness. GAO analyzed FRA data; reviewed FRA's, FHWA's, and states' documents; reviewed a study of states' selection of projects; and interviewed FRA and FHWA headquarters and field staff, and officials from a non-generalizable sample of eight states, selected to include a mix in the number of grade crossings and crashes, and geographic diversity. Research sponsored by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has identified driver behavior as the main cause of highway-rail grade crossing crashes and that factors such as train and traffic volume can contribute to the risk of a crash. (See figure.) Over 70 percent of fatal crashes in 2017 occurred at grade crossings with gates. To meet the requirements of the federal grade-crossing program, states are responsible for selecting and ensuring the implementation of grade-crossing improvement projects. Most state DOT officials and other relevant transportation officials use local knowledge of grade crossings to supplement the results of models that rank grade crossings based on the risk of an accident. These states generally consider the same primary risk factors, such as vehicle and train traffic. FRA is taking steps to improve the data used in its model to help states assess risk factors at grade crossings. For example, FRA's grade-crossing inspectors will review and identify issues with railroad- and state-reported inventory data. FRA is currently developing guidelines, which it plans to finalize by the end of 2018, to implement these inspections as it has for other types of FRA inspections. Officials we spoke with in eight states reported challenges in pursuing certain types of projects that could further enhance safety, in part because of federal requirements. While safety has improved, many crashes occur at grade crossings with gates, and officials said there could be additional ways to focus program requirements to continue improving safety. States' and the Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) reporting focuses on the program's funding and activity, such as the number and types of projects, yet the low number of crashes makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of projects in reducing crashes and fatalities. FHWA reports the program has been effective in reducing fatalities by about 74 percent since 1975. However, since 2009, annually there have been about 250 fatalities—almost one percent of total highway fatalities. FRA expects future crashes to grow, in part, due to the anticipated increase in rail and highway traffic. An evaluation of the program should consider whether its funding and other requirements allow states to adequately address ongoing safety issues. FHWA officials said they are not required to perform such evaluations. GAO has previously reported on the importance of program evaluations to determine the extent to which a program is meeting its objectives. An evaluation of the program could lead FHWA to identify changes that could allow states to more strategically address problem areas. GAO recommends that FHWA evaluate the program's requirements to determine if they allow states the flexibility to address ongoing safety issues. The Department of Transportation concurred with GAO's recommendation."], "all_classes": null, "length": 7675}

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report discusses how the eligibility criteria for the Purple Heart have changed over time, especially in response to new military situations and debates. It mentions that the Purple Heart was originally created by George Washington in 1782 as the Badge of Military Merit. However, it fell out of use until 1932 when General Douglas MacArthur revived it, renaming it the Purple Heart. The report also talks about the expansion of eligibility, such as including traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as terrorist attacks. There's a mention of the 2015 NDAA expanding eligibility to include attacks by foreign terrorist organizations, which led to the awarding of Purple Hearts to victims of the Fort Hood and Little Rock shootings. The report also covers the debate over whether mental health conditions should be considered for the Purple Heart, with some veterans groups opposing this. There's a part about the Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2015, which expanded eligibility. The report also includes a timeline of changes in Purple Heart eligibility, from 1782 to the present. There's a mention of legislation like H.R. 7097 and H.R. 6234, which were introduced to address issues related to Purple Heart eligibility and the sale of the medal. The report also discusses the current criteria for awarding the Purple Heart, including various conditions such as combat, terrorist attacks, and peacekeeping operations. There's a section about the debate over whether mental health conditions like PTSD should be considered for the Purple Heart, with some arguing that it's necessary to reduce stigma and others opposing it. The report also includes information about the history of the Purple Heart, its revival, and the various legislative changes over the years. There's a mention of the Purple Heart Family Equity Act of 2007, which allows associate membership for spouses and siblings of recipients. The report also covers recent events, like the 2015 Chattanooga shooting, which led to the awarding of Purple Hearts. There's a part about the Airman's Medal and the Soldier's Medal, which were awarded to individuals involved in the 2015 train incident.

The conflicts 2001 to the present have greatly increased the number of Purple Hearts awarded to servicemembers. Events over the past few years have spurred debate on the eligibility criteria for the Purple Heart. Shootings on U.S. soil and medical conditions such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have prompted changes to the eligibility requirements for the Purple Heart. Some critics believe that these changes may lessen the value of the medal and the sacrifices of past recipients on the battlefield. In the past, efforts to modify the Purple Heart's eligibility requirements were contentious, and veterans groups were vocal concerning eligibility changes. While medal requirements are often left to the military and executive branch to decide, Congress is involved in Purple Heart eligibility, utilizing its constitutional power \"To Make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces\" (U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8, clause 14). The Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (P.L. 113-291) included language that expands eligibility for the Purple Heart. Previous debates have raised several questions about the Purple Heart. In some respects, how an event is defined can determine eligibility: Is a servicemember the victim of a crime or a terrorist attack? Conversely, arguing that killed or wounded servicemembers \"should\" be eligible for the Purple Heart can redefine an event: Is the servicemember an advisor to a foreign military or a combatant? Are PTSD and other mental health conditions adequate injuries to warrant the Purple Heart? These are questions that Congress might consider if it chooses to act on this issue."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4754}

Key aspects include the administration of benefits through EBT cards, work requirements for SNAP recipients, and the role of SNAP E&T (Employment and Training) programs in helping participants meet these requirements. The report also discusses the challenges and efforts to address issues such as improper payments, fraud, and trafficking by both recipients and retailers. It highlights the changes in state approaches to SNAP E&T programs, including a shift from mandatory to voluntary programs, and the increasing focus on serving ABAWDs (able-bodied adults without dependents) as certain waivers expire. The report notes a decline in SNAP E&T participation over the years, attributed to states moving to voluntary programs and the associated administrative burdens. Additionally, the report discusses the efforts of FNS to improve program integrity through enhanced federal support, technical assistance, and the development of new guidance and tools for detecting fraud and trafficking. The report also touches on the challenges faced by states in addressing fraud, including staffing levels, data collection, and reporting consistency. It highlights the importance of data analytics in identifying potential fraud and the ongoing efforts by FNS to refine these methods. The report concludes with a discussion of the challenges in estimating the extent of retailer trafficking and the need for further research to address these limitations.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report about the SNAP program. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report is from the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) and discusses their role in managing the SNAP program. It outlines the responsibilities of both the federal government and state agencies. The main points seem to be about the work requirements for SNAP recipients, the different types of SNAP E&T programs, the issues with improper payments and fraud, and the changes in state approaches to these programs over time.\n\nFirst, the structure of SNAP: FNS is responsible for regulations, ensuring state compliance, authorizing retailers. States handle eligibility, benefit calculation, issuing EBT cards, and investigating violations. \n\nWork requirements: Most recipients aged 16-59 must comply with work requirements unless exempt. Exemptions include being physically unfit, caring for a dependent, working 30+ hours, or being a student. ABAWDs (able-bodied adults without dependents) have additional requirements, like working 20 hours or participating", "answers": ["SNAP is the largest federally funded nutrition assistance program. In fiscal year 2017, it provided about $63 billion in benefits. USDA and the states jointly administer SNAP and partner to address issues that affect program integrity, including improper payments and fraud. GAO has previously reported on various aspects of SNAP, including state SNAP E&T programs, improper payment rates, recipient fraud, and retailer trafficking. This testimony discusses GAO's prior and ongoing work on (1) SNAP E&T programs, including program participants, design, and USDA oversight, and (2) USDA's efforts to address SNAP program integrity, including improper payments, as well as recipient and retailer fraud. As part of its ongoing work on SNAP E&T programs, GAO analyzed E&T expenditures and participation data from fiscal years 2007 through 2016, the most recent data available; reviewed relevant research from USDA; and interviewed USDA and selected state and local officials. The prior work discussed in this testimony is based on four GAO products on E&T programs (GAO-03-388), improper payments (GAO-16-708T), recipient fraud (GAO-14-641), and retailer trafficking (GAO-07-53). Information on the scope and methodology of our prior work is available in each product. Overseen by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and administered by states, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Employment and Training (E&T) programs served about 0.5 percent of the approximately 43.5 million SNAP recipients in an average month of fiscal year 2016, according to the most recent USDA data available. These programs are generally designed to help SNAP recipients increase their ability to obtain regular employment through services such as job search and training. Some recipients may be required to participate. According to USDA, about 14 percent of SNAP recipients were subject to work requirements in an average month of fiscal year 2016, while others, such as children and the elderly, were generally exempt from these requirements. States have flexibility in how they design their E&T programs. Over the last several years, states have 1) increasingly moved away from programs that mandate participation, 2) focused on serving able-bodied adults without dependents whose benefits are generally time-limited unless they comply with work requirements, and 3) partnered with state and local organizations to deliver services. USDA has taken steps to increase support and oversight of SNAP E&T since 2014, including collecting new data on participant outcomes from states. GAO has ongoing work reviewing SNAP E&T programs, including USDA oversight. USDA and the states partner to address issues that affect program integrity, including improper payments and fraud, and USDA has taken some steps to address challenges in these areas, but issues remain. Improper Payments. In 2016, GAO reviewed SNAP improper payment rates and found that states' adoption of program flexibilities and changes in federal SNAP policy in the previous decade, as well as improper payment rate calculation methods, likely affected these rates. Although USDA reported improper payment estimates for SNAP in previous years, USDA did not report an estimate for benefits paid in fiscal years 2015 or 2016 due to data quality issues in some states. USDA has since been working with the states to improve improper payment estimates for the fiscal year 2017 review. Recipient Fraud. In 2014, GAO made recommendations to USDA to address challenges states faced in combatting recipient fraud. For example, GAO found that USDA's guidance on the use of transaction data to uncover potential trafficking lacked specificity and recommended USDA develop additional guidance. Since then, USDA has provided technical assistance to some states, including on the use of data analytics. GAO has ongoing work reviewing states' use of data analytics to identify SNAP recipient fraud. Retailer Trafficking. In 2006, GAO identified several ways in which SNAP was vulnerable to retailer trafficking—a practice involving the exchange of benefits for cash or non-food items. For example, USDA had not conducted analyses to identify high-risk retailers and target its resources. Since then, USDA has established risk levels for retailers based on various factors. GAO has ongoing work assessing how USDA prevents, detects, and responds to retailer trafficking and reviewing the usefulness of USDA's estimates of the extent of SNAP retailer trafficking.

{"pred": " The report discusses the growing interest in liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a maritime fuel, driven by the need for less polluting fuels in international shipping and the availability of LNG supplies. While LNG has been used as a secondary fuel in tanker ships for decades, its use as a primary fuel is a newer development, with the first LNG-powered vessel—a Norwegian ferry—beginning service in 2000. The report highlights several potential benefits of LNG as a maritime fuel, including the reduction of harmful air emissions, the creation of a new market for domestic natural gas, and the potential for economic opportunities in domestic shipbuilding. However, the report also notes that the use of LNG as a primary fuel presents challenges, including the need for specialized vessels and land-based infrastructure for LNG \"bunkering\" (vessel refueling) as well as appropriate regulatory oversight of the associated shipping and fueling operations. The storage, delivery, and use of LNG in shipping also have safety implications. These and other aspects of LNG bunkering may become legislative or oversight issues for Congress. The report also discusses the International Maritime Organization (IMO) standards limiting the maximum sulfur content in shipping fuels, the market conditions in which LNG may compete to become a common bunker fuel for vessel operators, and the current status of LNG bunkering globally and in the United States. The report also discusses the potential economic opportunities for the United States in the LNG bunkering market, including the possibility of increased demand for U.S. natural gas production, transportation, and liquefaction. The report also notes that the adoption of LNG as a bunker fuel may be influenced by various factors, including the prices of natural gas and fuel oil, the availability of LNG bunkering infrastructure, and the regulatory environment. The report concludes that while LNG bunkering presents opportunities for the United States, it also poses challenges that may require further consideration and action by Congress and other stakeholders.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report.

The use of LNG as an engine (\"bunker\") fuel in shipping is also drawing attention from federal agencies and is beginning to emerge as an issue of interest in Congress. In 2008, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) announced a timeline to reduce the maximum sulfur content in vessel fuels to 0.5% by January 1, 2020. Annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships requires vessels to either use fuels containing less than 0.5% sulfur or install exhaust-cleaning systems (\"scrubbers\") to limit a vessel's airborne emissions of sulfur oxides to an equivalent level. An option for vessel operators to meet the IMO 2020 standards is to install LNG-fueled engines, which emit only trace amounts of sulfur. Adopting LNG engines requires more investment than installing scrubbers, but LNG-fueled engines may offset their capital costs with operating cost advantages over conventional fuels. Savings would depend on the price spread between LNG and fuel oil. Recent trends suggest that LNG may be cheaper in the long run than conventional fuels. LNG bunkering requires specialized infrastructure for supply, storage, and delivery to vessels. To date, the number of ports worldwide that have developed such infrastructure is limited, although growth in this area has accelerated. Early adoption of LNG bunkering is occurring in Europe where the European Union requires a core network of ports to provide LNG bunkering by 2030. LNG bunkering is also advancing in Asia, led by Singapore, the world's largest bunkering port. Asian countries, together with Australia and the United Arab Emirates, have about 10 coastal ports offering LNG bunkering, with another 15 projects in development. LNG bunkering in the United States currently takes place in Jacksonville, FL, and Port Fourchon, LA—with a third facility under development in Tacoma, WA. Bunkering of LNG-fueled cruise ships using barges also is planned for Port Canaveral, FL. The relative locations of other U.S. ports and operating LNG terminals suggest that LNG bunkering could be within reach of every port along the Eastern Seaboard and in the Gulf of Mexico. On the West Coast, the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, CA, are near the Costa Azul LNG terminal in Ensenada, MX. Seattle and Tacoma are adjacent to the proposed Tacoma LNG project. Since 2015, Jones Act coastal ship operators have taken steps to transition their fleets to use cleaner burning fuels, including LNG. Shippers of dry goods to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico have taken delivery or have ordered LNG-fueled and LNG-capable vessels from U.S. shipyards in Philadelphia, PA, and Brownsville, TX. Another company operates five LNG-powered offshore supply vessels built in Gulfport, MS. Depending upon LNG conversions, the global LNG bunker fuel market could grow to several billion dollars by 2030. If U.S. LNG producers were to supply a significant share of this market—on the strength of comparatively low LNG production costs—LNG bunkering could increase demand for U.S. natural gas production, transportation, and liquefaction. Opportunities in LNG-related shipbuilding might be more limited, as most shipbuilding occurs overseas, although domestically-constructed LNG bunkering barges could be one area of economic growth. Finally, engineering and construction firms could benefit from new opportunities to develop port infrastructure for LNG storage and transfer. However, while vessel conversion to LNG fuel may increase demand for U.S.-produced natural gas, it partially could be offset by reduced demand for U.S.-produced crude oil or refined products. Furthermore, while LNG can reduce direct emissions from vessels, fugitive emissions and environmental impacts from natural gas production and transportation could reduce overall emissions benefits. While the LNG industry has experienced few accidents, the Coast Guard has been developing new standards to address unique safety and security risks associated with LNG in vessel operations. The overarching consideration about LNG bunkering in the United States is uncertainty about how the global shipping fleet will adapt to the IMO sulfur standards over time. This uncertainty complicates decisions related to both private investment and public policy. Although Congress has limited ability to influence global shipping, it could influence the growth of LNG bunkering through the tax code and regulation, or through policies affecting the LNG industry or domestic shipping industry as a whole. Evaluating the potential implications of LNG bunkering within the context of broader energy and environmental policies may become an additional consideration for Congress. If LNG bunkering expands significantly, Congress also may examine the adequacy of existing measures to ensure the safety and security of LNG vessels, storage, and related facilities."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8129}

It also outlines the different approaches that school districts take to test for lead in drinking water, including the use of different action levels to determine when remedial actions are needed. The report also highlights the importance of federal agencies providing guidance and support to states and school districts in their efforts to test for and remediate lead in school drinking water. It discusses the various state requirements and support mechanisms, including funding and technical assistance. The report also highlights the need for clearer guidance on action levels and other key topics to help school districts make informed decisions regarding lead testing and remediation. It emphasizes the importance of addressing lead contamination in school drinking water to protect children from potential adverse health outcomes. The report also discusses the various federal agencies' roles in supporting state and school district efforts to test for and remediate lead in school drinking water, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Department of Education (Education). The report concludes with recommendations for improving federal support and guidance to school districts in their efforts to test for and remediate lead in school drinking water. These recommendations include promoting further efforts to communicate the importance of testing for lead in school drinking water, providing interim or updated guidance to help schools choose an action level for lead remediation, and considering developing a health-based level for schools that incorporates available scientific modeling regarding vulnerable population exposures. The report also highlights the need for federal agencies to improve their collaboration with state and local agencies to support school districts in their efforts to test for and remediate lead in school drinking water.

Lead can leach into water from plumbing materials inside a school. The discovery of toxic levels of lead in water in Flint, Michigan, in 2015 has renewed awareness about the danger lead exposure poses to public health, especially for children. GAO was asked to review school practices for lead testing and remediation. This report examines the extent to which (1) school districts are testing for, finding, and remediating lead in drinking water; (2) states are supporting these efforts; and (3) federal agencies are supporting state and school district efforts. GAO administered a web-based survey to a stratified, random sample of 549 school districts, the results of which are generalizable to all school districts. GAO visited or interviewed officials with 17 school districts with experience in lead testing, spread among 5 states, selected for geographic variation. GAO also interviewed federal and state officials and reviewed relevant laws and documents. An estimated 43 percent of school districts, serving 35 million students, tested for lead in school drinking water in 2016 or 2017, according to GAO's nationwide survey of school districts. An estimated 41 percent of school districts, serving 12 million students, had not tested for lead. GAO's survey showed that, among school districts that did test, an estimated 37 percent found elevated lead (lead at levels above their selected threshold for taking remedial action.) (See figure.) All school districts that found elevated lead in drinking water reported taking steps to reduce or eliminate exposure to lead, including replacing water fountains, installing filters or new fixtures, or providing bottled water. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), at least 8 states have requirements that schools test for lead in drinking water as of 2017, and at least 13 additional states supported school districts' voluntary efforts with funding or in-kind support for testing and remediation. In addition, the five states GAO visited provided examples of technical assistance to support testing in schools. EPA provides guidance and other resources to states and school districts regarding testing and remediating lead in drinking water, and the Department of Education (Education) provides some of this information on its websites. School district officials that used EPA's written guidance said they generally found it helpful. Although EPA guidance emphasizes the importance of addressing elevated lead levels, GAO found that some aspects of the guidance, such as the threshold for taking remedial action, were potentially misleading and unclear, which can put school districts at risk of making uninformed decisions. In addition, many school districts reported a lack of familiarity with EPA's guidance, and their familiarity varied by region of the country. Education and EPA do not regularly collaborate to support state and school district efforts on lead in drinking water, despite agreeing to do so in a 2005 memorandum of understanding. Such collaboration could encourage testing and ensure that more school districts will have the necessary information to limit student and staff exposure to lead.

Under certain circumstances, DOD can enter into an other transaction (OT) agreement instead of a traditional contract. OT agreements are generally exempt from federal procurement laws and regulations. These exemptions grant government officials the flexibility to include, amend, or exclude contract clauses and requirements that are mandatory in traditional procurements (e.g., termination clauses, cost accounting standards, payments, audit requirements, intellectual property, and contract disputes). OT authorities also grant more flexibility to structure agreements in numerous ways, including joint ventures; partnerships; consortia; or multiple agencies joining together to fund an agreement encompassing multiple providers. Other transaction agreements are legally binding contracts; they are referred to as agreements to distinguish them from the traditional procurement contracts governed by the FAR and procurements laws. Other transaction authorities are set forth in two sections of law: 10 U.S.C. 2371—granting authority to use OTs for basic, applied, and advanced research projects. 10 U.S.C. 2371b—granting authority to use OTs for prototype projects and follow-on production. Under this authority, a prototype project can only be conducted if at least one nontraditional defense contractor significantly participates in the project; all significant participants are small businesses or nontraditional defense contractors; at least one-third of the total cost of the prototype project is provided by nongovernment participants; or the senior procurement acquisition official provides a written justification for using an OT. Follow-on production can only be conducted when the underlying prototype OT was competitively awarded, and the prototype project was successfully completed. OTs have the potential to provide significant benefits to DOD, including attracting nontraditional contractors with promising technological capabilities to work with DOD, establishing a mechanism to pool resources with other entities to facilitate development of, and obtain, state-of-the-art dual-use technologies, and offering a unique mechanism for DOD to invest in, and influence the direction of, technology development. A number of analysts warn that along with the potential benefits come significant risks, including potentially diminished oversight and exemption from laws and regulations designed to protect government and taxpayer interests. In FY2017, DOD obligated $2.1 billion on prototype OT agreements, representing less than 1% of contract obligations for the year. However, the use of OTs is expected to grow at a rapid pace, due in part to recent statutory changes expanding other transaction authorities. A number of analysts and officials have raised concerns that if DOD uses OTs in ways not intended by Congress—or is perceived to abuse the authority—Congress could clamp down on the authority.

The report concludes that the current legal landscape governing data protection in the United States is complex and highly technical, but so", "answers": ["Recent high-profile data breaches and other concerns about how third parties protect the privacy of individuals in the digital age have raised national concerns over legal protections of Americans' electronic data. Intentional intrusions into government and private computer networks and inadequate corporate privacy and cybersecurity practices have exposed the personal information of millions of Americans to unwanted recipients. At the same time, internet connectivity has increased and varied in form in recent years. Americans now transmit their personal data on the internet at an exponentially higher rate than in the past, and their data are collected, cultivated, and maintained by a growing number of both \"consumer facing\" and \"behind the scenes\" actors such as data brokers. As a consequence, the privacy, cybersecurity and protection of personal data have emerged as a major issue for congressional consideration. Despite the rise in interest in data protection, the legislative paradigms governing cybersecurity and data privacy are complex and technical, and lack uniformity at the federal level. The constitutional \"right to privacy\" developed over the course of the 20th century, but this right generally guards only against government intrusions and does little to shield the average internet user from private actors. At the federal statutory level, there are a number of statutes that protect individuals' personal data or concern cybersecurity, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, and others. And a number of different agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), enforce these laws. But these statutes primarily regulate certain industries and subcategories of data. The FTC fills in some of the statutory gaps by enforcing a broad prohibition against unfair and deceptive data protection practices. But no single federal law comprehensively regulates the collection and use of consumers' personal data. Seeking a more fulsome data protection system, some governments—such as California and the European Union (EU)—have recently enacted privacy laws regulating nearly all forms of personal data within their jurisdictional reach. Some argue that Congress should consider creating similar protections in federal law, but others have criticized the EU and California approaches as being overly prescriptive and burdensome. Should the 116th Congress consider a comprehensive federal data protection law, its legislative proposals may involve numerous decision points and legal considerations. Points of consideration may include the conceptual framework of the law (i.e., whether it is prescriptive or outcome-based), the scope of the law and its definition of protected information, and the role of the FTC or other federal enforcement agency. Further, if Congress wants to allow individuals to enforce data protection laws and seek remedies for the violations of such laws in court, it must account for standing requirements in Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution. Federal preemption also raises complex legal questions—not only of whether to preempt state law, but what form of preemption Congress should employ. Finally, from a First Amendment perspective, Supreme Court jurisprudence suggests that while some privacy, cybersecurity, or data security regulations are permissible, any federal law that restricts protected speech, particularly if it targets specific speakers or content, may be subject to more stringent review by a reviewing court."], "all_classes": null, "length": 18048}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is about the reliability of the Census Bureau's cost estimate for the 2020 Census. \n\nFirst, the report mentions that a reliable cost estimate is crucial for budgeting and planning. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requires programs to maintain current and well-documented cost estimates that cover the full life-cycle of the program. Without reliable estimates, agencies risk cost overruns, missed deadlines, and performance shortfalls.\n\nThe report outlines four characteristics that a reliable cost estimate must meet: comprehensive, well-documented, accurate, and credible. Each of these has specific criteria. For example, comprehensive means the estimate includes all cost elements without omission or double-counting, and it's based on a work breakdown structure (WBS). Well-documented requires detailed documentation of calculations, sources, and methods, with the ability to trace back to original data. Accuracy means the estimate is unbiased and based on most likely costs, with few mathematical errors. Credible means the estimate discusses limitations due to uncertainty or bias, performs sensitivity analysis, and includes an independent cost estimate (ICE) to check results.\n\nThe report then discusses the Bureau's past cost estimates. In 2008, the Bureau's 2010 Census cost estimate was found to be unreliable due to lack of documentation and not meeting the criteria for comprehensive, accurate, or credible. The Bureau had agreed to improve its cost estimation methods, but there were still issues. In 2012, the Bureau had not yet established guidance for developing cost estimates, and the report recommended that they finalize their guidance. The Bureau agreed with the theme but didn't comment on the recommendation. However, during the review, the Bureau took steps to address the recommendation, which is discussed later in the report.\n\nIn 2016, the report found that the October 2015 version of the Bureau's life-cycle cost estimate for the 2020 Census was not reliable. It partially met two characteristics (comprehensive and accurate) and minimally met the other two (well-documented and credible). The Bureau agreed with the recommendation and took steps to improve the reliability of its cost estimate, which is discussed later in the report. Consequently, an unreliable life-cycle cost estimate is one of the reasons the 2020 Census was designated a GAO High-Risk Area", "answers": ["In October 2017, the Department of Commerce (Commerce) announced that the projected life-cycle cost of the 2020 Census had climbed to $15.6 billion, a more than $3 billion (27 percent) increase over its 2015 estimate. A high-quality, reliable cost estimate is a key tool for budgeting, planning, and managing the 2020 Census. Without this capability, the Bureau is at risk of experiencing program cost overruns, missed deadlines, and performance shortfalls. GAO was asked to evaluate the reliability of the Bureau's life-cycle cost estimate. This report evaluates the reliability of the Bureau's revised life-cycle cost estimate for the 2020 Census and the extent to which the Bureau is using it as a management tool, and compares the 2015 and 2017 cost estimates to describe key drivers of cost growth. GAO reviewed documentary and testimonial evidence from Bureau officials responsible for developing the 2020 Census cost estimate and used its cost assessment guide ( GAO-09-3SP ) as criteria. Since 2015, the Census Bureau (Bureau) has made significant progress in improving its ability to develop a reliable cost estimate. While improvements have been made, the Bureau's October 2017 cost estimate for the 2020 Census does not fully reflect all the characteristics of a reliable estimate. (See figure.) Specifically, for the characteristic of being well-documented, GAO found that some of the source data either did not support the information described in the cost estimate or was not in the files provided for two of its largest field operations. In GAO's assessment of the 2015 version of the 2020 Census cost estimate, GAO recommended that the Bureau take steps to ensure that each of the characteristics of a reliable cost estimate is met. The Bureau agreed and has taken steps, but has not fully implemented this recommendation. A reliable cost estimate serves as a tool for program development and oversight, helping management make informed decisions. During this review, GAO found the Bureau used the cost estimate to inform decision making. Factors that contributed to cost fluctuations between the 2015 and 2017 cost estimates include: Changes in assumptions. Among other changes, a decrease in the assumed rate for self-response from 63.5 percent in 2015 to 60.5 percent in 2017 increased the cost of collecting responses from nonresponding housing units. Improved ability to anticipate and quantify risk. In general, contingency allocations designed to address the effects of potential risks increased overall from $1.3 billion in 2015 to $2.6 billion in 2017. An overall increase in information technology (IT) costs. IT cost increases, totaling $1.59 billion, represented almost 50 percent of the total cost increase from 2015 to 2017. GAO is not making any new recommendations but maintains its earlier recommendation—that the Secretary of Commerce direct the Bureau to take specific steps to ensure its cost estimate meets the characteristics of a high-quality estimate. In its response to this report, Commerce generally agreed with the findings related to cost estimation improvements, but disagreed that the cost estimate was not reliable. However, until GAO's recommendation is fully implemented the cost estimate cannot be considered reliable."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6712}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this detailed report about congressional pay. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report starts by mentioning the Constitution's Article I, Section 6, which states that Congress members' pay is determined by law and comes from the U.S. Treasury. Then there's the Twenty-Seventh Amendment, which says that any law changing their pay won't take effect until after a Representatives election. This amendment was proposed in 1789 but wasn't ratified until 1992. \n\nThe report then discusses the current salary structure. Since FY1983, Congress members have been paid from a permanent appropriations account. The most recent pay adjustment was in 2009, setting the salary at $174,000 for most members, with exceptions like the Speaker and leaders. The report also mentions historical data on pay since 1789, details on legislation that prohibits automatic pay adjustments, and comparisons between projected and actual adjustments based on the Employment Cost Index (ECI). \n\nThere are several methods for adjusting pay. Before 1968, specific legislation was used. Then, there was a method based on recommendations from the President, who used a salary commission. The Ethics Reform Act of 1989 changed the method to use the ECI formula, which automatically adjusts pay unless Congress acts. \n\nThe report also talks about how pay adjustments are determined. Before 1989, the pay was tied to the annual comparability increases for GS employees. The Ethics Reform Act changed this to use the ECI formula. The annual adjustment is automatic unless Congress prohibits it, or the GS adjustment is lower. \n\nThe report includes historical tables on pay since 1992, details on enacted legislation that prohibits automatic pay adjustments, and comparisons between projected and actual adjustments. It also references other CRS reports on pay, benefits, and allowances for Congress members. \n\nThe report explains that there are three ways to adjust pay: specific legislation, presidential recommendations, and annual adjustments based on the ECI. The annual adjustments are limited by the GS base pay increase. The report also discusses how legislation in appropriations bills can prohibit these adjustments, and how this has been done in various years, leading to freezes or limitations on pay. \n\nThere's a mention of the 2019 salary being $174,000, with some exceptions. The report also", "answers": ["Congress is required by Article I, Section 6, of the Constitution to determine its own pay. In the past, Congress periodically enacted specific legislation to alter its pay; the last time this occurred affected pay in 1991. More recently, pay has been determined pursuant to laws establishing formulas for automatic adjustments. The Ethics Reform Act of 1989 established the current automatic annual adjustment formula, which is based on changes in private sector wages as measured by the Employment Cost Index (ECI). The adjustment is automatic unless denied statutorily, although the percentage may not exceed the percentage base pay increase for General Schedule (GS) employees. Member pay has since been frozen in two ways: (1) directly, through legislation that freezes salaries for Members but not for other federal employees, and (2) indirectly, through broader pay freeze legislation that covers Members and other specified categories of federal employees. Members of Congress last received a pay adjustment in January 2009. At that time, their salary was increased 2.8%, to $174,000. A provision in P.L. 111-8 prohibited any pay adjustment for 2010. Under the pay adjustment formula, Members were originally scheduled to receive an adjustment in January 2010 of 2.1%, although this would have been revised downward automatically to 1.5% to match the GS base pay adjustment. Members next were scheduled to receive a 0.9% pay adjustment in 2011. The pay adjustment was prohibited by P.L. 111-165. Additionally, P.L. 111-322 prevented any adjustment in GS base pay before December 31, 2012. Since the percentage adjustment in Member pay may not exceed the percentage adjustment in the base pay of GS employees, Member pay was also frozen during this period. If not limited by GS pay, Member pay could have been adjusted by 1.3% in 2012. The ECI formula established a maximum potential pay adjustment in January 2013 of 1.1%. P.L. 112-175 extended the freeze on GS pay rates for the duration of this continuing resolution, which also extended the Member freeze since the percentage adjustment in Member pay may not exceed the percentage adjustment in GS base pay. Subsequently, Member pay for 2013 was further frozen in P.L. 112-240. The maximum potential 2014 pay adjustment of 1.2%, or $2,100, was denied by P.L. 113-46. The maximum potential January 2015 Member pay adjustment was 1.6%, or $2,800. President Obama proposed a 1.0% increase in the base pay of GS employees, which would automatically have limited any Member pay adjustment to 1.0%. P.L. 113-235 contained a provision prohibiting any Member pay adjustment. The maximum potential January 2016 pay adjustment of 1.7%, or $3,000, would have been limited to 1.0%, or $1,700, due to the GS base pay increase. Member pay for 2016 was frozen by P.L. 114-113. The maximum potential January 2017 pay adjustment of 1.6%, or $2,800, would have been limited to 1.0%, or $1,700, due to the GS base pay increase. Member pay for 2017 was frozen by P.L. 114-254. The maximum potential January 2018 pay adjustment of 1.8%, or $3,100, was automatically limited to 1.4%, or $2,400, before being frozen by P.L. 115-141. The maximum potential January 2019 pay adjustment of 2.3%, or $4,000, was automatically limited to 1.4%, or $2,400, before being frozen at the 2009 level by P.L. 115-244. The maximum potential January 2020 pay adjustment is 2.6%, or $4,500. If Members of Congress had received every adjustment prescribed by the ECI formula since 1992, and the 2 U.S.C. §4501 limitation regarding the percentage base pay increase for GS employees remained unchanged, the 2019 salary would be $210,900. When adjusted for inflation, Member salaries have decreased 15% since the last pay adjustment in 2009. Both the automatic annual adjustments and funding for Members' salaries are provided pursuant to other laws (2 U.S.C. §4501)—not the annual appropriations bills—and a provision prohibiting a scheduled adjustment could be included in any bill, or introduced as a separate bill."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5069}
{"pred": " The Department of Defense (DOD) has established policies to address unwanted sexual behaviors, including sexual assault, sexual harassment, and domestic violence. Sexual assault is defined as intentional sexual contact using force, threats, intimidation, or when the victim does not or cannot consent. Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination involving unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. However, a provision of the NDAA for FY 2017 changed the definition of sexual harassment for the military for purposes of investigations by commanding officers so that it is no longer defined solely as a form of sex discrimination, but is recognized as an adverse behavior on the spectrum of behavior that can contribute to an increase in the incidence of sexual assault. DOD has various offices and organizations that play a role in addressing unwanted sexual behaviors in the military, including the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, who oversees the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO), and the Office of Diversity Management and Equal Opportunity (ODMEO), which manages the military equal opportunity program. SAPRO is responsible for developing the overall policy and guidance for the department’s efforts to prevent and respond to instances of sexual assault, except for criminal investigative policy matters assigned to the DOD Inspector General and legal processes in the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The Secretaries of the military departments are responsible for establishing policies for preventing and responding to sexual assault within their respective military service, and for ensuring compliance with DOD’s policy. Each military service has established an office that is responsible for overseeing and managing the military service’s sexual assault prevention and response program. The Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness has responsibility for developing the overall policy for DOD’s military equal opportunity program and monitoring compliance with the department’s policy. According to the policy, all servicemembers are afforded equal opportunity in an environment free from harassment, including sexual harassment, and unlawful discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including gender), and sexual orientation. The chain of command is used as the primary and preferred channel to (1) identify and correct unlawful discrimination practices, (2) process and resolve complaints of unlawful discrimination or harassment, to include sexual, and (3) ensure that military equal opportunity matters are taken seriously and acted on as necessary. The Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute develops training and studies on equal opportunity. Behaviors under the purview of the military equal opportunity program include unlawful discrimination on the basis of color, national origin,", "answers": ["Unwanted sexual behaviors in the military—including sexual harassment, sexual assault, and domestic violence involving sexual assault—undermine core values, unit cohesion, combat readiness, and public goodwill. Recent studies suggest that these behaviors are part of a “continuum of harm,” which DOD defines as a range of interconnected, inappropriate behaviors that are connected to the occurrence of sexual assault and that support an environment that tolerates these behaviors. Senate Report 114-255 included a provision for GAO to review efforts by DOD to prevent unwanted sexual behaviors in the military. GAO assessed the extent to which DOD has (1) policies on sexual harassment that include CDC principles and relevant legislative elements; (2) processes for maintaining and reporting consistent data on incidents of unwanted sexual behaviors; and (3) overarching efforts, including a prevention strategy, to address unwanted sexual behaviors across the continuum of harm. GAO reviewed DOD policies and pertinent databases, and interviewed agency officials. The Department of Defense's (DOD) policies on sexual harassment include some but not all of the Centers for Disease Control's (CDC) principles for preventing sexual violence and include most relevant legislative elements. GAO identified six principles from CDC's framework for preventing sexual violence, which CDC defines as including sexual harassment. GAO found that Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and military service policies generally include CDC's principles regarding prevention strategies, but none address risk and protective factors, which identify conditions or behaviors that might heighten or lower the risk of sexual harassment victimization or perpetration, respectively. Additionally, a statutory provision in fiscal year 2013 mandated that DOD, among other things, develop a comprehensive sexual harassment policy that includes prevention training, mechanisms for anonymous reporting, and mechanisms for resolving incidents of sexual harassment. OSD and service policies are generally consistent with those required elements except for the inclusion of anonymous reporting. DOD is developing a new department-wide policy that will address sexual harassment, but it is too early to determine how the policy will address these issues. Without policies that include CDC's principles and mechanisms for anonymous reporting, DOD may miss opportunities to address and potentially reduce incidents of unwanted sexual behaviors. Finally, a statutory change in fiscal year 2017 redefined sexual harassment for certain purposes so it is no longer defined solely as a form of sex discrimination but is recognized also as an adverse behavior on the spectrum of behavior that can contribute to an increase in the incidence of sexual assault. While officials indicated a need to update policies, they were unclear on the full implications, if any, of this change. DOD has processes for maintaining and reporting consistent data on incidents of unwanted sexual behaviors including sexual assault and incidents of domestic violence that involve sexual assault, but does not have similar processes for maintaining and reporting data on incidents of sexual harassment. Specifically, DOD uses centralized databases to maintain and report data on incidents of sexual assault and domestic violence that involve sexual assault, but relies on military service-specific databases for information on incidents of sexual harassment. DOD has not established standard data elements and definitions to guide the services in maintaining and reporting data on sexual harassment. Inconsistencies in data elements and definitions generally mean that one service may be maintaining data that is more or less detailed than, or that differs from, the data maintained by other services. Such inconsistencies may create difficulties in reporting department-wide sexual harassment data, since the individual service data must be adapted to fit reporting requirements. DOD has several overarching efforts to address unwanted sexual behaviors across the continuum of harm, including developing an overarching prevention strategy. However, it is unclear whether the strategy under development will contain key elements for long-term and results-oriented strategic planning such as long-term goals, strategies to achieve goals, and metrics to gauge progress. Without incorporating these elements into its overarching prevention strategy, DOD may not be in a position to effectively coordinate and integrate prevention activities and reduce instances of unwanted sexual behaviors. GAO recommends that DOD fully include in its new policy on sexual harassment CDC's principles for sexual violence prevention and mechanisms for anonymous reporting, develop standard data elements and definitions for reporting sexual harassment incidents, and incorporate in its overarching prevention strategy elements key for a long-term, results-oriented strategy.

{"pred": " The U.S. Secret Service, a critical component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is responsible for protecting the President, Vice President, their families, and national leaders, as well as safeguarding the nation’s currency and financial payment systems. As of June 2018, the Secret Service had approximately 7,100 employees, including 190 IT staff, with the majority located in Washington, D.C. The component has faced long-standing challenges in managing its IT infrastructure, including network and system vulnerabilities, outdated mainframe systems, and a lack of modernization efforts. In response, the Secret Service initiated the Information Integration and Technology Transformation (IITT) investment, which aims to modernize and enhance the component’s IT infrastructure, communications systems, applications, and processes. The IITT investment includes two programs (one of which includes three projects) and one standalone project, with capabilities in planning or development and modernization. The Secret Service has taken steps to address these challenges, including hiring a full-time Chief Information Officer (CIO) in November 2015 and consolidating all IT staff and assets under the CIO in March 2017. The CIO has implemented 11 of 14 selected component-level IT oversight responsibilities, including developing and maintaining an IT strategic plan, ensuring IT policies align with DHS directives, and participating in DHS-level councils and boards. However, the CIO has not fully implemented three key responsibilities, including establishing an IT acquisition review process to ensure all IT contracts are reviewed, updating the Secret Service’s enterprise governance policy to reflect the CIO’s role in developing and reviewing the IT budget, and ensuring agile projects measure product quality and post-deployment user satisfaction. The Secret Service has also faced challenges in effectively managing its IT workforce, including a lack of strategic workforce planning, targeted recruitment activities, and comprehensive training programs. The component has partially implemented some workforce planning and management practices, but not all, which has limited its ability to ensure the timely and effective acquisition and maintenance of its IT infrastructure and services. The Secret Service has implemented selected performance and progress monitoring practices for the IITT investment, including monitoring program performance and conducting reviews at predetermined checkpoints or milestones, as well as measuring agile projects on key metrics such as velocity, development progression, product quality, and post-deployment user satisfaction. The report concludes with 13 recommendations to the Director of the Secret Service to address the identified weaknesses, including establishing an IT acquisition review process, updating the enterprise governance policy,", "answers": ["Commonly known for protecting the President, the Secret Service also plays a leading role in investigating and preventing financial and electronic crimes. To accomplish its mission, the Secret Service relies heavily on the use of IT infrastructure and systems. In 2009, the component initiated the IITT investment—a portfolio of programs and projects that are intended to, among other things, improve systems availability and security in support of the component's business operations. GAO was asked to review the Secret Service's oversight of its IT portfolio and workforce. This report discusses the extent to which the (1) CIO implemented selected IT oversight responsibilities, (2) Secret Service implemented leading IT workforce planning and management practices, and (3) Secret Service and DHS implemented selected performance monitoring practices for IITT. GAO assessed agency documentation against 14 selected component CIO responsibilities established in DHS policy; 15 selected leading workforce planning and management practices within 5 topic areas; and two selected leading industry project monitoring practices that, among other things, were, in GAO's professional judgment, of most significance to managing IITT. The U.S. Secret Service (Secret Service) Chief Information Officer (CIO) fully implemented 11 of 14 selected information technology (IT) oversight responsibilities, and partially implemented the remaining 3. The CIO partially implemented the responsibilities to establish a process that ensures the Secret Service reviews IT contracts; ensure that the component's IT policies align with the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) policies; and set incremental targets to monitor program progress. Additional efforts to fully implement these 3 responsibilities will further position the CIO to effectively manage the IT portfolio. Of the 15 selected practices within the 5 workforce planning and management areas, the Secret Service fully implemented 3 practices, partly implemented 8, and did not implement 4 (see table). Within the strategic planning area, the component partly implemented the practice to, among other things, develop IT competency needs. While the Secret Service had defined general core competencies for its workforce, the Office of the CIO (OCIO) did not identify all of the technical competencies needed to support its functions. As a result, the office was limited in its ability to address any IT competency gaps that may exist. Also, while work remains to improve morale across the component, the Secret Service substantially implemented the employee morale practices for its IT staff. Secret Service officials said the gaps in implementing the workforce practices were due to, among other things, their focus on reorganizing the IT workforce within OCIO. Until the Secret Service fully implements these practices for its IT workforce, it may be limited in its ability to ensure the timely and effective acquisition and maintenance of the component's IT infrastructure and services. Of the two selected IT project monitoring practices, DHS and the Secret Service fully implemented the first practice to monitor the performance of the Information Integration and Technology Transformation (IITT) investment. In addition, for the second practice—to monitor projects on incremental development metrics—the Secret Service fully implemented the practice on one of IITT's projects and partially implemented it on another. In particular, OCIO did not fully measure post-deployment user satisfaction with the system on one project. OCIO plans to conduct a user satisfaction survey of the system by September 2018, which should inform the office on whether the system is meeting users' needs.

{"pred": " The report examines the patterns of school discipline in the United States, highlighting disparities in how students of different racial and ethnic backgrounds, genders, and socioeconomic statuses are treated. It identifies implicit bias among teachers and staff as a contributing factor to these disparities, where subjective interpretations of student behavior lead to harsher disciplinary actions against certain groups, particularly Black students and students with disabilities. The report also discusses the impact of external factors such as poverty, trauma, and mental health issues on student behavior, which can lead to increased disciplinary actions. It notes that the types of offenses that Black children are disciplined for are largely based on school officials' interpretations of behavior, with examples such as disobedience and disruptive behavior. A separate study used eye-tracking technology to show that teachers gazed longer at Black boys than other children when asked to look for challenging behavior based on video clips. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) reported that this research has highlighted implicit bias as a contributing factor in school discipline and may shed some light on the persistent disparities in expulsion and suspension practices, even though the study did not find that teacher gazes were indicative of how they would discipline students. Children’s behavior in school may be affected by health and social challenges outside the classroom that tend to be more acute for poor children, including minority children who experience higher rates of poverty. Research shows that experiencing trauma in childhood may lead to educational challenges, such as lower grades and more suspensions and expulsions; increased use of mental health services; and increased involvement with the child welfare and juvenile justice systems, according to HHS’s Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Further, a substantial share of children nationwide are estimated to have experienced at least one trauma, referred to as an adverse childhood experience (ACE), according to the National Survey of Children’s Health. Additionally, as we recently reported, there has been an increase in certain mental health issues within the school age population. For example, from 2005 to 2014, the suicide rate of youth ages 15 to 19 rose slightly, with older youth having a much higher rate of suicide than younger youth, and since 2007, the percentage of youth ages 12-17 experiencing a major depressive episode increased. About 50 million students were enrolled in K-12 public schools during the 2013-14 school year, according to the CRDC. About 90 percent of students attended traditional public schools; the remainder were enrolled", "answers": ["Research has shown that students who experience discipline that removes them from the classroom are more likely to repeat a grade, drop out of school, and become involved in the juvenile justice system. Studies have shown this can result in decreased earning potential and added costs to society, such as incarceration and lost tax revenue. Education and Justice are responsible for enforcing federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination in the administration of discipline in public schools. GAO was asked to review the use of discipline in schools. To provide insight into these issues, this report examines (1) patterns in disciplinary actions among public schools, (2) challenges selected school districts reported with student behavior and how they are approaching school discipline, and (3) actions Education and Justice have taken to identify and address disparities or discrimination in school discipline. GAO analyzed discipline data from nearly all public schools for school year 2013-14 from Education's Civil Rights Data Collection; interviewed federal and state officials, as well as officials from a total of 5 districts and 19 schools in California, Georgia, Massachusetts, North Dakota, and Texas. We selected these districts based on disparities in suspensions for Black students, boys, or students with disabilities, and diversity in size and location. We also reviewed federal laws and a non-generalizable sample of seven recently resolved federal school discipline investigations (selected in part based on the type of alleged discrimination). We incorporated technical comments from the agencies as appropriate. Black students, boys, and students with disabilities were disproportionately disciplined (e.g., suspensions and expulsions) in K-12 public schools, according to GAO's analysis of Department of Education (Education) national civil rights data for school year 2013-14, the most recent available. These disparities were widespread and persisted regardless of the type of disciplinary action, level of school poverty, or type of public school attended. For example, Black students accounted for 15.5 percent of all public school students, but represented about 39 percent of students suspended from school—an overrepresentation of about 23 percentage points (see figure). Officials GAO interviewed in all five school districts in the five states GAO visited reported various challenges with addressing student behavior, and said they were considering new approaches to school discipline. They described a range of issues, some complex—such as the effects of poverty and mental health issues. For example, officials in four school districts described a growing trend of behavioral challenges related to mental health and trauma. While there is no one-size-fits-all solution for the issues that influence student behavior, officials from all five school districts GAO visited were implementing alternatives to disciplinary actions that remove children from the classroom, such as initiatives that promote positive behavioral expectations for students. Education and the Department of Justice (Justice) documented several actions taken to identify and address school discipline issues.

{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1 inch margins)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is about federal land ownership in the U.S., specifically the 640 million acres owned by the federal government, which is more than a quarter of the total land. These lands are concentrated in the western states, including Alaska. The report discusses the four main agencies responsible for managing these lands: the National Park Service (NPS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and the U.S. Forest Service (FS). Each agency has different authorities for acquiring and disposing of land, and the report details these differences.\n\nThe key points are that no single law provides all the authorities, but Congress has enacted various laws over time. The BLM has the broadest authority for both acquisitions and disposals, while the NPS has the most limited. The FS has some authority but not as broad as BLM. The FWS has acquisition authorities but no general disposal. The report also mentions the different purposes of these authorities, such as acquiring land to protect resources or dispose of land for other uses like agriculture. There's a mention of exchanges, which are governed by specific laws, and the BLM and FS have broader exchange authorities under FLPMA. \n\nThe report also discusses the legislative considerations regarding the acquisition and disposal authorities. Congress has considered measures to establish, modify, or eliminate these authorities. For example, some proposals in the 115th Congress would allow states to exchange land grant parcels for federal lands, or authorize the BLM and FS to convey small tracts to adjacent landowners. There are also proposals to amend the Small Tracts Act regarding the type and value of FS lands that can be disposed of and the use of related proceeds. \n\nAdditionally, the report talks about the funding sources for land acquisition, such as the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), which has been a key source but has faced expiration. The report also mentions the role of mandatory spending authorities, like the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund for the FWS. \n\nThe summary needs to be concise, covering the main points: the extent of federal land ownership, the agencies involved, their respective authorities for acquisition and disposal, the legislative considerations, and the funding sources. I should also mention the controversies around federal land ownership and the various proposals to modify", "answers": ["The federal government owns roughly 640 million acres, heavily concentrated in 12 western states. Four agencies—the National Park Service (NPS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the Department of the Interior, and the U.S. Forest Service (FS) in the Department of Agriculture—administer about 95% of those lands. The extent to which each of these four federal agencies have authority to acquire and dispose of land varies considerably. The BLM has relatively broad authority for both acquisitions and disposals under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA). The agency also has other authorities for disposing of land, including two laws that allow the agency to retain the proceeds for subsequent land acquisition, among other purposes, and a law that allows transfers to governmental units and other entities for public purposes. By contrast, the NPS has no general authority to acquire land to create new park units or to dispose of park lands. The FS authority to acquire lands is mostly limited to lands within or contiguous to the boundaries of a national forest. The agency has various authorities to dispose of land, but they are relatively constrained and infrequently used. The FWS has various authorities to acquire lands but no general authority to dispose of its lands. The agency frequently uses acquisition authority under the Migratory Bird Conservation Act of 1929 because of the availability of funding through the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund. The nature of the acquisition and disposal authorities of the four federal agencies also varies. In general, the acquisition authorities are designed to allow the four agencies to bring into federal ownership lands that many contend could benefit from federal management. Disposal authorities generally are designed to allow agencies to convey land that is no longer needed for a federal purpose or that might be chiefly valuable for another purpose. Some of the authorities specify particular circumstances where they can be used, such as the conveyance of FS land for educational purposes and the disposal of BLM land for recreation and public purposes. Congress often faces questions on the adequacy of existing acquisition and disposal authorities; the nature, extent, and location of their use; and the extent of federal land ownership overall. The current acquisition and disposal authorities form the backdrop for consideration of measures to establish, modify, or eliminate authorities, or to provide for the acquisition or disposal of particular lands. In some cases, Congress enacts bills to provide authority to acquire or dispose of particular parcels where no standing authority exists and, in other cases, to direct or facilitate land transactions. Congress also addresses acquisition and disposal policy in the context of debates on the role and goals of the federal government in owning and managing land generally, and it has considered broader measures to dispose of lands or to promote acquisition. Other issues for Congress pertain to the sources and levels of funds for land acquisition. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is the primary source of funding for land acquisition. Congress has considered diverse measures related to the LWCF, such as legislation to make LWCF funding permanent and bills to direct LWCF monies to additional, nonacquisition purposes. Additionally, the FWS has the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund, an account with mandatory spending authority supported by revenue from three sources. The BLM also has mandatory spending authorities that allow the proceeds from land sales to be used for land acquisition, among other purposes."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4882}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this detailed report about the legislative process in the House of Representatives. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points.\n\nThe report starts by explaining that the House has a complex set of rules, precedents, and practices. The official manual is over 1,000 pages, with more volumes coming. However, understanding these procedures isn't as difficult as the size suggests. The first reason is predictability in procedures, even though some rules are complex. The House tends to follow similar procedures under similar circumstances. The second reason is the underlying principle that a majority should be able to prevail without undue delay, which gives coherence to the procedures. The Constitution allows each house to set its own rules, which means the House can amend its rules unilaterally, and members can protect their rights by making points of order. \n\nThe report also discusses the debate limitations, such as the one-hour limit on floor debate. There are exceptions, like 5, 20, or 30 minutes. Also, some bills are considered under \"suspension of the rules,\" which limits debate to 40 minutes and requires a two-thirds vote. The House has procedures to handle the order of business, with certain measures being privileged. \n\nThe report goes into detail about the different modes of consideration, like the suspension of the rules, which allows quick passage with a two-thirds vote. It also explains the role of the Committee of the Whole, where most major bills are debated and amended. The procedures in the Committee of the Whole are more flexible, allowing for more amendments and debate compared to the House itself. \n\nThe report also covers the process of resolving differences between the House and Senate, such as through conference committees. It mentions the importance of special rules reported by the Rules Committee, which can set procedural ground rules for considering a bill. These rules can affect the amendments allowed, such as open, modified open, or closed rules. \n\nThe report also discusses the voting procedures, including voice votes, division votes, and electronic votes. It explains the quorum requirements and how the House ensures a quorum is present when necessary. \n\nAdditionally, the report provides information about the sources of House procedures, such as the House manual, precedents, and other publications. It also lists several CRS reports that provide more detailed information on specific aspects of House procedures. \n\nNow, I need to condense all this information into a one-page summary. I should start", "answers": ["The daily order of business on the floor of the House of Representatives is governed by standing rules that make certain matters and actions privileged for consideration. On a day-to-day basis, however, the House can also decide to grant individual bills privileged access to the floor, using one of several parliamentary mechanisms. The standing rules of the House include several different parliamentary mechanisms that the body may use to act on bills and resolutions. Which of these will be employed in a given instance usually depends on the extent to which Members want to debate and amend the legislation. In general, all of the procedures of the House permit a majority of Members to work their will without excessive delay. The House considers most legislation by motions to suspend the rules, with limited debate and no floor amendments, with the support of at least two-thirds of the Members voting. Occasionally, the House will choose to consider a measure on the floor by the unanimous consent of Members. The Rules Committee is instrumental in recommending procedures for considering major bills and may propose restrictions on the floor amendments that Members can offer or bar them altogether. Many major bills are first considered in Committee of the Whole before being passed by a simple majority vote of the House. The Committee of the Whole is governed by more flexible procedures than the basic rules of the House, under which a majority can vote to pass a bill after only one hour of debate and with no floor amendments. Although a quorum is supposed to be present on the floor when the House is conducting business, the House assumes a quorum is present unless a quorum call or electronically recorded vote demonstrates that it is not. However, the standing rules preclude quorum calls at most times other than when the House is voting. Questions are first decided by voice vote, although any Member may then demand a division vote. Before the final result of a voice or division vote is announced, Members can secure an electronically recorded vote instead if enough Members desire it or if a quorum is not present in the House. The constitutional requirements for making law mean that each chamber must pass the same measure with the identical text before transmitting it to the President for his consideration. When the second chamber of Congress amends a measure sent to it by the first chamber, the two chambers must resolve legislative differences to meet this requirement. This can be accomplished by shuttling the bill back and forth between the House and Senate, with each chamber proposing amendments to the position of the other, or by establishing a conference committee to try to negotiate a compromise version of the legislation."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6694}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) overtime provisions for executive, administrative, and professional employees. Let me start by understanding the key points from the report.\n\nFirst, the report is about frequently asked questions related to the overtime exemptions under the FLSA for EAP employees. It's structured into three sections: an overview of the FLSA and EAP exemptions, applicability of the exemptions, and information on the 2019 proposed rule and the 2016 final rule.\n\nThe FLSA, enacted in 1938, sets minimum wage and overtime pay requirements for most employees, except those exempted. The EAP exemption was added to cover certain white-collar workers. The Secretary of Labor defines these exemptions through regulations. The report mentions that there have been nine rules since 1938.\n\nThe three criteria for exemption are the salary basis test, duties test, and salary level test. Employees must be paid a fixed salary, not on an hourly basis. The duties must align with executive, administrative, or professional roles. The salary must be above a certain threshold, which has been adjusted over time.\n\nThe report also discusses the 2016 final rule, which was invalidated by a court. The 2019 proposed rule is mentioned, which would increase the salary level threshold for EAP exemptions. The current effective threshold is $455 per week, and the proposed rule would raise it to $679 per week. The HCE exemption threshold is also proposed to increase from $100,000 to $147,414 annually.\n\nThe report also covers various aspects like the applicability to nonprofits, institutions of higher education, state and local governments, and the U.S. territories. It mentions that while there are no blanket exemptions for these entities, certain employees might still be covered by the FLSA depending on their duties and compensation.\n\nAdditionally, the report discusses the 2019 proposed rule's changes, such as the salary level threshold, the HCE exemption, and the special salary level for the motion picture industry. It also mentions the potential impact of these changes on the number of employees who would become nonexempt and thus eligible for overtime pay.\n\nThe summary needs to be concise, covering the main points of the report. I should start by introducing the FLSA and the EAP exemptions. Then outline the three criteria", "answers": ["The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), enacted in 1938, is the main federal law that establishes general wage and hour standards for most, but not all, private and public sector employees. Among other protections, the FLSA establishes that covered nonexempt employees must be compensated at one-and-a-half times their regular rate of pay for each hour worked over 40 hours in a workweek. The FLSA also establishes certain exemptions from its general labor market standards. One of the major exemptions to the overtime provisions in the FLSA is for bona fide \"executive, administrative, and professional\" employees (the \"EAP\" or \"white collar\" exemptions). The FLSA grants authority to the Secretary of Labor to define and delimit the EAP exemption \"from time to time.\" To qualify for this exemption from the FLSA's overtime pay requirement, an employee must be salaried (the \"salary basis\" test); perform specified executive, administrative, or professional duties (the \"duties\" test); and earn above an established salary level threshold (the \"salary level\" test). In March 2019, the Secretary of Labor published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to make changes to the EAP exemptions. The 2019 proposed rule would become effective around January 2020. The major changes in the 2019 proposed rule include increasing the standard salary level threshold from the previous level of $455 per week to $679 per week and committing the Department of Labor (DOL) to updating the EAP exemptions every four years through the rulemaking process. The 2019 proposed rule does not change the duties and responsibilities that employees must perform to be exempt. Thus, the 2019 proposed rule would affect EAP employees at salary levels between $455 and $679 per week in 2020. DOL estimates that about 4.9 million workers would be affected in the first year, including about 1.3 million EAP employees who would become newly entitled to overtime pay and an additional 3.6 million workers who would have overtime protection clarified and thereby strengthened.

With the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA; P.L. 115-123, February 9, 2018), which raised discretionary spending limits set by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25), the Administration's FY2019 foreign affairs funding request was entirely within enduring (base) funds; no Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding was included the SFOPS request for the first time since FY2012. The FY2019 request would have represented a 23.3% decrease in SFOPS funding compared with FY2018 actual funding levels. The proposed State and related agency funding would have been 18.7% below FY2018 funding and the foreign operations funding would have been reduced by 25.2%. In the State and related programs budget, cuts were proposed for several accounts, including the diplomatic security accounts, contributions to international organizations, and contributions for international peacekeeping activities. In the foreign operations budget, cuts would have been applied across all accounts, with disproportionately large cuts proposed for humanitarian assistance, multilateral assistance, and funding for bilateral development programs focused on agriculture, education, and democracy promotion. Both the House and Senate appropriations committees approved FY2019 SFOPS bills that included funding at higher levels than the Administration requested and closer to FY2018 funding. H.R. 6385, approved by the House appropriations committee on June 20, 2018, would have funded SFOPS accounts at $54.177 billion. S. 3108, approved by the Senate appropriations committee on June 21, 2018, would have provided $54.602 billion for SFOPS accounts. FY2019 began with seven appropriations bills, including SFOPS, unfinished. Congress and the President approved continuing resolutions to fund the affected federal agencies through December 21, 2018 at the FY2018 level (P.L. 115-245, Division C and P.L. 115-298).

According to the report, as of March 31, 2018, 13 percent of overseas Foreign Service positions were vacant, a rate similar to that reported in 2012 and 2008. The vacancy rate is particularly high in specialist positions, with 14.2 percent of all overseas Foreign Service specialist positions vacant. The report highlights that vacancies in critical positions, such as security officer, information management, and office management, have increased the vulnerability of overseas posts to security threats and cybersecurity attacks. These vacancies also lead to increased workloads for existing staff, which can reduce their ability to perform important functions such as training, fraud prevention, and project implementation. The report notes that vacancies in the political and economic generalist career tracks have a significant impact on the ability of overseas posts to provide comprehensive reporting on political and economic developments, which is essential for informed foreign policy decisions. Additionally, vacancies in specialist positions may heighten security risks and disrupt post operations. The report also finds that State has not developed an integrated action plan to address persistent vacancies in both generalist and specialist positions, despite various efforts to reduce such vacancies. The report concludes that developing an integrated action plan to address persistent vacancies in both generalist and specialist positions is necessary to ensure the Department of State can effectively carry out its mission and achieve U.S. foreign policy goals.\n\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report.

In 2009 and 2012, GAO identified ongoing Foreign Service staffing gaps. GAO was asked to review State's Foreign Service staffing. This report examines (1) vacancies in State's Foreign Service staffing at overseas posts, (2) reported effects of Foreign Service vacancies on diplomatic readiness, and (3) State's efforts to address Foreign Service vacancies. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed State's Global Employment Management System data as of March 2018. The system includes information on Foreign Service and Civil Service positions, including the total number of authorized Foreign Service positions and whether each position is filled or vacant. GAO also reviewed its relevant prior reports and State workforce planning documents. In addition, GAO interviewed State staff at 10 overseas posts, selected on the basis of large numbers of Foreign Service vacancies and diversity in the types of Foreign Service positions that were vacant at these posts, among other factors. The Department of State's (State) data show persistent Foreign Service vacancies at overseas posts since 2008. According to the data, 13 percent of overseas Foreign Service positions were vacant as of March 2018. This percentage is similar to the percentages GAO reported for 2008 and 2012, when 14 percent of these positions were vacant. In addition, State's data show persistent vacancies at overseas posts in generalist positions that help formulate and implement U.S. foreign policy and in specialist positions that support and maintain the functioning of overseas posts. State's data also show persistent Foreign Service vacancies at overseas posts with State's highest foreign policy priorities and in regions with security risks that could threaten U.S. foreign policy interests. According to staff at overseas posts, Foreign Service vacancies adversely affect State's ability to carry out U.S. foreign policy. Staff at overseas posts told us that vacancies increase workloads, contributing to low morale and higher stress for Foreign Service staff and that vacancies in Political and Economic positions—20 percent and 16 percent, respectively—limit the reporting on political and economic issues that posts are able to provide to State headquarters. Notably, officials also stated that vacancies in specialist positions may heighten security risks at overseas posts and disrupt post operations. For instance, some overseas post staff said that vacancies in Information Management positions had increased the vulnerability of posts' computer networks to potential cybersecurity attacks and other malicious threats. State described various efforts—implemented by multiple offices in the department —to help address overseas Foreign Service vacancies, but these efforts are not guided by an integrated action plan to reduce persistent vacancies. An example of State's efforts is the “Hard-to-Fill” program, which allows Civil Service staff an opportunity to fill a Foreign Service vacancy on a single overseas tour. According to GAO's 2017 High-Risk Series report, an agency should design and implement an action plan—integrated across its relevant offices—that defines the root causes of all skills gaps and suggests corrective measures. However, State has not developed such an action plan for reducing persistent overseas Foreign Service vacancies. Without developing an integrated action plan, overseas Foreign Service vacancies may persist. As a result, State's ability to achieve U.S. foreign policy goals and help ensure secure and efficient operations could be adversely impacted.

It highlights the significant changes in the oil and petroleum products markets since the SPR's establishment, including the increase in U.S. domestic crude oil production, the relative stability of consumption, and the growing global nature of these markets. The report also notes that the U.S. is projected to become a net exporter of crude oil and petroleum products by the late 2020s, which would eliminate the 90-day reserve obligation for net exporters. However, the SPR would still need to respond to supply disruptions through releases. The report also discusses the current state of the SPR, including its storage capacity, the infrastructure used for storage and distribution, and the challenges faced in maintaining operational readiness. It notes that the SPR is primarily composed of crude oil, which may not be as effective in responding to disruptions that affect the refining sector. The report also addresses the need for additional regional petroleum product reserves in areas identified as vulnerable to fuel supply disruptions, as recommended by the Quadrennial Energy Review of 2015. However, the Department of Energy has not completed these studies or made the results publicly available. The report further discusses the implications of congressionally mandated oil sales on the SPR's size and configuration, noting that these sales have led to a reduction in the SPR's design capacity and the potential for excess storage capacity. The report also highlights the importance of considering private-sector response to supply disruptions, as well as the need for a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of different SPR sizes. The report concludes with recommendations for the Department of Energy to conduct additional analyses, periodically review the SPR, and consider the potential benefits of regional petroleum product reserves. The SPR is currently managed by the Department of Energy's Office of Petroleum Reserves and is stored in underground salt caverns along the Gulf Coast. The SPR has four storage sites with a design capacity of 713.5 million barrels. However, the report also points out that the SPR's infrastructure is aging, leading to increased maintenance costs and decreased system reliability. The report further discusses the SPR's role in meeting the International Energy Agency (IEA) 90-day reserve obligation, which is based on a country's net imports. The SPR is also used to meet the IEA obligation to release reserves in response to a collective action to address a supply disruption. The report also discusses the SPR's role in the context of the global oil market, where", "answers": ["More than 4 decades ago, Congress authorized the creation of the SPR to reduce the impact of disruptions in supplies of petroleum products. DOE manages the SPR. As a member of the International Energy Agency, the United States is obligated to maintain reserves equivalent to at least 90 days of the previous year's net imports (imports minus exports). The SPR's storage and related infrastructure is aging, and DOE has plans to modernize these facilities. Since 2015, Congress has mandated crude oil sales. As of March 2018, the SPR held about 665 million barrels of crude oil. GAO was asked to examine the SPR's ability to meet U.S. energy security needs. This report examines, among other things, the extent to which (1) DOE has identified the optimal size of the SPR, and (2) DOE's plans for modernizing the SPR take into account the effects of congressionally mandated crude oil sales. GAO reviewed DOE's plans and studies, and interviewed agency officials and nine experts selected based on prior work, referrals, and a literature review. The Department of Energy (DOE) has not identified the optimal size of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). In 2016, DOE completed a long-term strategic review of the SPR after its last comprehensive examination conducted in 2005. The 2016 review examined the benefits of several SPR sizes, but it did not identify an optimal size and its review was limited in several ways. In particular, DOE did not fully consider recent and expected future changes in market conditions, such as the implications of falling net imports, or the role that increased levels of private reserves (reserves held by private companies for their own purposes) may play in responding to supply disruptions. These changes have contributed to SPR and private reserves reaching historically high levels on a net imports basis (see figure). These changes are expected to continue to evolve—according to government projections, the United States will become a net exporter in the late 2020s before again becoming a net importer between 2040 and 2050. GAO has found that agencies should reexamine their programs if conditions change. Without addressing the limitations of its 2016 review and periodically performing reexaminations in the future, DOE cannot be assured that the SPR will be sized appropriately into the future. DOE has taken steps to take into account congressionally mandated sales of SPR crude oil in its $1.4 billion modernization plans for SPR's infrastructure and facilities. The SPR is projected to hold 405 million barrels of oil by the end of fiscal year 2027. However, DOE's current plans are based on information analyzed prior to recently mandated sales. According to DOE officials, the agency began a study in March 2018 to assess the effects of these sales on the SPR's modernization. However, this study is not examining all options for handling any excess SPR assets that may be created by currently mandated sales or any additional sales that may be mandated in the future, inconsistent with an agency order on real property asset management that calls for identifying excess assets. For example, DOE does not plan to examine the potential to lease unused SPR storage capacity to the private sector because DOE is not currently authorized to enter into such leases, according to agency officials. If authorized, leasing capacity could generate revenues that could help offset the costs of modernization. By not examining a full range of options, DOE risks missing beneficial ways to modernize the SPR while saving taxpayer resources. GAO is making four recommendations, including that DOE (1) supplement the 2016 review by conducting an additional analysis, (2) ensure that the agency periodically reexamines the size of the SPR, and (3) consider a full range of options for handling potentially excess assets as it conducts its study, among other things.

The VA decided to transition to MSPV-NG to address these issues.\n\nThe transition involved multiple stakeholders, including procurement offices, logistics personnel, and clinical staff. The program included new contracts with vendors and prime vendors. The goals of MSPV-NG were to standardize supplies, achieve cost savings through competitive awards, improve efficiency in ordering and supply chain management, and involve clinicians in requirements development.\n\nThe transition started in December 2016, with a 4-month period where the legacy program was still in use. After April 2017, the legacy program was phased out. The new program restricts ordering to a narrow formulary. The VA's goals included clinical standardization, cost avoidance, efficiency, and clinician involvement.\n\nHowever, the implementation of MSPV-NG had several issues. The VA lacked a documented program strategy, leadership stability, and workforce capacity. The initial requirements development process was based on prior purchases without clinician input, leading to an ineffective formulary. The program also faced challenges in contracting, with many items not being competitively awarded, resulting in lower utilization rates than desired.\n\nThe report mentions that the VA made some changes in the second phase of requirements development to address deficiencies.

The program's goals include involving clinicians in requirements development, leveraging buying power when making competitive awards, and consolidating supplies used across medical centers. VA began developing requirements in early 2015 and launched the program in December 2016. This testimony summarizes key information contained in GAO's November 2017 report, GAO-18-34 . Specifically, it addresses the extent to which VA's implementation of MSPV-NG has been effective in meeting program goals. GAO analyzed VA's requirements development and contracting processes, and identified key supply chain practices cited by four leading hospital networks. GAO also met with contracting and clinical officials at six medical centers, selected based on high dollar contract obligations in fiscal years 2014-2016 and geographic representation. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) established the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor-Next Generation (MSPV-NG) program to provide an efficient, cost-effective way for its facilities to order supplies, but its initial implementation did not have an overarching strategy, stable leadership, and workforce capacity that could have facilitated medical center buy-in for the change. VA also developed requirements for a broad range of MSPV-NG items with limited clinical input. Further, starting in June 2015, VA planned to award competitive contracts, but instead, 79 percent of the items available for purchase under MSPV-NG were added through non-competitive agreements. (See figure). As a result, the program did not meet the needs of medical centers, and usage remained below VA's 40 percent target. (See figure.) VA has taken steps to address some deficiencies and is developing a new approach to the program. However, VA will likely continue to face challenges in meeting its goals until it fully addresses these existing shortcomings. GAO made 10 recommendations in its November 2017 report, including that VA develop an overarching strategy, expand clinician input in requirements development, and establish a plan for awarding future competitive contracts.

{"pred": " The report provides an in-depth overview of the U.S. Navy's ship-naming policies, practices, and historical traditions. It explains that while the Secretary of the Navy traditionally has the authority to name ships, this power is not explicitly codified in law. Instead, the process is guided by historical practices and evolving traditions. The report highlights that the naming of ships is a multifaceted process involving input from various sources, including the Naval History and Heritage Command, the Chief of Naval Operations, service members, Navy veterans, and the public. The Secretary of the Navy considers recommendations, along with his own thoughts and preferences, to select names for ships. The process typically involves the Naval History and Heritage Command compiling primary and alternate ship name recommendations, which are then forwarded to the Chief of Naval Operations by way of the chain of command. These recommendations are based on research into the history of the Navy and suggestions from various groups. The report also discusses the evolution of naming conventions over time, noting that while certain types of ships have been traditionally named for specific categories (e.g., cities, states, battles), these conventions have changed as the Navy's needs and technological advancements have evolved. For example, attack submarines were once named for fish, then later for cities, and most recently for states. The report emphasizes that the naming of ships is not a rigid process but rather one that has evolved over time, shaped by the Navy's history and traditions. It also notes that while there are established naming conventions, exceptions are occasionally made, particularly for the purpose of naming a ship for a person when the rule for that type of ship would have called for it to be named for something else. The report discusses several examples of such exceptions, including the naming of ships for living persons, which is a relatively rare occurrence. The report also addresses the issue of naming ships for Confederate officers, which has been a point of controversy. The Navy has historically avoided naming ships for living persons, but there have been exceptions, such as the naming of the aircraft carrier CVN-70 for Carl Vinson, who was still alive at the time of the announcement. The report also discusses the naming of ships for individuals who were not alive at the time of the announcement, such as the naming of the destroyer DDG-113 for John Finn, who was a living person at the time of the announcement. The report highlights the importance of the naming process in honoring the contributions of individuals, places, and historical events. It also notes that the naming of ships is influenced by the", "answers": ["Names for Navy ships traditionally have been chosen and announced by the Secretary of the Navy, under the direction of the President and in accordance with rules prescribed by Congress.

There have been exceptions to the Navy's ship-naming rules, particularly for the purpose of naming a ship for a person when the rule for that type of ship would have called for it to be named for something else. Some observers have perceived a breakdown in, or corruption of, the rules for naming Navy ships. On July 13, 2012, the Navy submitted to Congress a 73-page report on the Navy's policies and practices for naming ships. For ship types now being procured for the Navy, or recently procured for the Navy, naming rules can be summarized as follows: The first Ohio replacement ballistic missile submarine (SSBN-826) has been named Columbia in honor of the District of Columbia, but the Navy has not stated what the naming rule for these ships will be. Virginia (SSN-774) class attack submarines are being named for states. Aircraft carriers are generally named for past U.S. Presidents. Of the past 14, 10 were named for past U.S. Presidents, and 2 for Members of Congress. Destroyers are being named for deceased members of the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, including Secretaries of the Navy. The Navy has not yet announced a naming rule for its planned new class of FFG(X) frigates, the first of which the Navy wants to procure in FY2021. Previous classes of U.S. Navy frigates, like Navy destroyers, were generally named for naval leaders and heroes. Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) are being named for regionally important U.S. cities and communities. Amphibious assault ships are being named for important battles in which U.S. Marines played a prominent part, and for famous earlier U.S. Navy ships that were not named for battles. San Antonio (LPD-17) class amphibious ships are being named for major U.S. cities and communities, and cities and communities attacked on September 11, 2001. John Lewis (TAO-205) class oilers are being named for people who fought for civil rights and human rights. Expeditionary Fast Transports (EPFs) are being named for small U.S. cities. Expeditionary Transport Docks (ESDs) and Expeditionary Sea Bases (ESBs) are being named for famous names or places of historical significance to U.S. Marines. Navajo (TATS-6) class towing, salvage, and rescue ships are being named for prominent Native Americans or Native American tribes. Since 1974, at least 21 U.S. military ships have been named for persons who were living at the time the name was announced. The most recent instance occurred on May 6, 2019, when the Navy announced that it was naming the destroyer DDG-51 for former Senator Sam Nunn. Members of the public are sometimes interested in having Navy ships named for their own states or cities, for older U.S. Navy ships (particularly those on which they or their relatives served), for battles in which they or their relatives participated, or for people they admire. Congress has long maintained an interest in how Navy ships are named, and has influenced the naming of certain Navy ships. The Navy suggests that congressional offices wishing to express support for proposals to name a Navy ship for a specific person, place, or thing contact the office of the Secretary of the Navy to make their support known. Congress may also pass legislation relating to ship names. Measures passed by Congress in recent years regarding Navy ship names have all been sense-of-the-Congress provisions."], "all_classes": null, "length": 9736}
{"pred": " The U.S. Fourth National Climate Assessment (2018) highlights that climate change is already affecting the United States and will intensify in the future, with the severity of these impacts depending on actions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and adapt to changes. While various efforts to reduce GHG emissions are underway at the international and sub-national levels, federal policymakers and stakeholders have differing viewpoints on how to address future climate change and its impacts. Some argue that climate change poses a \"direct, existential threat\" to human society and that nations must significantly reduce GHG emissions to avoid \"dire effects.\" Others question the sufficiency of risks to justify federal programs for GHG emission reductions. The report focuses on the policy considerations and potential impacts of using a carbon tax or GHG emissions fee to control GHG emissions. A carbon tax could apply either directly to GHG emissions or to the materials—based on their carbon contents—that ultimately generate the emissions. This approach would increase the relative price of more carbon-intensive energy sources, such as coal, potentially spurring innovation in less carbon-intensive technologies and encouraging other behaviors that may decrease emissions. The energy price increases could have both economy-wide impacts and negative effects on specific industries and particular demographic groups. The report does not compare and analyze the multiple policy tools available to Congress that could address climate change. Instead, it focuses on the policy considerations and potential impacts of using a carbon tax or GHG emissions fee to control GHG emissions. The key human-related GHG is CO2, which is generated primarily through the combustion of fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas. In 2016, fossil fuel combustion accounted for 94% of U.S. CO2 emissions and 76% of U.S. GHG emissions. A carbon tax could apply either directly to GHG emissions or to the materials—based on their carbon contents—that ultimately generate the emissions (i.e., \"emissions inputs\"). A carbon price on emissions or their emissions inputs—mainly fossil fuels—would increase the relative price of the more carbon-intensive energy sources, particularly coal. This result could spur innovation in less carbon-intensive technologies (e.g., renewable energy, nuclear power, carbon capture and sequestration [CCS]) and stimulate other behavior that may decrease emissions, such as efficiency improvements. The energy price increases could also have both economy-wide impacts and negative effects on specific industries and particular demographic groups. A carbon tax approach has received some attention and debate in recent years. In the 11", "answers": ["The U.S. Fourth National Climate Assessment, released in 2018, concluded that \"the impacts of global climate change are already being felt in the United States and are projected to intensify in the future—but the severity of future impacts will depend largely on actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas [GHG] emissions and to adapt to the changes that will occur.\" Members of Congress and stakeholders articulate a wide range of perspectives over what to do, if anything, about GHG emissions, future climate change, and related impacts. If Congress were to consider establishing a program to reduce GHG emissions, one option would be to attach a price to GHG emissions with a carbon tax or GHG emissions fee. In the 115th Congress, Members introduced nine bills to establish a carbon tax or emissions fee program. However, many Members have expressed their opposition to such an approach. In particular, in the 115th Congress, the House passed a resolution \"expressing the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the United States economy.\" Multiple economic studies have estimated the emission reductions that particular carbon tax would achieve. For example, a 2018 study analyzed various impacts of four carbon tax rate scenarios: a $25/metric ton of CO2 and $50/metric ton of CO2 carbon tax, increasing annually by 1% and 5%. The study concluded that each of the scenarios would likely achieve the U.S. GHG emission reduction target pledged under the international Paris Agreement (at least in terms of CO2 emissions). A carbon tax system would generate a new revenue stream, the magnitude of which would depend on the scope and rate of the tax, among other factors. In 2018, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that a $25/metric ton carbon tax would yield approximately $100 billion in its first year. CBO projected that federal revenue would total $3.5 trillion in FY2019. Policymakers would face challenging decisions regarding the distribution of the new carbon tax revenues. Congress could apply revenues to support a range of policy objectives but would encounter trade-offs among the objectives. The central trade-offs involve minimizing economy-wide costs, lessening the costs borne by specific groups—particularly low-income households and displaced workers in certain industries (e.g., coal mining)—and supporting other policy objectives. A primary argument against a carbon tax regards it potential economy-wide impacts, often measured as impacts to the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). Some may argue that projected impacts should be compared with the climate benefits achieved from the program as well as the estimated costs of taking no action. The potential impacts would depend on a number of factors, including the program's magnitude and design and, most importantly, the use of carbon tax revenues. In general, economic literature finds that some of the revenue applications would reduce the economy-wide costs from a carbon tax but may not eliminate them entirely. In addition, some studies cite particular economic modeling scenarios in which certain carbon tax revenue applications produce a net increase in GDP compared to a baseline scenario. These scenarios involve using carbon tax revenues to offset reductions in other tax rates (e.g., corporate income or payroll taxes). Although economic models generally indicate that these particular revenue applications would yield the greatest benefit to the economy overall, the models also find that lower-income households would likely face a disproportionate impact under such an approach. As lower-income households spend a greater proportion of their income on energy needs (electricity, gasoline), these households are expected to experience disproportionate impacts from a carbon tax if revenues were not recycled back to them in some fashion (e.g., lump-sum distribution). A price on GHG emissions could create a competitive disadvantage for some industries, particularly \"emission-intensive, trade-exposed industries.\" Policymakers have several options to address this concern, including establishing a \"border carbon adjustment\" program, which would levy a fee on imports from countries without comparable GHG reduction programs. Alternatively, policymakers could allocate (indefinitely or for a period of time) some of the carbon tax revenues to selected industry sectors or businesses. Relatedly, a carbon tax system is projected to disproportionately impact fossil fuel industries, particularly coal, and the communities that rely on their employment. To alleviate these impacts, policymakers may consider using some of the revenue to provide transition assistance to employees or affected communities."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8507}
{"pred": " The report discusses the financial challenges facing the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund (RHB Fund), which is used to provide health insurance for postal retirees. The RHB Fund is currently on an unsustainable path and is projected to be depleted in 12 years under the status quo. USPS has missed approximately $38 billion in payments to the fund since fiscal year 2010, and the fund’s balance is declining. Beginning in fiscal year 2017, OPM started drawing from the fund to pay USPS’s share of premiums for postal retirees’ health benefits. OPM’s payments in that year exceeded the fund’s income from interest, and OPM projects that, based on the status quo, future payments will continue to exceed the fund’s income from interest. As long as USPS continues to miss its annual payments—which were nearly $4.3 billion in fiscal year 2017 and are $4.5 billion in fiscal year 2018—the fund is on track to be depleted in fiscal year 2030 based on OPM projections requested by us. The report also highlights the financial challenges faced by companies and state governments in providing retiree health benefits, with many companies and states eliminating or reducing such benefits due to financial constraints, rising health care costs, and legal ability to change programs. The report outlines eight potential policy approaches to address the financial sustainability of postal retiree health benefits, which fall into three categories: (1) approaches that shift costs to the federal government; (2) approaches that reduce benefits or increase costs to postal retirees and/or postal employees; and (3) approaches that change how the benefits are financed. These approaches are not mutually exclusive, nor are they an exhaustive list of possible approaches. The report also discusses the potential consequences of the RHB Fund being depleted, including the impact on postal retirees, USPS, and other stakeholders.

The 2006 PAEA required USPS to prefund, leading to the RHB Fund. However,", "answers": ["USPS is required to prefund its share of health benefits costs for its retirees. To do so, USPS is required to make payments into the RHB Fund, which is administered by OPM. However, USPS has not made any payments to the fund since fiscal year 2010. At the end of fiscal year 2017, USPS had missed $38.2 billion in payments, leaving the fund 44 percent funded. Pursuant to law, beginning in fiscal year 2017, OPM started drawing from the fund to cover USPS's share of postal retirees' health benefits premiums. GAO was asked to review issues related to the sustainability of the RHB Fund. This report examines (1) the financial outlook for the RHB Fund and (2) policy approaches for postal retiree health benefits, among other topics. GAO evaluated financial projections for the RHB Fund from OPM. GAO reviewed laws and regulations and identified policy approaches primarily by identifying legislative proposals, and literature on actions of companies and state governments to address retiree health benefits. These approaches are not exhaustive or mutually exclusive. GAO also interviewed experts in retiree health benefits and postal stakeholders, chosen on the basis of relevant publications and prior GAO work, and interviewed and obtained written responses from OPM and USPS officials. The financial outlook of the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund (RHB Fund) is poor. At the end of fiscal year 2017, the fund's assets declined to $49.8 billion and unfunded liabilities rose to $62.2 billion. Based on Office of Personnel Management (OPM) projections requested by GAO, the fund is on track to be depleted in fiscal year 2030 if the United States Postal Service (USPS) continues to make no payments into the fund. Annual payments of $1 billion or $2 billion into the fund would extend the projected depletion date by 2 to 5 years (see figure). USPS has said that its required payments to the fund are unaffordable relative to its current financial situation and outlook. For the past 11 years USPS has incurred large operating losses that it expects will continue. Additionally, USPS has stated that its opportunities for revenue generation and cost-cutting are limited. USPS reported that it did not make required fund payments in 2017 in order to preserve liquidity and cover operational costs. If the fund becomes depleted, USPS would be required by law to make the payments necessary to cover its share of health benefits premiums for current postal retirees. Current law does not address what would happen if the fund becomes depleted and USPS does not make payments to cover those premiums. Depletion of the fund could affect postal retirees as well as USPS, customers, and other stakeholders, including the federal government. About 500,000 postal retirees receive health benefits and OPM expects that number to remain about the same through 2035. GAO identified three categories of policy approaches for postal retiree health benefits, based on legislative proposals and pertinent literature. First, some approaches, such as generally requiring eligible postal retirees to participate in Medicare, would shift costs to the federal government. Second, some approaches would reduce benefits or increase costs to postal retirees and/or employees. Third, some approaches would change how benefits are financed (see table). All of these approaches have different potential effects and would require congressional action. Thus, it is up to Congress to consider the merits of different approaches and determine the most appropriate action to take. It would be preferable to take action when careful consideration is possible, rather than wait until lack of adequate funding could disrupt postal retiree health benefits.

{"pred": " The report discusses neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), a condition that affects infants born to mothers who used opioids during pregnancy. NAS can result from various forms of prenatal opioid use, including prescription medications, medication-assisted treatment, prescription drug misuse, and illicit opioid use. The report highlights that medication-assisted treatment is considered the standard of care for pregnant women with opioid use disorders, as it can prevent complications associated with illicit opioid use, encourage prenatal care, and reduce the risk of obstetric complications. However, there are gaps in research on the most effective treatment approaches for pregnant women with opioid use disorders, and more research is needed to understand how best to treat these women while minimizing risks to the fetus. The report also discusses the treatment of infants with NAS, including non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches. Non-pharmacologic treatment includes placing the infant in a dark and quiet environment, swaddling, breastfeeding, rooming-in with the mother, and providing high-calorie nutrition. Pharmacologic treatment, such as using methadone or morphine, may be necessary only for the relief of moderate to severe signs of NAS. The report also highlights the importance of non-pharmacologic treatment, such as allowing the mother to reside with the infant during treatment, to facilitate the mother-infant bond. Additionally, the report discusses the challenges in addressing NAS, including the use of multiple substances by pregnant women, which can exacerbate NAS symptoms, the stigma faced by women who use opioids during pregnancy, which may affect whether they seek prenatal care, hospital staff burden and limited physical capacity to care for infants with NAS, limited coordination of care for mothers and infants with NAS, and gaps in research and data on NAS. The report also discusses the efforts of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to address NAS, including the publication of a strategy known as the Protecting Our Infants Act: Final Strategy, which includes 39 recommendations related to the prevention, treatment, and related services for NAS and prenatal opioid use. However, the report notes that HHS lacks a comprehensive plan for implementing these recommendations, including explicit priorities, timeframes, roles and responsibilities, and methods for assessing progress. The report concludes that HHS should expedite the development of a plan to implement the NAS-related recommendations in the Protecting Our Infants Act: Final Strategy, which would include priorities, timeframes, clear roles and responsibilities, and methods for assessing progress.

A recent peer-reviewed study found that cases of NAS have grown nearly five-fold between 2000 and 2012 and that most infants with NAS are covered under Medicaid. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 includes a provision for GAO to examine NAS in the United States and related treatment services covered under Medicaid. This report 1) describes the hospital and non-hospital settings for treating infants with NAS and how Medicaid pays for services, 2) describes recommended practices and challenges for addressing NAS, and 3) examines HHS's strategy for addressing NAS. GAO reviewed HHS documentation and interviewed HHS officials. GAO also conducted site visits to four states—Kentucky, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin—selected based on several factors, including incidence rates of NAS and geographic variation. GAO interviewed stakeholders from 32 organizations, including health care providers and state officials in the selected states. The prenatal use of opioids or other drugs can produce a withdrawal condition in newborns known as neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Health care providers, state officials, and other stakeholders told GAO that most infants with NAS are treated in the hospital—such as in a neonatal intensive care unit—though some may be referred to a non-hospital setting—such as a neonatal withdrawal center with nursery rooms—to complete their treatment. The table below provides more information on settings for treating infants with NAS and on how Medicaid pays for services in these settings. According to stakeholders GAO interviewed and literature reviewed, there are several recommended practices and challenges associated with addressing NAS. The most frequently recommended practices included prioritizing non-pharmacologic treatment to infants—treatment that does not involve medications—such as allowing the mother to reside with the infant during treatment; educating mothers and health care providers on treatment of NAS, among other things; and using a protocol in the hospital or non-hospital setting for screening and treating infants with NAS. The most frequently cited challenges included the maternal use of multiple drugs—or polysubstance use—as it can exacerbate NAS symptoms; stigma faced by pregnant women who use opioids; hospital staff burden and limited physical capacity to care for infants with NAS; limited coordination of care for mothers and infants with NAS; and gaps in research and data on NAS, such as research on the long-term effects of the condition. In May 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a strategy document that makes key recommendations to address NAS. The Strategy recommends, for example, that health care providers receive continuing education on managing and treating infants with NAS and promote non-pharmacologic treatment. According to HHS officials, these recommendations will inform planning and policy across the department. However, HHS has yet to determine how and when the recommendations will be implemented, including establishing priorities; the roles and responsibilities of other federal, state, and public stakeholders; implementation timeframes; and methods for assessing progress. HHS officials told GAO that they expect to develop an implementation plan sometime in 2017 but had no timeline for doing so. Without a plan that clearly specifies how HHS will implement the Strategy and assess its progress, the department increases the risk that its recommendations for addressing NAS will not be implemented.

The report also covers various enforcement actions taken by the FTC against companies for privacy violations, including COPPA violations. It mentions", "answers": ["In April 2018, Facebook disclosed that a Cambridge University researcher may have improperly shared the data of up to 87 million of its users with a political consulting firm. This disclosure followed other recent incidents involving the misuse of consumers' personal information from the Internet, which is used by about three-quarters of Americans. GAO was asked to review federal oversight of Internet privacy. This report addresses, among other objectives: (1) how FTC and FCC have overseen consumers' Internet privacy and (2) selected stakeholders' views on the strengths and limitations of how Internet privacy currently is overseen and how, if it all, this approach could be enhanced. GAO evaluated FTC and FCC Internet privacy enforcement actions and authorities and interviewed representatives from industry, consumer advocacy groups, and academia; FTC and FCC staff; former FTC and FCC commissioners; and officials from other federal oversight agencies. Industry stakeholders were selected to represent different sectors, and academics were selected because of their expertise in privacy, consumer protection, and regulatory issues. The United States does not have a comprehensive Internet privacy law governing the collection, use, and sale or other disclosure of consumers' personal information. At the federal level, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) currently has the lead in overseeing Internet privacy, using its statutory authority under the FTC Act to protect consumers from unfair and deceptive trade practices. However, to date FTC has not issued regulations for Internet privacy other than those protecting financial privacy and the Internet privacy of children, which were required by law. For FTC Act violations, FTC may promulgate regulations but is required to use procedures that differ from traditional notice-and-comment processes and that FTC staff said add time and complexity. In the last decade, FTC has filed 101 enforcement actions regarding Internet privacy; nearly all actions resulted in settlement agreements requiring action by the companies. In most of these cases, FTC did not levy civil penalties because it lacked such authority for those particular violations. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has had a limited role in overseeing Internet privacy. From 2015 to 2017, FCC asserted jurisdiction over the privacy practices of Internet service providers. In 2016, FCC promulgated privacy rules for Internet service providers that Congress later repealed. FTC resumed privacy oversight of Internet service providers in June 2018. Stakeholders GAO interviewed had varied views on the current Internet privacy enforcement approach and how it could be enhanced. Most Internet industry stakeholders said they favored FTC's current approach—direct enforcement of its unfair and deceptive practices statutory authority, rather than promulgating and enforcing regulations implementing that authority. These stakeholders said that the current approach allows for flexibility and that regulations could hinder innovation. Other stakeholders, including consumer advocates and most former FTC and FCC commissioners GAO interviewed, favored having FTC issue and enforce regulations. Some stakeholders said a new data-protection agency was needed to oversee consumer privacy. Stakeholders identified three main areas in which Internet privacy oversight could be enhanced: Statute . Some stakeholders told GAO that an overarching Internet privacy statute could enhance consumer protection by clearly articulating to consumers, industry, and agencies what behaviors are prohibited. Rulemaking . Some stakeholders said that regulations can provide clarity, enforcement fairness, and flexibility. Officials from two other consumer protection agencies said their rulemaking authority assists in their oversight efforts and works together with enforcement actions. Civil penalty authority. Some stakeholders said FTC's Internet privacy enforcement could be more effective with authority to levy civil penalties for first-time violations of the FTC Act.

The report is from a government agency, probably GAO (Government Accountability Office), discussing the FBI's headquarters situation.\n\nFirst, the report mentions that in 2011, the FBI and GSA did studies on the Hoover Building and other facilities. They found that the current facilities don't meet the FBI's long-term security, space, and building condition needs. Since then, the assessment hasn't changed much.\n\nSecurity issues: After 9/11, the FBI expanded, outgrowing the Hoover Building. They use annexes, some in multitenant buildings with non-federal tenants. This setup raises security concerns, especially for nine annexes. Also, the FBI leases space from foreign owners in six locations, including DC. This could pose risks like espionage and unauthorized access.\n\nSpace issues: The Hoover Building has 2.4 million sq ft, but much is unusable. The remaining space isn't designed for current FBI needs. The building's original design is inefficient, making it hard to reconfigure for collaboration. GSA's 2017 prospectus said the Hoover Building can't be redeveloped to meet current and future operational requirements. This leads to operational and logistical challenges. Also, staff dispersion in annexes hampers collaboration and classified work.\n\nBuilding condition: The Hoover Building's condition is deteriorating. GSA has limited investments to maintain safety and functioning systems while assessing FBI's needs. This increases the risk of system failures and operational disruptions. The FBI is likely to stay in the building for several more years, so GSA was advised to evaluate strategies to minimize major repair investments and address any facility condition issues that could risk operations and lead to further deterioration.\n\nIn 2014, GSA evaluated its strategy for the Hoover Building and decided to complete some repairs to ensure safety and maintain tenancy. For example, they funded waterproofing of the mezzanine level and repairs to the concrete facade. However, in July 2017, GSA and FBI officials canceled the procurement for the new FBI headquarters consolidation project due to lack of funding. They emphasized that the need for a new headquarters remains, and they'll continue working on space requirements.\n\nThe report also discusses GSA's use of swap exchanges to address federal property challenges. Swap exchanges allow GSA to use the value of a federal property in an exchange to fund", "answers": ["GSA, which manages federal real property on behalf of other federal agencies, faces challenges in funding new construction projects due to budget constraints—including obtaining upfront funding—among other reasons. One type of transaction, called a swap exchange, enables GSA to apply the value of federal property to finance construction without relying on appropriated funds. Under such an exchange, GSA transfers the title of the unneeded property to a private investor after receiving the agreed upon construction services at another location. GSA proposed a swap exchange procurement for construction of a new FBI headquarters building in exchange for the Hoover Building and appropriations to compensate for the difference in value between the Hoover Building and the new building. GSA cancelled this procurement in July 2017 due to lack of funding. This statement addresses (1) GSA's and FBI's assessments of the Hoover Building, (2) GSA efforts to implement swap exchanges, and (3) alternative approaches to funding real property projects. It is based on GAO's body of reports on real property from 2011 to 2017, and selected updates from GSA. In November 2011, GAO reported that, according to General Services Administration (GSA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) assessments, the FBI's headquarters building (Hoover Building) and its accompanying facilities in Washington, D.C., did not fully support the FBI's long-term security, space, and building condition requirements. Since GAO's report, the assessments have not materially changed, for example: Security: GAO's prior work noted that the dispersion of staff in annexes creates security challenges, including where some space was leased by the FBI and other space was leased by nonfederal tenants. Earlier this year, GAO reported the FBI is leasing space in D.C. from foreign owners. Space : In 2011, GAO reported that FBI and GSA studies showed that much of the Hoover Building is unusable. GSA noted in its fiscal year 2017 project prospectus for the FBI headquarters consolidation that the Hoover Building cannot be redeveloped to meet the FBI's current needs. Building Condition: In GAO's 2011 report, GAO noted that the condition of the Hoover Building was deteriorating, and GSA assessments identified significant recapitalization needs. Since GAO's report and in response to GAO's recommendation, GSA has evaluated its approach to maintaining the building and completed some repairs to ensure safety. GSA has limited experience in successfully completing swap exchange transactions and chose not to pursue several proposed swap exchanges, most recently the planned swap exchange for the Hoover Building. GSA has developed criteria for determining when to solicit market interest in a swap exchange, in response to recommendations in GAO's 2014 report. In addition, GSA officials told GAO that they planned to improve the swap exchange process, including the property appraisal process, outreach to stakeholders to identify potential risks associated with future projects, and to the extent possible, mitigate such risks. Nevertheless, several factors may continue to limit use of swap exchanges, including market factors, such as the availability of alternative properties and an investor's approach for valuing properties. For example, in reviewing a proposed swap exchange in Washington, D.C., GAO found in a 2016 report that the proposals from two firms valued the two federal buildings involved in the proposed swap substantially less than GSA's appraised property value. In a 2014 report, GAO identified a number of alternative approaches to funding real property projects. Congress has provided some agencies with specific authorities to use alternative funding mechanisms—including the use of private sector funds or land swaps—for the acquisition, renovation, or disposal of federal real property without full, upfront funding, though GAO has previously reported that upfront funding is the best way to ensure recognition of commitments made in budgeting decisions and maintain fiscal controls. GAO has reported that projects with alternative funding mechanisms present multiple forms of risk that are shared between the agency and any partner or stakeholder. In addition, alternative budgetary structures could be established, such as changing existing or introducing new account structures to fund real property projects. GAO has made recommendations in the past to GSA on various real property issues, including to develop additional guidance for swap exchanges and to evaluate its approach to maintaining the Hoover Building. GSA agreed with these two recommendations and addressed them."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2284}

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report starts by explaining the two main objectives of the UI system: providing temporary, partial wage replacement for involuntarily unemployed workers and stabilizing the economy during recessions. Then it goes into detail about the programs, like the Unemployment Compensation (UC) and Extended Benefit (EB) programs. It mentions that UC provides up to 26 weeks of benefits, and EB can add 13 or 20 weeks under certain economic conditions. However, as of the report's date, no state is in an active EB period.\n\nNext, the report talks about the legal framework, including the Social Security Act of 1935, which authorizes the UC program. It notes that most states offer up to 26 weeks of UC benefits, with some special programs for federal employees (UCFE) and ex-servicemembers (UCX). There's also mention of the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 1991, which ensures these groups are treated the same as other unemployed workers regarding benefits.\n\nThe report then explains how the UC program is funded, with federal taxes under FUTA and state taxes under SUTA. It mentions that the FUTA tax is 0.6% on the first $7,000 of each employee's earnings, and SUTA rates vary by state. The report also discusses the Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF) and how funds are managed, including the impact of sequester reductions on EB and administrative costs.\n\nThere's a section about the 2018 government shutdown and its effects on federal employees, including eligibility for UCFE benefits. The report mentions that some states might not require these employees to search for work if there's an expected recall. However, the Department of Labor's guidance suggests that excepted employees working without pay might be ineligible for UCFE benefits based on state definitions of unemployment.\n\nThe report also covers the recent government shutdown and the subsequent legislative actions, such as the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019, which authorized retroactive pay for furloughed employees. This could lead to overpayment issues, which states would need to handle according to their laws.\n\nAnother part of the report discusses the financial aspects of the UI system, including the solvency of state", "answers": ["The 116th Congress has begun to consider several issues related to two programs in the unemployment insurance (UI) system: Unemployment Compensation (UC) and Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE). The lapse in federal appropriations that occurred from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019, created a partial government shutdown. As a result, agencies without funding furloughed many federal employees, and many federal employees excepted from furlough were working without pay during the lapse in appropriations. Furloughed federal employees may be eligible for UCFE benefits. Private-sector workers who are furloughed or laid off due to the partial government shutdown because they were employed by government contractors may be eligible for regular UC benefits. But, according to guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), excepted federal employees who are performing services (without pay) would generally be ineligible for UCFE benefits based on states' definitions of \"unemployment.\" In this climate, there has been congressional interest in assisting furloughed and excepted federal employees through the UI system. UI legislative issues currently facing the 116th Congress include the following: the effects of the FY2019 sequester order on UI programs and benefits, the role of UI in providing temporary income replacement during a government shutdown, state fiscal concerns related to financing UC benefits, reemployment services and eligibility assessments (RESEA), potential consideration of the UI proposals included in the President's FY2020 budget, and congressional oversight related to a proposed UC drug testing rule reissued by DOL after previously being disapproved using the Congressional Review Act. In the 116th Congress, policymakers have introduced legislation related to UCFE benefits in response to the recent partial government shutdown (S. 165, H.R. 720, H.R. 725, and H.R. 1117), legislation to provide self-employment and relocation assistance benefits (S. 136 and H.R. 556), legislation to require that states consider an individual who quit employment because of sexual harassment, domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking to be eligible for UC benefits (H.R. 1585), and legislation to amend Title III of the Social Security Act to extend RESEA to all UC claimants (H.R. 1759).

{"pred": " The report examines the Federal Bureau of Prisons' (BOP) use of retention incentives, internal controls, and strategic planning for these incentives. BOP, under the oversight of the Department of Justice's Justice Management Division (JMD), manages human resources, including retention incentives, to retain staff in hard-to-fill positions. Retention incentives are funded through the Salaries and Expenses appropriation account, which accounted for nearly 93% of BOP's budget in FY 2016. These incentives are administered by the Central Office, regional offices, and institutions, with the Central Office's Human Resource Management Division (HRMD) and Program Review Division (PRD) overseeing the process. BOP's retention incentive expenditures increased from $10.7 million in FY 2012 to $14.0 million in FY 2016, with the number of employees receiving incentives also rising. The majority of these expenditures were concentrated in four California institutions and for medical professionals nationwide. The California institutions—USP Atwater, FCI Herlong, FCI Mendota, and FCC Victorville—received retention incentives to supplement correctional officers' salaries, which were lower than those in state and local prisons. Medical professionals, on the other hand, received retention incentives to help retain these employees, as BOP salaries were lower than those in the private sector. BOP has a number of internal controls in place to ensure that retention incentive applications meet BOP and other requirements. These controls are part of a multilayered application and review process that begins at the institution and culminates at BOP's Central Office. The report also found that BOP does not have a strategic plan for using retention incentives to meet long-term human capital goals. While BOP uses retention incentives to address critical skills gaps, such as with medical professionals, it has not evaluated the effectiveness of these incentives in relation to other human capital flexibilities. The report concludes with two recommendations to BOP: 1) to include human capital goals and strategies for using retention incentives in its upcoming strategic human capital operating plan, and 2) to evaluate the effectiveness of its use of retention incentives to determine if adjustments are needed for improved results. The report also highlights the importance of evaluating the effectiveness of retention incentives to better manage BOP's long-term human capital goals and address staffing challenges.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this detailed report about the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) and their use of retention incentives. Let", "answers": ["BOP is the largest employer within DOJ and is responsible for the care and custody of an inmate population of about 186,000. BOP has faced challenges retaining staff at correctional facilities, although it has used retention incentives, along with other human capital flexibilities. GAO was asked to review BOP's use of retention incentives. This report addresses: (1) how BOP used its authority to pay retention incentives; (2) internal controls BOP has in place for the use of retention incentives; and (3) the extent to which BOP plans for and evaluates the use of retention incentives. GAO obtained employee-level retention incentive expenditure data from DOJ's Justice Management Division for fiscal years 2012 through 2016. GAO also reviewed agency documentation, such as policy statements and 40 randomly selected retention incentive application packet case files from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. GAO also interviewed officials from BOP's Central Office and four correctional facilities that use retention incentives, selected to reflect variation in the number and types of employees receiving retention incentives, BOP regions, and BOP institution security levels. From fiscal years 2012 to 2016, the Department of Justice's (DOJ) Federal Bureau of Prisons' (BOP) total retention incentive expenditures generally increased from $10.7 to $14.0 million and the number of employees receiving retention incentives increased from 2,024 to 2,460. During those five years, BOP spent more than 97 percent of its total retention incentive expenditures on employees at four BOP institutions in California and for medical professionals nationwide. Further, total retention incentive expenditures for medical professionals increased by an average of 21 percent per year (see figure). According to BOP officials, BOP uses retention incentives, for example, to supplement BOP's medical professionals' salaries which are generally lower than private sector salaries. BOP has a variety of internal controls in place throughout the retention incentive process that help ensure retention incentive applications and approvals meet requirements. For example, each application goes through multiple levels of review to verify its accuracy and completeness. BOP takes steps to determine workforce needs and how to fill those needs, but has not strategically planned for and evaluated its use of retention incentives. According to BOP, planning for human capital needs is conducted at institutions during quarterly meetings, but discussions about these incentives respond to short-term staffing situations rather than proactively addressing future staffing needs. Including human capital goals and strategies in BOP's human capital plan would create a roadmap so the agency could move from being reactive to its current workforce needs to being strategic in trying to achieve its long-term workforce goals. Additionally BOP has not evaluated the effectiveness of its use of retention incentives in retaining staff. As a result, BOP does not know whether retention incentives have contributed to employees' retention in relation to other incentives used by BOP. Consistent with key principles for strategic human capital planning, planning for and evaluating the use of retention incentives could help BOP better determine if these incentives are an efficient and effective means by which to retain staff. GAO recommends that BOP (1) include human capital goals and how retention incentives will be used to achieve these goals in its human capital plan; and (2) evaluate the use of retention incentives.

{"pred": " \n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) oversees the process of vehicle safety defect recalls, which are initiated when a defect poses an unreasonable safety risk. Manufacturers are required to notify vehicle owners via First-Class Mail within 60 days of the recall being initiated, and to provide a remedy for the defect. Franchised dealers perform the recall remedy, while NHTSA reviews draft notification letters to ensure they include required information about the safety defect. The number of vehicles affected by safety defect vehicle recalls has increased dramatically since 2011, with large-scale recalls such as the 2014 General Motors ignition switch recall and the Takata air bag inflator recall, which has affected over 34 million vehicles. NHTSA has implemented various measures to improve recall completion rates, including the development of a coordinated remedy program and the use of an independent monitor to oversee the process. The agency has also focused on enhancing communication with consumers through various channels, including social media and public awareness campaigns. Despite these efforts, recall completion rates have remained relatively flat, ranging from 63 to 67 percent between 2011 and 2014. NHTSA has taken steps to improve the usability of its website, NHTSA.gov, which serves as a primary source of vehicle safety recall information. The agency has consolidated its websites into a single platform, and has made improvements to the website's search capabilities and user experience. However, some consumers experienced difficulties in completing essential auto recall tasks, indicating that NHTSA.gov does not always reflect key website usability practices. NHTSA plans to conduct a website usability study with consumers after the consolidation effort is complete, but has not determined a completion date for this effort. Without a completion date, the website usability difficulties may persist, limiting the effectiveness of NHTSA.gov in providing consumers with recall information about their vehicles. The report also discusses the use of publicly available auto recall information by consumers and industry stakeholders, highlighting the importance of effective communication strategies in improving recall completion rates. The findings suggest that while most consumers find the auto recall areas of NHTSA.gov easy to use, some usability issues remain, which could be addressed through interim steps while the agency continues its website consolidation effort. The report concludes with two recommendations to NHTSA: (1) Determine a completion date for the agency’s website consolidation effort.

Once a defect is identified, auto manufacturers are required to send written notification to vehicle owners by mail. NHTSA also aims to enhance awareness of auto recalls by providing information on its website, NHTSA.gov . The Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act includes a provision requiring GAO to study the use of publicly available safety recall information. This report addresses: (1) how consumers and industry stakeholders use such information and (2) how easy to use do consumers find the auto recall areas of NHTSA.gov, among other objectives. To understand consumers' use of auto recall information and to test website usability, GAO conducted 12 focus groups with 94 consumers who had a recall. Focus groups were held in six locations selected for population and geographic variation. GAO identified key website usability practices and requested an evaluation by website usability professionals. GAO reviewed statutes, regulations, and NHTSA documents, and interviewed industry stakeholders—including 10 manufacturers selected based on sales market share and other factors. Consumers, manufacturers, and auto dealers use publicly available auto recall information differently. For example, the 94 consumers in 12 focus groups that GAO conducted used this information to decide whether to repair their vehicles. These consumers overwhelmingly cited safety risk and convenience as the two most influential factors they considered. Most consumers reported a preference for receiving recall notification by at least one electronic means, such as by e-mail or text message, in addition to mail. However, only 7 of 94 consumers reported receiving electronic notifications, suggesting a gap between the industry's auto recall notification practices and consumers' preferences. (See fig.). In response to a mandate in law, in September 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a proposed rule that, if finalized, would require manufacturers to notify consumers about auto recalls by electronic means in addition to mail. Most consumers in GAO's focus group website usability tests found the auto recall areas of NHTSA's website—NHTSA.gov—easy to use; however, some consumers experienced difficulties when asked to complete auto recall related tasks. For example, when consumers attempted to search for recalls affecting their specific vehicles, some found the search results confusing, leading them to question the accuracy of the results. Similarly, some consumers were hampered in searching for recalls by their vehicles' year, make, and model because the website did not always display model options using plain language. GAO found that the auto recall areas of NHTSA.gov do not always reflect federal and industry key website usability practices, and that an independent evaluation conducted by website usability professionals at GAO's request identified similar issues. NHTSA is in the process of consolidating its websites and plans to conduct a website usability study of NHTSA.gov with consumers after the consolidation is complete. However, the agency has not determined a completion date for the consolidation effort—an essential step for organizations to effectively guide their information technology efforts. Without establishing a completion date and taking interim steps to improve the usability of NHTSA.gov, consumers will likely continue to experience difficulties, which may limit the effectiveness of the website's primary means of providing consumers with information about recalls affecting their vehicles.

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nFirst, the report explains what cluster munitions are. They are weapons that disperse smaller submunitions in mid-air, which can be delivered by aircraft or ground systems. They are valued for their ability to target multiple areas with fewer weapons, making them an \"economy of force\" weapon. However, they have issues like high failure rates and unexploded ordnance (UXO) that pose long-term hazards.\n\nThe report mentions historical use in various conflicts, like World War II, Southeast Asia in the 1960s-70s, Afghanistan, the Gulf War, Yugoslavia, and more recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. It also notes the use by the U.S., UK, and others, leading to significant civilian casualties, especially in Laos where millions of submunitions remain.\n\nThe report discusses the technical aspects of cluster munitions, such as the use of mechanical fuzes and newer sensor-fuzed submunitions that improve accuracy and reduce UXO. However, there are discrepancies in failure rate estimates, with some manufacturers claiming lower rates than mine clearance specialists report. Factors affecting reliability include delivery technique, age, environmental conditions, and damage after dispersal.\n\nThe report also covers the humanitarian impact, including the danger of unexploded submunitions for decades, leading to civilian casualties. The Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) was established to ban the use, development, production, acquisition, transfer, and stockpiling of cluster munitions. However, the CCM allows for certain exceptions, like sensor-fuzed submunitions that can detect and engage single targets, and submunitions with self-destruct features. \n\nThe U.S. has been involved in discussions around banning cluster munitions. Initially, the U.S. supported the CCM but later reversed its position, allowing the use of cluster munitions in certain situations. The 2017 DOD policy removed the 2018 deadline for reducing UXO, allowing combatant commanders to use cluster munitions that don't meet the 1% standard in extreme situations. The policy also requires that new cluster munitions meet the 1% standard or have advanced features to minimize UXO risks.\n\nThe report also mentions the U.S. military", "answers": ["Cluster munitions are air-dropped or ground-launched weapons that release a number of smaller submunitions intended to kill enemy personnel or destroy vehicles.

Cluster munitions have been highly criticized internationally for causing a significant number of civilian deaths, and efforts have been undertaken to ban and regulate their use. The Department of Defense (DOD) continues to view cluster munitions as a military necessity but in 2008 instituted a policy to reduce the failure rate of cluster munitions to 1% or less after 2018. In November 2017, a new DOD policy was issued that essentially reversed the 2008 policy. Under the new policy, combatant commanders can use cluster munitions that do not meet the 1% or less unexploded submunitions standard in extreme situations to meet immediate warfighting demands. In addition, the new policy does not establish a deadline to replace cluster munitions exceeding the 1% rate and states that DOD \"will retain cluster munitions currently in active inventories until the capabilities they provide are replaced with enhanced and more reliable munitions.\" Potential issues for Congress include cluster munitions in an era of precision weapons, other weapons in lieu of cluster munitions, and the potential impact of DOD's 2017 revised cluster munitions policy."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3162}
{"pred": " The report discusses FEMA's Public Assistance (PA) program, which provides federal disaster recovery funds to states, local governments, and other entities to repair damaged infrastructure such as roads, schools, and bridges. The program is managed by FEMA's Office of Response and Recovery and involves a mix of temporary, reservist, and permanent employees. Reservists make up the majority of the PA workforce, with 1,852 employees as of June 2017. The program includes a new delivery model designed to address past challenges with workforce management, information sharing, and hazard mitigation. Key features of the new model include standardized processes, specialized positions, and improved training for both FEMA staff and state/local officials. The model emphasizes early engagement with hazard mitigation specialists to identify opportunities for mitigation during the recovery process. FEMA has implemented several changes to the PA program, including the development of a new information system called FAC-Trax, which aims to improve transparency, efficiency, and management of the PA program. FAC-Trax allows FEMA staff and applicants to review, manage, and track current PA project status and documentation. The system includes standardized forms and required fields and tasks that must be completed before moving on to the next steps in the PA preaward process. The report also highlights challenges with FEMA's management of the PA program, including workforce management, information sharing, and hazard mitigation. For example, the PA program has faced challenges with staff turnover, which has affected the efficiency of the program and delayed recovery efforts after past disasters. The report also discusses FEMA's efforts to improve the PA program, including the development of a new delivery model, which incorporates standardized processes, specialized positions, and improved training for both FEMA staff and state/local officials. The new model aims to enhance the integration of hazard mitigation into the PA program by involving hazard mitigation specialists earlier in the recovery process. Despite these efforts, the report identifies ongoing challenges, including the need for a more comprehensive workforce assessment to determine the number of staff required for the new delivery model. The report also highlights the importance of developing performance measures that align with FEMA's strategic goals for hazard mitigation. In conclusion, the report outlines FEMA's efforts to improve the PA program through the new delivery model, which includes standardized processes, specialized positions, and enhanced training. However, challenges remain in workforce management, information sharing, and the integration of hazard mitigation into the PA program.

Further, costs are rising with disasters, such as Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in 2017. FEMA recently redesigned how the PA program delivers assistance to state and local grantees to improve operations and address past challenges identified by GAO and others. FEMA tested the new delivery model in selected disasters and announced implementation in September 2017. GAO was asked to assess the redesigned PA program. This report examines, among other things, the extent to which FEMA's new delivery model addresses (1) past workforce management challenges and assesses future workforce needs; and (2) past information sharing challenges and key IT management controls. GAO reviewed FEMA policy, strategy, and implementation documents; interviewed FEMA and state officials, PA program applicants, and other stakeholders; and observed implementation of the new model at one test location following Hurricane Matthew in 2016. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) redesigned the Public Assistance (PA) grant program delivery model to address past challenges in workforce management, but has not fully assessed future workforce staffing needs. GAO and others have previously identified challenges related to shortages in experienced and trained FEMA PA staff and high turnover among these staff. These challenges often led to applicants receiving inconsistent guidance and to PA project delays. As part of its new model, FEMA is creating consolidated resource centers to standardize and centralize PA staff responsible for managing grant applications, and new specialized positions, such as hazard mitigation liaisons, program delivery managers, and site inspectors, to ensure more consistent guidance to applicants. However, FEMA has not assessed the workforce needed to fully implement the new model, such as the number of staff needed to fill certain new positions, or to achieve staffing goals for supporting hazard mitigation on PA projects. Fully assessing workforce needs will help to ensure that FEMA has the people and the skills needed to fully implement the new PA model and help to avoid the long-standing workforce challenges the program encountered in the past. FEMA designed a new PA information and case management system—called the FEMA Applicant Case Tracker (FAC-Trax)—to address past information sharing challenges, such as difficulties in sharing grant documentation among FEMA, state, and local officials and tracking the status of PA projects, but additional actions could better ensure effective implementation. Both FEMA and state officials involved in testing of the new model stated that the new information system allows them to better manage and track PA applications and documentation, which could lead to greater transparency and efficiencies in the program. Further, GAO found that this new system fully addresses two of four key information technology (IT) management controls—project planning and risk management—that are necessary to ensure systems work effectively and meet user needs. However, GAO found that FEMA has not fully addressed the other two controls—requirements development and systems testing and integration. By better analyzing progress on high-level user requirements, for example, FEMA will have greater assurance that FAC-Trax will meet user needs and achieve the goals of the new delivery model.

The FY2020 budget request proposes significant reductions from the FY2019 enacted level for DOE energy research and development (R&D) programs, including a reduction of $178 million (-24%) in fossil fuels and $502 million (-38%) in nuclear energy. Energy efficiency and renewable energy R&D would decline by $1.724 billion (-83%). DOE science programs would be reduced by $1.039 billion (-16%). Programs targeted for elimination or phaseout include energy efficiency grants, the Advanced Research Projects Agency—Energy (ARPA-E), and loan guarantee programs. Funding would be reduced for USACE by $2.172 billion (-31%), and Reclamation and CUP by $462 million (-29%). Congress did not enact similar reductions included in the FY2018 and FY2019 budget requests. The FY2020 budget request also includes proposals to repeal the borrowing authority for WAPA's Transmission Infrastructure Program, which facilitates the delivery of renewable energy resources, and to eliminate the statutory requirement that PMAs limit rates to amounts necessary to recover only construction, operations, and maintenance costs; the budget proposes that the PMAs instead transition to a market-based approach to setting rates. These proposals have generated controversy during congressional consideration of the Energy and Water Development appropriations for FY2020. The issues described in this section—listed approximately in the order the affected agencies appear in the Energy and Water Development bill—were selected based on the total funding involved, the percentage of proposed increases or decreases, and potential impact on broader public policy considerations.

The largest reductions would be from USACE Operation and Maintenance (-48%) and Reclamation's Water and Related Resources account (-31%). Similar reductions proposed by the Administration for FY2019 were not enacted. Power Marketing Administration (PMA) Reforms. DOE's FY2020 budget request includes mandatory proposals to sell PMA electricity transmission lines and other assets, repeal certain PMA borrowing authority, and eliminate cost-based limits on the electricity rates charged by the PMAs. The proposals would need to be enacted in authorizing legislation. Termination of Energy Efficiency Grants. DOE's Weatherization Assistance Program and State Energy Program would be terminated under the FY2020 budget request. The Administration had proposed to eliminate the grants in FY2018 and FY2019, but Congress continued funding. Reductions in Energy Research and Development. Under the FY2020 budget request, DOE research and development appropriations would be reduced for energy efficiency and renewable energy (EERE) by 83%, nuclear energy by 38%, and fossil energy by 24%. Similar reductions proposed by the Administration for FY2019 were not enacted. Nuclear Waste Repository. The Administration's budget request would provide new funding for the first time since FY2010 for a proposed nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, NV. DOE would receive $116 million to seek an NRC license for the repository and develop interim waste storage capacity. NRC would receive $38.5 million to consider DOE's repository license application. Similar Administration funding requests for FY2018 and FY2019 were not enacted. Elimination of Advanced Research Projects Agency—Energy (ARPA-E). The Trump Administration proposes no new appropriations for ARPA-E in FY2020 and to cancel $287 million in unobligated balances from previous appropriations. Similar proposals to terminate ARPA-E in FY2018 and FY2019 were not enacted. Loan Programs Termination. The FY2020 budget request would terminate DOE's Title 17 Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program, the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, and the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program. Administration proposals to eliminate the programs were not included in the enacted appropriations measures for FY2018 and FY2019. Weapons Activities. The FY2020 budget request for DOE Weapons Activities is 12% greater than it was in FY2019 ($12.4 billion vs. $11.1 billion), in contrast to a proposed 10% reduction in DOE's total funding. Notable proposed increases would be used for warhead life extension programs and preparations for increase production of plutonium pits (warhead cores)."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8323}

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nFirst, the PSOB program provides cash benefits to public safety officers who are killed or permanently disabled in the line of duty. The PSOEA program offers educational assistance to the children and spouses of such officers. Both are administered by the DOJ's Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA). Funding comes from the annual Appropriations Act, with specific amounts for FY2019: $359,316 lump-sum for death/disability and $1,224 monthly for PSOEA. These amounts are indexed to the cost of living.\n\nEligibility for PSOB includes law enforcement, firefighters, chaplains in public agencies, FEMA employees, and emergency medical services members. There's no minimum service time. The definition of a public agency is broad, covering federal, state, local, and tribal entities. For law enforcement, it's anyone involved in crime control or enforcement, including police, corrections, probation, etc. Firefighters include both professional and volunteer members. Chaplains must be part of a legally organized volunteer fire or police department and performing duties in an emergency. FEMA and emergency management employees are eligible if they are working on a disaster or emergency declared under the Stafford Act and the activity is considered hazardous by FEMA or the agency head.\n\nThe PSOB program covers injuries sustained in the line of duty, which includes authorized activities while on duty, responding to emergencies, or commuting in an authorized vehicle. The injury must be a physical wound or condition caused by external factors, not occupational diseases or stress-related conditions. However, cardiovascular deaths during emergencies are presumed to be from personal injuries. The benefits are paid in addition to other compensation, but there are offsets for certain programs like FECA or the VCF.\n\nFor PSOEA, the program provides educational assistance to the spouse or children of a deceased or disabled officer. The spouse must have been married at the time of the officer's death or injury. Children are eligible until age 27, with possible extensions. The benefits are used for education costs, and the amount is tied to the GI Bill DEA program. The PSOEA benefits are also indexed annually.\n\nEligibility for benefits is based on the officer's status and the nature of the injury.", "answers": ["The Public Safety Officers' Benefits (PSOB) program provides cash benefits to federal, state, and local law enforcement officers; firefighters; employees of emergency management agencies; and members of emergency medical services agencies who are killed or permanently and totally disabled as the result of personal injuries sustained in the line of duty. The Public Safety Officers' Educational Assistance (PSOEA) program, a component of the PSOB program, provides higher-education assistance to the children and spouses of public safety officers killed or permanently disabled in the line of duty. The PSOB and PSOEA programs are administered by the Department of Justice (DOJ), Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA). However, claimants dissatisfied with denials of benefits may pursue administrative appeals within DOJ and may seek judicial review before the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Each year, Congress appropriates funding for PSOB death benefits, which is considered mandatory spending, and for PSOB disability benefits and PSOEA benefits, which is subject to annual appropriations. For FY2019, the one-time lump-sum PSOB death and disability benefit is $359,316 and the PSOEA monthly benefit for a student attending an educational institution full-time is $1,224. In FY2017, the DOJ approved 399 claims for PSOB death benefits, 82 claims for PSOB disability benefits, and 601 claims for PSOEA benefits."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2857}
{"pred": " The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a division of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is responsible for disease prevention, environmental health, and public health education. The agency also leads national efforts to detect, respond to, and prevent illnesses and injuries from natural causes or the release of biological, chemical, or radiological agents. To achieve its mission, the CDC relies on partnerships with public health associations, state and local public health agencies, and international collaborators. The agency has a large workforce of approximately 20,000 employees, both in the United States and abroad, and a budget of around $12 billion for fiscal year 2017. The CDC uses information technology to support its mission and administrative needs, with approximately 750 systems dedicated to public health science, practice, and administration. The agency has a comprehensive information security program, with the Chief Information Officer (CIO) responsible for establishing and enforcing policies and procedures protecting information resources. The CIO is to lead the efforts to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information and systems that support the agency and its operations, and is to report quarterly to the HHS CIO on the overall effectiveness of CDC’s information security and privacy program, including the progress of remedial actions. The CIO designated a chief information security officer (CISO), who is to oversee compliance with applicable information security and privacy requirements of the agency. The CISO, among other things, is responsible for providing information security protections commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, and disruption of information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency. The CDC has a process in place to assess risk from an entity-wide perspective, including regular meetings among OCIO and program office staff to discuss policy, threats, and incidents. The agency also had a process for assessing risk to its facilities, but the risk assessments had not been updated in a timely manner. The CDC had developed numerous policies, procedures, and standards that addressed each of the 18 NIST families of security controls. However, these policies sometimes lacked the technical specificity needed to ensure controls were in place. The agency had not consistently implemented access controls, encrypted sensitive data, configured devices securely, or applied patches in a timely manner. The CDC had not effectively implemented logging and monitoring capabilities or assessed security controls. The agency had not consistently implemented incident response capabilities or taken timely corrective actions to remediate identified control deficiencies.

In carrying out its mission, CDC relies on information technology systems to receive, process, and maintain sensitive data. Accordingly, effective information security controls are essential to ensure that the agency's systems and information are protected from misuse and modification. GAO was asked to examine information security at CDC. In June 2018, GAO issued a limited official use only report on the extent to which CDC had effectively implemented technical controls and an information security program to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information on selected information systems. This current report is a public version of the June 2018 report. In addition, for this public report, GAO determined the extent to which CDC has taken corrective actions to address the previously identified security program and technical control deficiencies and related recommendations for improvement. For this report, GAO reviewed supporting documents regarding CDC's actions on previously identified recommendations and interviewed personnel at CDC. As GAO reported in June 2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) implemented technical controls and an information security program that were intended to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information systems and information. However, GAO identified control and program deficiencies in the core security functions related to identifying risk, protecting systems from threats and vulnerabilities, detecting and responding to cyber security events, and recovering system operations (see table below). GAO made 195 recommendations to address these deficiencies. As of August 2018, CDC had made significant progress in resolving many of the security deficiencies by implementing 102 of 184 (about 55 percent) technical control recommendations, and partially implementing 1 of 11 information security program recommendations made in the June 2018 report. The figure shows the status of CDC's efforts to implement the 195 recommendations. Additionally, CDC has created remedial action plans to implement the majority of the remaining open recommendations by September 2019.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this detailed report about the U.S. involvement in the Saudi-led coalition's military operations in Yemen. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report begins by explaining that in March 2015, Saudi Arabia formed a coalition to fight the Houthi movement and former president Ali Abdullah Saleh in Yemen. The U.S. joined this effort, providing logistical and intelligence support without direct military action. A joint U.S.-Saudi planning cell was established to coordinate support. The U.S. also supported UN Resolution 2216, which imposed an arms embargo on the Houthis and demanded their withdrawal from seized areas.\n\nCongress has been actively involved in debating and overseeing U.S. policy in Yemen. They've considered various legislative proposals, such as reducing civilian casualties from coalition operations, improving humanitarian conditions, ending restrictions on aid, combating Iranian support for the Houthis, preserving maritime security in the Bab al Mandab Strait, and supporting continued coalition and U.S. efforts against Al Qaeda and Islamic State forces in Yemen. The conflict is viewed through the lens of a broader regional rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and the U.S. effort to limit Iran's influence. Some lawmakers have also viewed the Yemen conflict as indicative of problems in the U.S.-Saudi relationship, especially after the killing of Jamal Khashoggi in 2018.\n\nCongress has considered but not enacted proposals to curtail or condition U.S. defense sales to Saudi Arabia. The debate over Yemen has also reinvigorated some Members' interest in strengthening the role of Congress in foreign policy vis-à-vis the executive branch. This has led to the use of war powers legislation and the appropriations and authorization processes to curb U.S. military involvement in support of coalition operations.\n\nThe report also discusses the evolution of congressional interest in the Yemen conflict, starting with the initial support for the coalition in 2015, then moving to more critical stances as the humanitarian crisis worsened. There were several instances where lawmakers expressed concerns about civilian casualties, such as the letter from Representative Ted W. Lieu and the group of 10 Members urging President Obama to limit civilian casualties. These actions were part of a broader push to address the humanitarian situation and the U.S. role in the conflict.\n\nThe report also covers the legislative changes related to the Department of Defense's authority to enter into and use acquisition and cross servicing agreements with partner milit", "answers": ["This product provides an overview of the role Congress has played in shaping U.S. policy toward the conflict in Yemen. Summary tables provide information on legislative proposals considered in the 115th and 116th Congresses. Various legislative proposals have reflected a range of congressional perspectives and priorities, including with regard to the authorization of the activities of the U.S. Armed Forces related to the conflict; the extent of U.S. logistical, material, advisory, and intelligence support for the coalition led by Saudi Arabia; the approval, disapproval, or conditioning of U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia; the appropriation of funds for U.S. operations in support of the Saudi-led coalition; the conduct of the Saudi-led coalition's air campaign and its adherence to international humanitarian law and the laws of armed conflict; the demand for greater humanitarian access to Yemen; the call for a wider government assessment of U.S. policy toward Yemen and U.S. support to parties to the conflict; the nature and extent of U.S.-Saudi counterterrorism and border security cooperation; and the role of Iran in supplying missile technology and other weapons to the forces of the Houthi movement. The 116th Congress may continue to debate U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition and Saudi Arabia's conduct of the war in Yemen, where fighting has continued since March 2015. The war has exacerbated a humanitarian crisis in Yemen that began in 2011; presently, the World Food Program reports that 20 million Yemenis face hunger in the absence of sustained food assistance. The difficulty of accessing certain areas of Yemen has made it hard for governments and aid agencies to count the war's casualties. Data collected by the U.S. and European-funded Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) suggest that 60,000 Yemenis have been killed since January 2016. The Trump Administration has opposed various congressional proposals, including initiatives to reject or condition proposed U.S. arms sales or to require an end to U.S. military support to Saudi-led coalition operations in Yemen. Many in Congress have condemned the October 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi government personnel, and in general, the incident appears to have exacerbated existing congressional concerns about Saudi leaders and the pace, scope, and direction of change in the kingdom's policies.
