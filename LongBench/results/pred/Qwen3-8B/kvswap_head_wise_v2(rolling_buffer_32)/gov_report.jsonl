{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to summarize this report about multiyear procurement (MYP) and block buy contracting (BBC) for the Department of Defense. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report explains that MYP and BBC are special contracting mechanisms that Congress allows the DOD to use for certain defense acquisition programs. These mechanisms can potentially reduce weapon procurement costs by a few or several percent compared to the standard annual contracting approach. The report discusses potential issues for Congress regarding the future use of MYP and BBC, including whether to use them more frequently, less frequently, or about as frequently as now. It also mentions the possibility of creating a permanent statute to govern BBC, similar to the one for MYP. Additionally, the report raises the question of whether the Coast Guard should start using MYP and BBC, given that they are part of the DOD and have similar needs.\n\nThe report differentiates between funding approaches and contracting mechanisms. Funding approaches, like traditional full funding, incremental funding, and advance appropriations, determine how DOD can put a program under contract. Contracting mechanisms, such as annual contracting, MYP, and BBC, are the methods DOD uses to contract for the procurement of weapons systems once funding is appropriated by Congress. The use of a particular funding approach in a defense acquisition program does not dictate the use of a particular contracting mechanism. Therefore, defense acquisition programs can be implemented using various combinations of funding approaches and contracting mechanisms.\n\nThe report highlights that MYP and BBC are alternatives to the standard or default approach of annual contracting. Under MYP, DOD uses a single contract for two to five years' worth of procurement of a given kind of item, without having to exercise a contract option for each year after the first year. DOD needs congressional approval for each use of MYP. The report also mentions that BBC is similar to MYP in that it allows for a single contract covering multiple years of procurement, but there is no permanent statute governing BBC, unlike MYP which has one.\n\nPotential savings from MYP range from less than 5% to more than 15%, with many estimates in the 5-10% range. However, actual savings can be difficult to observe or verify due to cost growth during the execution of the contract that was caused by developments independent of the use of MYP rather than annual contracting. The report also states that DOD does not have a formal mechanism for tracking multiyear results against original expectations and makes few", "answers": ["Multiyear procurement (MYP) and block buy contracting (BBC) are special contracting mechanisms that Congress permits the Department of Defense (DOD) to use for a limited number of defense acquisition programs. Compared to the standard or default approach of annual contracting, MYP and BBC have the potential for reducing weapon procurement costs by a few or several percent. Under annual contracting, DOD uses one or more contracts for each year's worth of procurement of a given kind of item. Under MYP, DOD instead uses a single contract for two to five years' worth of procurement of a given kind of item without having to exercise a contract option for each year after the first year. DOD needs congressional approval for each use of MYP. There is a permanent statute governing MYP contracting—10 U.S.C. 2306b. Under this statute, a program must meet several criteria to qualify for MYP. Compared with estimated costs under annual contracting, estimated savings for programs being proposed for MYP have ranged from less than 5% to more than 15%, depending on the particulars of the program in question, with many estimates falling in the range of 5% to 10%. In practice, actual savings from using MYP rather than annual contracting can be difficult to observe or verify because of cost growth during the execution of the contract due to changes in the program independent of the use of MYP rather than annual contracting. BBC is similar to MYP in that it permits DOD to use a single contract for more than one year's worth of procurement of a given kind of item without having to exercise a contract option for each year after the first year. BBC is also similar to MYP in that DOD needs congressional approval for each use of BBC. BBC differs from MYP in the following ways: There is no permanent statute governing the use of BBC. There is no requirement that BBC be approved in both a DOD appropriations act and an act other than a DOD appropriations act. Programs being considered for BBC do not need to meet any legal criteria to qualify for BBC, because there is no permanent statute governing the use of BBC that establishes such criteria. A BBC contract can cover more than five years of planned procurements. Economic order quantity (EOQ) authority—the authority to bring forward selected key components of the items to be procured under the contract and purchase the components in batch form during the first year or two of the contract—does not come automatically as part of BBC authority because there is no permanent statute governing the use of BBC that includes EOQ authority as an automatic feature. BBC contracts are less likely to include cancellation penalties. Potential issues for Congress concerning MYP and BBC include whether to use MYP and BBC in the future more frequently, less frequently, or about as frequently as they are currently used; whether to create a permanent statute to govern the use of BBC, analogous to the permanent statute that governs the use of MYP; and whether the Coast Guard should begin making use of MYP and BBC."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8537}
{"pred": " The report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) examines the sustainment of 12 selected Air Force and Navy fixed-wing aircraft, highlighting significant challenges related to aging, maintenance, and supply support. The report notes that the total operating and support (O&S) costs for these aircraft in fiscal year 2016 amounted to approximately $20 billion. The report highlights that while the Air Force and Navy have established policies and procedures for sustainment planning, many of the aircraft in the review have not met their availability goals. Specifically, 9 of 12 aircraft did not meet availability goals in fiscal year 2016. The report also discusses the various sustainment strategies, including life-cycle sustainment plans, that are required to sustain these aircraft. The report found that the Air Force and Navy have similar sustainment challenges, including aging aircraft, maintenance, and supply support issues. These challenges have led to a decrease in aircraft availability and the aircraft in general not being able to meet availability goals. The report also found that the Air Force and Navy regularly review sustainment metrics for the aircraft and have implemented plans to improve aircraft availability. However, the Department of Defense's policy and the Navy's guidance are not clear on whether the services should have a current sustainment strategy for legacy weapon systems, including fixed-wing aircraft, and whether the strategies are required to be updated every 5 years. The report recommends that the Secretary of Defense clarify the requirements for documenting sustainment strategies for legacy weapon systems, including fixed-wing aircraft, and that the Secretary of the Navy do the same. The report also highlights the importance of sustainment strategies in guiding operations and supporting planning and implementation activities throughout the life cycle of the aircraft. The GAO found that the Air Force and Navy have sustainment strategies for their selected aircraft, but the Navy has not updated the strategies for four of the seven aircraft in their review since 2012. The report concludes that the Air Force and Navy need to clarify their sustainment strategy requirements for legacy systems to ensure the sustainability and affordability of these programs. The GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Navy clarify the requirements for documenting sustainment strategies for legacy weapon systems, including fixed-wing aircraft, and that these strategies are required to be updated every 5 years. The report also found that the Air Force and Navy have sustainment challenges related to aging aircraft, maintenance, and supply support that affect aircraft availability and O&S costs for the 12 aircraft selected in our review. The report", "answers": ["DOD spends billions of dollars annually to sustain its weapon systems to support current and future operations. The Air Force and Navy are operating many of their fixed-wing aircraft well beyond their original designed service lives and therefore are confronted with sustainment challenges. House Report 114-537 included a provision for GAO to evaluate the sustainment of major weapon systems. This report, among other things, (1) examines the trends in availability and O&S costs for selected Air Force and Navy fixed-wing aircraft since fiscal year 2011, including whether they met availability goals, and (2) assesses the extent that the departments documented sustainment strategies, reviewed sustainment metrics, and implemented plans to improve aircraft availability. GAO selected a nongeneralizable sample of 12 fixed-wing aircraft by considering a variety of factors, such as the type, age, and manufacturer of the aircraft, among other factors, and analyzed condition and availability data, O&S costs, and sustainment challenges from fiscal year 2011 through March 2017 for each aircraft in a “Sustainment Quick Look.” GAO also analyzed policies, strategies, and plans, and interviewed Navy and Air Force officials in program offices, squadrons, and maintenance depots. Between fiscal years 2011 and 2016, the Air Force and Navy generally did not meet aircraft availability goals, and operating and support (O&S) cost trends for GAO's selected fixed-wing aircraft varied. Specifically, GAO found that availability declined for 6 of 12 aircraft—3 from each service—between fiscal years 2011 and 2016; availability fell short of goals for 9 of 12 aircraft in fiscal year 2016; and O&S costs increased for 5 of the aircraft, and maintenance costs—the largest share—increased for 8 of 12 aircraft. GAO found, and officials agreed, that these aircraft face similar challenges. a Obsolescence means a part is unavailable due to its lack of usefulness or it is no longer current or available for production. b Diminishing manufacturing sources is a loss or impending loss of manufacturers or suppliers. The Air Force and Navy have documented sustainment strategies for some aircraft, regularly reviewed sustainment metrics, and implemented improvement plans. The Air Force has documented sustainment strategies for all aircraft GAO reviewed; however, the Navy has not documented or updated its sustainment strategies for four aircraft. Specifically, the Navy does not have a documented sustainment strategy for the C-2A, and has not updated the strategies for the E2C, EA-18G, and F/A-18A-D since before 2012. The Navy is in the process of documenting its strategies, but Department of Defense (DOD) policy is unclear on whether a sustainment strategy is required and has to be updated every 5 years for weapon systems that are in the operations and support phase of their life cycle (i.e., legacy systems). Also, Navy guidance does not specify a requirement for legacy systems, although Air Force guidance does. Clarifying the requirements to document sustainment strategies for legacy systems, and documenting those strategies, would add additional visibility over the availability and O&S costs of DOD aircraft and any associated sustainment risks. This is a public version of a sensitive report issued in April 2018. Information on aircraft availability and other related information was deemed to be sensitive and has been omitted from this report.

According to the United Nations and other organizations, the illegal wildlife trade is estimated to range from $7 billion to $23 billion annually, with U.S. law enforcement reports indicating that wildlife trafficking involves a variety of species, including live reptiles, birds, and mammals, as well as elephant ivory. The report also discusses the use of financial rewards to obtain information on wildlife trafficking, noting that while some federal agencies have used this tool, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have not prioritized the use of rewards. The report found that FWS and NOAA have paid few financial rewards for information on wildlife trafficking from fiscal years 2007 through 2017, but agency officials could not provide sufficient assurance that the reward information they provided represented all of their reward payments for this period. The report also discusses the policies and procedures that FWS and NOAA have in place for using financial rewards to obtain information on wildlife trafficking, noting that while NOAA's policy specifies factors for agents to consider in developing proposed reward amounts, FWS's policy does not. The report further discusses the effectiveness of the agencies' use of financial rewards in combating wildlife trafficking, noting that while the agencies have not reviewed the effectiveness of their use of rewards, stakeholders have suggested that the agencies should consider doing so. The report concludes that by tracking reward information so that it is clearly documented and readily available for examination, FWS and NOAA can better ensure that they have complete information on the rewards they have paid to help manage their use of rewards as a law enforcement tool. Additionally, the report recommends that FWS and NOAA officials determine the types of additional information to communicate to the public on financial rewards and then develop and implement a plan for communicating that information. The report also recommends that FWS and NOAA officials review the effectiveness of their use of financial rewards and implement any changes that the agency determines would improve the usefulness of rewards as a law enforcement tool. The report makes seven recommendations, including four to FWS and three to NOAA. The recommendations are aimed at improving the use of financial rewards as a tool for combating wildlife trafficking by ensuring that the agencies have complete information on the rewards they have paid, that the agents have the necessary quality information to make defensible reward decisions, and that the agencies periodically review the effectiveness of their use of financial rewards in combating", "answers": ["Wildlife trafficking—the poaching and illegal trade of plants, fish, and wildlife—is a multibillion-dollar, global criminal activity that imperils thousands of species. FWS and NOAA enforce laws prohibiting wildlife trafficking that authorize the agencies to pay financial rewards for information about such illegal activities. GAO was asked to review FWS's and NOAA's use of financial rewards to combat wildlife trafficking. This report examines (1) laws that authorize FWS and NOAA to pay rewards for information on wildlife trafficking and the extent to which the agencies paid such rewards from fiscal years 2007 through 2017, (2) the agencies' reward policies, (3) information available to the public on rewards, and (4) the extent to which the agencies reviewed the effectiveness of their use of rewards. GAO reviewed laws, examined FWS and NOAA policies and public communications on rewards, analyzed agency reward data for fiscal years 2007 through 2017 and assessed their reliability, interviewed FWS and NOAA officials, and compared agency policies and public communications on rewards to federal internal control standards. Multiple laws—such as the Endangered Species Act and Lacey Act—authorize the Departments of the Interior's U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to pay rewards for information on wildlife trafficking. FWS and NOAA reported paying few rewards from fiscal years 2007 through 2017. Specifically, the agencies collectively reported paying 27 rewards, totaling $205,500. Agency officials said that the information was complete to the best of their knowledge but could not sufficiently assure that this information represented all of their reward payments. FWS and NOAA have reward policies that outline the general process for preparing reward proposals, but FWS's policy does not specify factors for its agents to consider when developing proposed reward amounts. Some FWS agents GAO interviewed said that in developing proposals, they did not know whether their proposed reward amounts were enough, too little, or too much. By augmenting its policy to specify factors for agents to consider, FWS can better ensure that its agents have the necessary quality information to prepare proposed reward amounts, consistent with federal internal control standards. FWS and NOAA communicate little information to the public on rewards. For example, most agency websites did not indicate that providing information on wildlife trafficking could qualify for a reward. This is inconsistent with federal standards that call for management to communicate quality information so that external parties can help achieve agency objectives. FWS and NOAA officials said they have not communicated general reward information because of workload concerns, but they said it may be reasonable to provide more information in some instances. By developing plans to communicate more reward information to the public, the agencies can improve their chances of obtaining information on wildlife trafficking that they otherwise might not receive. FWS and NOAA have not reviewed the effectiveness of their use of rewards. The agencies have not done so because using rewards has generally not been a priority. FWS and NOAA officials agreed that such a review would be worthwhile but provided no plans for doing so. By reviewing the effectiveness of their use of rewards, FWS and NOAA can identify opportunities to improve the usefulness of rewards as a tool for combating wildlife trafficking. GAO is making seven recommendations, including that FWS and NOAA track reward information, FWS augment its reward policy to specify factors for agents to consider when developing proposed reward amounts, FWS and NOAA develop plans to communicate more reward information to the public, and FWS and NOAA review the effectiveness of their reward use.

Such data flows enable people to transmit information for online communication, track global supply chains, share research, provide cross-border services, and support technological innovation. Ensuring open cross-border data flows has been an objective of Congress in recent trade agreements and in broader U.S. international trade policy. The free flow of personal data, however, has raised security and privacy concerns. U.S. trade policy has traditionally sought to balance the need for cross-border data flows, which often include personal data, with online privacy and security. Some stakeholders, including some Members of Congress, believe that U.S. policy should better protect personal data privacy and security, and have introduced legislation to set a national policy. Other policymakers and analysts are concerned about increasing foreign barriers to U.S. digital trade, including data flows. Recent incidents of private information being shared or exposed have heightened public awareness of the risks posed to personal data stored online. Consumers' personal online data is valued by organizations for a variety of reasons, such as analyzing marketing information and easing the efficiency of transactions. Concerns are likely to grow as the amount of online data organizations collect and the level of global data flows expand. As Congress assesses policy options, it may further explore the link between cross-border data flows, online privacy, and trade policy; the trade implications of a comprehensive data privacy policy; and the U.S. role in establishing best practices and binding trade rules that seek to balance public policy priorities. There is no globally accepted standard or definition of data privacy in the online world, and there are no comprehensive binding multilateral rules specifically about cross-border data flows and privacy. Several international organizations, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), G-20, and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, have sought to develop best practice guidelines or principles related to privacy and cross-border data flows, although none are legally binding. U.S. and other recent trade agreements are establishing new enforceable trade rules and disciplines. Countries vary in their data policies and laws; some focus on limiting access to online information by restricting the flow of data beyond a country's borders, aiming to protect domestic interests (e.g., constituents' privacy). However, these policies can also act as protectionist measures. The EU and China, two top U.S. trading partners, have established prescriptive rules on cross-border data flows and personal data from different perspectives. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is driven by privacy concerns; China is focused on security. Their policies affect U.S. firms seeking to do business in those regions, as well as in other markets that emulate the EU and Chinese approaches. Unlike the EU or China, the United States does not broadly restrict cross-border data flows and has traditionally regulated privacy at a sectoral level to cover data, such as health records. U.S. trade policy has sought to balance the goals of consumer privacy, security, and open commerce. The proposed United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) represents the Trump Administration's first attempt to include negotiated trade rules and disciplines on privacy, cross-border data flows, and security in a trade agreement. While the United States and other countries work to define their respective national privacy strategies, many stakeholders seek a more global approach that would allow interoperability between differing national regimes to facilitate and remove discriminatory trade barriers to cross-border data flows; this could offer an opportunity for the United States to lead the global conversation. Although Congress has examined issues surrounding online privacy and has considered multiple bills, there is not yet consensus on a comprehensive U.S. online data privacy policy.

{"pred": " The report outlines the federal government's role in supporting airport infrastructure through three primary mechanisms: the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), the Passenger Facility Charge (PFC), and tax-exempt bonds. The AIP provides federal grants for planning and capital projects related to aircraft operations, such as runways and taxiways, with a minimum federal share of 75% for most projects. Airports can also use PFCs, which are local fees on each boarding passenger, to fund a broader range of projects, including landside infrastructure like terminals and transit systems. The report details the legislative history of these programs, starting with the Federal Airport Act of 1946, which established the first federal aid to airports. The Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970 created the forerunner programs of AIP, while the Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1970 established the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. The 1982 Airport and Airway Improvement Act created the current AIP and reactivated the trust fund. The report also discusses the various funding sources for airport projects, including state and local grants, operating revenues, and the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. The trust fund is primarily funded by aviation-related taxes, including the 7.5% ticket tax, $4.20 flight segment tax, 6.25% tax on cargo waybills, and others. The report highlights the importance of federal funding in ensuring airport safety, capacity, and noise mitigation, as well as the role of various funding sources in meeting national airport needs. The report also discusses the legislative history of the PFC, including the 1990 legislation that allowed airports to impose a PFC on each boarding passenger, with a $3 cap on each airport's PFC and a $12 limit on the total PFCs that a passenger could be charged per round trip. The report also discusses the various funding sources for airport projects, including the use of AIP funds for \"airside\" projects such as runways, taxiways, aprons, navigation aids, lighting, and airside safety projects, as well as state block grants and noise planning and abatement. The report also discusses the use of PFC revenues for interest payments and the potential for using PFCs to fund off-airport projects, such as transportation access projects. The report also discusses the use of PFCs to fund projects that are not directly related to airport operations, such as those that are", "answers": ["There are five major sources of airport capital development funding: the federal Airport Improvement Program (AIP); local passenger facility charges (PFCs) imposed pursuant to federal law; tax-exempt bonds; state and local grants; and airport operating revenue from tenant lease and other revenue-generating activities such as landing fees. Federal involvement is most consequential in AIP, PFCs, and tax-exempt financing. The AIP has been providing federal grants for airport development and planning since the passage of the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 (P.L. 97-248). AIP funding is usually spent on projects that support aircraft operations such as runways, taxiways, aprons, noise abatement, land purchase, and safety or emergency equipment. The funds obligated for AIP are drawn from the airport and airway trust fund, which is supported by a variety of user fees and fuel taxes. Different airports use different combinations of these sources depending on the individual airport's financial situation and the type of project being considered. Although smaller airports' individual grants are of much smaller dollar amounts than the grants going to large and medium hub airports, the smaller airports are much more dependent on AIP to meet their capital needs. This is particularly the case for noncommercial airports, which received over 25% of AIP grants distributed in FY2018. Larger airports are much more likely to issue tax-exempt bonds or finance capital projects with the proceeds of PFCs. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-254) provided annual AIP funding of $3.35 billion from the airport and airway trust fund for five years from FY2019 to FY2023. The act left the basic structure of AIP unchanged, but authorized supplemental annual funding of over $1 billion from the general fund to the AIP discretionary funds, starting with $1.02 billion in FY2019, and required at least 50% of the additional discretionary funds to be available to nonhub and small hub airports. The act included a provision permitting eligible projects at small airports (including those in the State Block Grant Program) to receive a 95% federal share of project costs (otherwise capped at 90%), if such projects are determined to be successive phases of a multiphase construction project that received a grant in FY2011. The 2018 reauthorization expanded the number of states that could participate in the State Block Grant Program from 10 to 20 and also expanded the existing airport privatization pilot program (now renamed the Airport Investment Partnership Program) to include more than 10 airports. The law included a provision that forbids states or local governments from levying or collecting taxes on a business at an airport that \"is not generally imposed on sales or services by that State, political subdivision, or authority unless wholly utilized for airport or aeronautical purposes.\" The airport improvement issues Congress generally faces in the context of FAA reauthorization include the following: Should airport development funding be increased or decreased? Should the $4.50 ceiling on PFCs be eliminated, raised, or kept as it is? Could AIP be restructured to address congestion at the busiest U.S. airports, or should a large share of AIP resources continue to go to noncommercial airports that lack other sources of funding? Should Congress set tighter limits on the purposes for which AIP and PFC funds may be spent?

The report also discusses the process through which the active component obligates its appropriations throughout the period in which the appropriation is available. The report highlights the importance of reliable cost estimates for DOD's MILCON projects, as these estimates are the basis for DOD's requests for appropriations. The report also discusses the process through which DOD's MILCON cost estimates are developed, including the use of the Unified Facilities Criteria and the military departments' own guidance. The report finds that the cost estimates are not reliable, and DOD's cost estimating guidance does not fully incorporate all the steps needed for producing reliable estimates. The report recommends that DOD improve its MILCON cost estimating guidance by fully incorporating all the steps needed for developing high-quality, reliable cost estimates. The report concludes that until DOD incorporates all the steps needed for developing high-quality, reliable cost estimates into its department-wide construction criteria, DOD and congressional decision-makers may not have reliable estimates to inform their decisions regarding appropriations and the oversight of projects.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points. The report is about the DOD's MILCON appropriations, which fund various construction projects both in the US and overseas. It explains the process of requesting and allocating these funds, including the use of Form 1391. There's a lot about the funding availability period, which is 5 years, and after that, the funds are canceled. The report also talks about reprogramming funds, which can be used for different projects, but there are some restrictions. DOD officials mention that reprogramming above a certain threshold requires congressional approval, while below-threshold reprogramming doesn't. The report also discusses the Unified Facilities Criteria, which are DOD-wide technical manuals and standards for planning, designing, constructing, restoring, and maintaining DOD facility projects. The report highlights that the cost estimates are not reliable, and the DOD's cost estimating guidance does not fully incorporate all the steps", "answers": ["Between fiscal years 2005 and 2016, Congress annually appropriated between $2.5 to $9.6 billion in MILCON funding for the active component of the U.S. military to use for projects worldwide. Reliable project construction cost estimates are of great importance, since those estimates drive these appropriations. House Report 114-537 accompanying a proposed bill authorizing national defense activities for fiscal year 2017 included a provision for GAO to report on DOD's MILCON cost estimating. This report examines the extent to which (1) the active component obligated and expended the MILCON appropriations received during fiscal years 2005-2016, (2) the active component reprogrammed MILCON appropriations during fiscal years 2010 through 2016, and (3) DOD's MILCON cost estimates are reliable for selected projects and DOD's guidance for developing estimates fully incorporates the steps needed for developing reliable estimates. GAO analyzed the active components' MILCON execution data and reviewed DOD's guidance for cost estimating and compared it with the best practices identified in GAO's Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide . During fiscal years 2005 through 2016, Congress appropriated about $66 billion in military construction funds (MILCON) to the active duty Army, Navy, and Air Force (referred to as the active component) for projects. As of September 30, 2016, the active component had obligated all but about $5.1 billion and expended all but about $11 billion of those funds. Of the $5.1 billion remaining unobligated, about $4.6 billion was still available to be obligated because MILCON appropriations are generally available for new obligations for 5 years. According to Department of Defense (DOD) officials, available but unobligated amounts no longer needed may be either taken back by Congress or reprogrammed to other MILCON projects that the active component identifies as needing additional funding. During fiscal years 2010 through 2016, the active component reprogrammed about $1.6 billion in MILCON appropriations to fund emergency projects, projects that were authorized but did not receive specific appropriations, and projects needing additional funding. Of this amount, the Army reprogrammed about $789 million; the Navy, about $535 million; and the Air Force, about $295 million. DOD's guidance does not fully incorporate the steps needed for developing reliable estimates and the estimates for three projects that GAO reviewed were not reliable. Specifically, two of the three high-value projects GAO examined experienced a more than 30-percent increase from the initial cost estimates submitted to Congress. GAO determined that DOD cost estimators did not follow all the best practices associated with the four characteristics—comprehensive, well-documented, accurate, and credible—of a reliable estimate for these projects. GAO's Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide identifies 12 steps that, if used, are more likely to result in reliable and valid cost estimates. However, as shown below, DOD's construction guidance—the Unified Facilities Criteria—does not include all of these steps. Until DOD incorporates these steps, DOD and congressional decision-makers may not have reliable estimates to inform their decisions regarding appropriations and the oversight of projects. GAO recommends that DOD ensure that its cost estimating guidance fully incorporate the steps needed for developing reliable cost estimates. DOD partially concurred with GAO's recommendation and stated that it will issue revised cost guidance in fiscal year 2019 that more fully incorporates those steps that would benefit the military construction program."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6142}

Schools that don't meet these standards are subject to more oversight. Compliance audits are required annually by an independent auditor and are submitted with the school's audited financial statements. \n\nThe OIG (Office of Inspector General) is responsible for assessing the quality of these compliance audits. They select samples to review each year, checking if the audit documentation supports the auditor's opinions and if the audit results are reliable. The report mentions that FSA staff should refer compliance audits to the OIG for quality review if they have concerns about the audit's quality. \n\nThe report also discusses the certification process. When schools first apply, FSA can approve them for provisional certification (usually 1 year) or deny certification. For recertification, FSA may provisionally or fully recertify or deny. Provisional certification is used for new schools or those not fully compliant. \n\nThe report includes data on certification outcomes from 2006 to 2017. For example, 89% of new schools were provisionally certified, and 11% were denied. The denial rates varied by school type. \n\nThe report highlights issues with the quality of compliance audits. The OIG found that some audits had significant quality issues, such as lack of evidence that the auditor tested student enrollment status, or that the auditor verified student attendance. \n\nThe report also mentions that FSA and OIG have taken steps to improve audit quality. These include training for auditors, guidance on selecting an auditor, and revisions to audit guides. \n\nThe summary needs to be concise, covering the key points of the report. I should mention the three requirements for schools to participate in federal student aid programs, the role of FSA in ensuring compliance, the process of certification and recertification, the importance of compliance audits,", "answers": ["Education provided over $122 billion in grants, loans and work study funds to help students pay for college at about 6,000 schools in fiscal year 2017. Education is responsible for certifying that these schools are eligible for and capable of properly administering federal student aid funds. Schools are required to submit an annual compliance audit that provides information on schools' administrative capability, which Education considers in its school certification decisions. GAO was asked to review Education's process for certifying schools to receive federal student aid. This report examines (1) how Education certifies schools to administer federal student aid and how frequently schools are approved and denied certification; and (2) the role of compliance audits in the certification process and what, if any, steps Education has taken to address the quality of the audit information. GAO analyzed data on school certification outcomes for calendar years 2006-2017 (when GAO determined data were most reliable); reviewed data and reports summarizing Education's reviews of compliance audit quality for fiscal years 2006-2017; reviewed a non-generalizable sample of 21 school certification decisions from fiscal years 2015 and 2016, selected for a mix of decisions, school characteristics, and geographic regions; examined relevant federal laws, regulations, policy manuals and guidance; and interviewed Education officials. The Department of Education (Education) is responsible for evaluating a variety of information to determine whether a postsecondary school should be certified to administer federal student aid programs, and agency data show that it approves most schools that apply. Education procedures instruct regional office staff to review school policies, financial statements, and compliance audits prepared by independent auditors, among other things. Education can certify schools to participate in federal student aid programs for up to 6 years, or it can provisionally certify them for less time if it determines that increased oversight is needed—for example, when a school applies for certification for the first time or when it has met some but not all requirements to be fully certified. In calendar years 2006 through 2017, Education fully or provisionally approved most schools applying for initial or recertification to receive federal student aid (see figure). Note: Schools applying for certification for the first time and approved are placed in provisional certification. In deciding whether to certify schools, Education particularly relies on compliance audits for direct information about how well schools are administering federal student aid, and Education's offices of Federal Student Aid and Inspector General have taken steps to address audit quality. The Inspector General annually selects a sample of compliance audits for quality reviews based on risk factors, such as auditors previously cited for errors. In fiscal years 2006 through 2017, 59 percent of the 739 selected audits received failing scores. Audits that fail must be corrected; if not, the school generally must repay federal student aid covered by the audit. Because higher risk audits are selected for review, Inspector General officials said they cannot assess the overall prevalence of quality problems in compliance audits. These two Education offices have taken steps to improve audit quality. For example, the Inspector General offered additional training to auditors on its revised 2016 audit guide and provided guidance to schools on hiring an auditor, while Federal Student Aid created a working group to strengthen its procedures for addressing poor quality compliance audits. Education's efforts to address audit quality could help ensure that these audits provide reliable information for school certification decisions.

{"pred": " The report highlights the persistent cybersecurity threats facing federal agencies and the information they manage. According to the Office of Management and Budget's 2018 annual FISMA report, agencies reported 35,277 information security incidents to the Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) in fiscal year 2017. These incidents involved various threat vectors, such as web-based attacks, phishing attacks, and the loss or theft of computer equipment, among others. These incidents can pose a serious challenge to economic, national, and personal privacy and security. The report provides examples of the impact of such incidents, including the Department of Justice indicting nine Iranians for conducting a massive cybersecurity theft campaign on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which allegedly stole over 31 terabytes of data from more than 140 American universities, 30 U.S. companies, and 5 federal government agencies. In March 2018, a joint alert from DHS and the Federal Bureau of Investigation stated that, since at least March 2016, Russian government actors had targeted U.S. government entities and critical infrastructure sectors, including the energy, nuclear, water, aviation, and critical manufacturing sectors. In June 2015, the Office of Personnel Management reported that an intrusion into its systems had affected the personnel records of about 4.2 million current and former federal employees. Then, in July 2015, the agency reported that a separate but related incident had compromised its systems and the files related to background investigations for at least 21.5 million individuals. The report outlines the federal approach and strategy for securing information systems, which is governed by federal law and policy, including the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA), Executive Order 13800, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity. FISMA requires agencies to implement information security protections to prevent unauthorized access to their systems and information. The report also discusses the Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015, which requires DHS to develop and implement an intrusion assessment plan to proactively detect, identify, and remove intruders in agency information systems on a routine basis. The act also requires that the plan be updated as necessary. In December 2016, DHS documented its Intrusion Assessment Plan. In the plan, DHS outlined tools,", "answers": ["Federal agencies are dependent on information systems to carry out operations. The risks to these systems are increasing as security threats evolve and become more sophisticated. To reduce the risk of a successful cyberattack, agencies can deploy intrusion detection and prevention capabilities on their networks and systems. GAO first designated federal information security as a government-wide high-risk area in 1997. In 2015, GAO expanded this area to include protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information. Most recently, in September 2018, GAO updated the area to identify 10 critical actions that the federal government and other entities need to take to address major cybersecurity challenges. The federal approach and strategy for securing information systems is grounded in the provisions of the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 and Executive Order 13800. The act requires agencies to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide program to secure their information systems. The Executive Order, issued in May 2017, directs agencies to use the National Institute of Standards and Technology's cybersecurity framework to manage cybersecurity risks. The Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015 contained a provision for GAO to report on the effectiveness of the government's approach and strategy for securing its systems. GAO determined (1) the reported effectiveness of agencies' implementation of the government's approach and strategy; (2) the extent to which DHS and OMB have taken steps to facilitate the use of intrusion detection and prevention capabilities to secure federal systems; and (3) the extent to which agencies reported implementing capabilities to detect and prevent intrusions. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed OMB reports related to agencies' information security practices including OMB's annual report to Congress for fiscal year 2017. GAO also analyzed and summarized agency-reported security performance metrics and IG-reported information for the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies. In addition, GAO evaluated plans, reports, and other documents related to DHS intrusion detection and prevention programs, and interviewed OMB, DHS, and agency officials. The 23 civilian agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO Act) have often not effectively implemented the federal government's approach and strategy for securing information systems (see figure below). Until agencies more effectively implement the government's approach and strategy, federal systems will remain at risk. To illustrate: As required by Office of Management and Budget (OMB), inspectors general (IGs) evaluated the maturity of their agencies' information security programs using performance measures associated with the five core security functions—identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. The IGs at 17 of the 23 agencies reported that their agencies' programs were not effectively implemented. IGs also evaluated information security controls as part of the annual audit of their agencies' financial statements, identifying material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal controls for financial reporting at 17 of the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies. Chief information officers (CIOs) for 17 of the 23 agencies reported not meeting all elements of the government's cybersecurity cross-agency priority goal. The goal was intended to improve cybersecurity performance through, among other things, maintaining ongoing awareness of information security, vulnerabilities, and threats; and implementing technologies and processes that reduce malware risk. Executive Order 13800 directed OMB, in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), to assess and report on the sufficiency and appropriateness of federal agencies' processes for managing cybersecurity risks. Using performance measures for each of the five core security functions, OMB determined that 13 of the 23 agencies were managing overall enterprise risks, while the other 10 agencies were at risk. In assessing agency risk by core security function, OMB identified a few agencies to be at high risk (see figure at the top of next page). DHS and OMB facilitated the use of intrusion detection and prevention capabilities to secure federal agency systems, but further efforts remain. For example, in response to prior GAO recommendations, DHS had improved the capabilities of the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS), which is intended to detect and prevent malicious traffic from entering agencies' computer networks. However, the system still had limitations, such as not having the capability to scan encrypted traffic. The department was also in the process of enhancing the capabilities of federal agencies to automate network monitoring for malicious activity through its Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program. However, the program was running behind schedule and officials at most agencies indicated the need for additional training and guidance. Further, the Federal CIO issued a mandated report assessing agencies' intrusion detection and prevention capabilities, but the report did not address required information, such as the capability of NCPS to detect advanced persistent threats, and a cost/benefit comparison of capabilities to commercial technologies and tools. Selected agencies had not consistently implemented capabilities to detect and prevent intrusions into their computer networks. Specifically, the agencies told GAO that they had not fully implemented required actions for protecting email, cloud services, host-based systems, and network traffic from malicious activity. For example, 21 of 23 agencies had not, as of September 2018, sufficiently enhanced email protection through implementation of DHS' directive on enhanced email security. In addition, less than half of the agencies that use cloud services reported monitoring these services. Further, most of the selected 23 agencies had not fully implemented the tools and services available through the first two phases of DHS's CDM program. Until agencies more thoroughly implement capabilities to detect and prevent intrusions, federal systems and the information they process will be vulnerable to malicious threats. GAO is making two recommendations to DHS, to among other things, coordinate with agencies to identify additional needs for training and guidance. GAO is also making seven recommendations to OMB to, among other things, direct the Federal CIO to update the mandated report with required information, such as detecting advanced persistent threats. DHS concurred with GAO's recommendations. OMB did not indicate whether it concurred with the recommendations or not."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12551}

The report is about USAID's assistance to the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, specifically through the ESF (Emergency Support Fund) from fiscal years 2015 and 2016. \n\nFirst, the report mentions that since 1993, USAID has obligated over $5 billion in bilateral assistance to the Palestinians, primarily through the ESF. The ESF is used for project assistance and debt relief payments to PA creditors. USAID implements most of these programs under the guidance of the State Department, focusing on areas like private sector development, health, water and road infrastructure, local governance, civil society, rule of law, education, and youth development. The goal is to build a more democratic, stable, prosperous, and secure Palestinian society, which USAID claims is in the interest of Palestinians, the United States, and Israel.\n\nThe report also discusses USAID's antiterrorism policies, specifically Mission Order 21, which outlines procedures to ensure that assistance does not inadvertently support entities or individuals associated with terrorism. USAID officials stated that the assistance to the West Bank and Gaza contributes to building a more democratic, stable, prosperous, and secure Palestinian society—a goal that USAID described as being in the interest of the Palestinians, the United States, and Israel.\n\nThe report then provides details on the status of ESF assistance to the Palestinians and USAID's antiterrorism policies and procedures in the West Bank and Gaza. It mentions that as of March 31, 2018, USAID had obligated about $544.1 million (over 99 percent) and expended about $350.6 million (over 64 percent) of approximately $544.5 million in ESF assistance allocated for the West Bank and Gaza in fiscal years 2015 and 2016. The majority of the funds were used for project assistance, with the remaining for direct payments to PA creditors. \n\nThe report breaks down the assistance into three main objectives: Economic Growth and Infrastructure, Investing in the Next Generation, and Governance and Civic Engagement. For each objective, it provides the amount obligated and the percentage of expenditure. The largest share was Economic Growth and Infrastructure, followed by Investing in the Next Generation, and the smallest was Governance and Civic Engagement. \n\nThe report also", "answers": ["Since 1993, the U.S. government has committed more than $5 billion in bilateral assistance to the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. According to the Department of State, this assistance to the Palestinians promotes U.S. economic and political foreign policy interests by supporting Middle East peace negotiations and financing economic stabilization programs. USAID is primarily responsible for administering ESF assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. Appropriations acts for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 included provisions for GAO to review the treatment, handling, and uses of funds provided through the ESF for assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. This report examines (1) the status of ESF assistance and projects provided to the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016, including project assistance and payments to PA creditors, and (2) the extent to which USAID conducted required vetting of PA creditors to ensure that this assistance would not support entities or individuals associated with terrorism and assessed PA ministries' capacity to use ESF assistance as intended. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations and USAID financial data, policies, procedures, and documents. GAO also interviewed USAID and State Department officials. As of March 2018, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) had allocated about $545 million of funding appropriated to the Economic Support Fund (ESF) for assistance in the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016. USAID obligated about $544 million (over 99 percent) and expended about $351 million (over 64 percent) of the total allocations. Project assistance accounted for approximately $399 million of the obligated funds, while payments to Palestinian Authority (PA) creditors accounted for $145 million (see figure). USAID's obligations for project assistance in the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 supported three development objectives—Economic Growth and Infrastructure ($239 million), Investing in the Next Generation ($107 million), and Governance and Civic Engagement (about $25 million). In fiscal years 2015 and 2016, USAID made payments directly to PA creditors—two Israeli fuel companies, to cover debts for petroleum purchases, and a local Palestinian bank, to pay off a line of credit used for PA medical referrals to six hospitals in the East Jerusalem Hospital network. USAID vetted PA creditors to ensure that the program assistance would not provide support to entities or individuals associated with terrorism and also conducted external assessments and financial audits of PA ministries of Health and Finance and Planning. USAID documentation showed that, as required, officials checked the vetting status of each PA creditor within 12 months before USAID signed its debt relief grant agreements with the PA. In addition, although USAID determined that it was not legally required to assess the PA Ministry of Health's medical referral services and the Ministry of Finance and Planning's petroleum procurement system, the agency commissioned external assessments of both ministries. These assessments found some weaknesses in both ministries' systems; however, USAID mission officials stated that these weaknesses did not affect USAID debt relief payments to the PA creditors. Nevertheless, USAID took additional steps to mitigate the identified weaknesses. For example, a USAID contractor worked with the Ministry of Health to update, revise, and approve guidelines for medical referrals. In addition, USAID commissioned financial audits of the debt relief grant agreements between USAID and the PA for direct payments to PA creditors in fiscal year 2015 and 2016. The audits did not identify any ineligible costs, reportable material weaknesses in internal control, or material instances of noncompliance with the terms of the agreements.

{"pred": " The report discusses the importance of small business access to capital, highlighting the role of small businesses in net job growth during previous economic recoveries, particularly in the construction, housing, and retail sectors. For example, after the eight-month recession that began in July 1990 and ended in March 1991, small businesses (defined for this purpose as having fewer than 500 employees) increased their net employment in the first year after the recession, whereas larger businesses continued to experience declines in employment. During the most recent recession (December 2007-June 2009), small businesses accounted for almost 60% of net job losses. From the end of the recession through the end of FY2012, small businesses accounted for about 63% of net new jobs, close to their historical average share of net new job creation. Since then, small businesses have added about 65% of net new jobs. Some have argued that the federal government should provide additional resources to assist small businesses. Others worry about the long-term adverse economic effects of spending programs that increase the federal deficit. They advocate business tax reduction, reform of financial credit market regulation, and federal fiscal restraint as the best means to assist small businesses and create jobs. Several laws were enacted during the 111th Congress to enhance small business access to capital. For example, P.L. 111-5, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), provided the Small Business Administration (SBA) an additional $730 million, including $375 million to temporarily subsidize SBA fees and increase the 7(a) loan guaranty percentage from 85% on loans of $150,000 or less and 75% on loans exceeding $150,000 to 90% for all regular 7(a) loans. P.L. 111-240, the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a $30 billion Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) ($4.0 billion was issued) to encourage community banks with less than $10 billion in assets to increase their lending to small businesses.

This report focuses on the SBLF. It opens with a discussion of the supply and demand for small business loans. The SBLF's advocates claimed the SBLF was needed to enhance the supply of small business loans. The report then examines other arguments presented both for and against the program. Advocates argued that the SBLF would increase lending to small businesses and, in turn, create jobs. Opponents contended that the SBLF could lose money, lacked sufficient oversight provisions, did not require lenders to increase their lending to small businesses, could serve as a vehicle for Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients to effectively refinance their TARP loans on more favorable terms with little or no resulting benefit for small businesses, and could encourage a failing lender to make even riskier loans to avoid higher dividend payments. The report concludes with an examination of the program's implementation and a discussion of bills introduced to amend the SBLF. For example, during the 112th Congress, S. 681, the Greater Accountability in the Lending Fund Act of 2011, would have limited the program's authority to 15 years from enactment and prohibited TARP recipients from participating in the program. H.R. 2807, the Small Business Leg-Up Act of 2011, would have transferred any unobligated and repaid funds from the SBLF to the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund \"to increase the availability of credit for small businesses.\" H.R. 3147, the Small Business Lending Extension Act, would have extended the Department of the Treasury's investment authority from one year to two years.

The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget includes funding for the procurement of 12 new ships, including one Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) class aircraft carrier, three Virginia-class attack submarines, three DDG-51 class Aegis destroyers, one FFG(X) frigate, two John Lewis (TAO-205) class oilers, and two TATS towing, salvage, and rescue ships. The report highlights the importance of Congress in deciding whether to approve, reject, or modify the Navy's FY2020 shipbuilding program and its long-term plans. The decisions made by Congress can significantly affect the Navy's capabilities, funding requirements, and the U.S. shipbuilding industrial base. The report also discusses the Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan, which includes the procurement of 304 new ships, or an average of about 10 per year. The report notes that the Navy's 355-ship force-level goal is the result of a Force Structure Assessment (FSA) conducted in 2016, which replaced a 308-ship goal from 2015. The report further explains that the Navy is conducting a new FSA, which may change the 355-ship figure, the planned mix of ships, or both. The report also discusses the potential affordability of the Navy's shipbuilding plans, particularly in the context of the Budget Control Act of 2011, which has led to concerns about the potential impact of the Columbia-class program on funding for other Navy shipbuilding programs.

The 355-ship force-level goal is the result of a Force Structure Assessment (FSA) conducted by the Navy in 2016. The Navy states that a new FSA is now underway as the successor to the 2016 FSA.

{"pred": " The report discusses the Small Business Administration's (SBA) 7(a) loan program, which provides guaranteed loans to small businesses for working capital and other general business purposes. The program is designed to serve creditworthy small business borrowers who cannot obtain credit through a conventional lender at reasonable terms. The SBA relies on lenders with delegated authority to make credit elsewhere determinations, which are critical to the program's success. However, the report highlights significant issues with the current oversight mechanisms, particularly the lack of guidance to lenders on how to document compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement. This has led to a high rate of noncompliance, as evidenced by the 2009 report, which found that SBA's lack of guidance was impeding the agency's ability to oversee compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement. To improve SBA’s oversight of lenders’ compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement, the report recommended in 2009 that SBA issue more detailed guidance to lenders on how to document their compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement. As a result, SBA revised its standard operating procedure to state that each loan file must contain documentation that specifically identifies the factors in the present financing that meet the credit elsewhere test, which we believe met the spirit of our recommendation. The report also discusses disparities in credit access among small businesses, based on characteristics of the borrower and firm. SBA lists as a strategic objective to \"ensure inclusive entrepreneurship by expanding access and opportunity to small businesses and entrepreneurs in communities where market gaps remain.\" In 2007, the report noted that some studies had noted disparities among some races and genders in the conventional lending market, but the studies did not offer conclusive evidence on the reasons for those differences. Recently, the 12 Federal Reserve Banks conducted the Small Business Credit Survey, which found disparities in credit availability based on gender, the age of the firm, and minority status. From fiscal years 2007 through 2016, a majority of loan dollars guaranteed under the 7(a) program went to small businesses that were new, partially or wholly owned by women, or located in a distressed area. The remaining 37 percent of 7(a) loan dollars went to businesses that were established, solely male-owned, and not located in economically distressed areas. Recent studies suggest that certain small business borrowers—including businesses that are new or owned by women—have difficulty obtaining conventional small business loans, which may put them at a disadvantage.

The Joint Explanatory Statement of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 includes a provision for GAO to review the 7(a) program. This report discusses, among other things, (1) how SBA monitors lenders' compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement, (2) the extent to which SBA evaluates trends in lender credit elsewhere practices, and (3) lenders' views on the credit elsewhere criteria for 7(a) loans. GAO analyzed SBA data on 7(a) loans approved for fiscal years 2007–2016, the latest available, and reviewed literature on small business lending; reviewed standard operating procedures, other guidance, and findings from SBA reviews performed in fiscal year 2016; and interviewed lender associations and a nonrepresentative sample of 7(a) lenders selected that concentrated on larger lenders. For its 7(a) loan program, the Small Business Administration (SBA) has largely delegated authority to lenders to make 7(a) loan determinations for those borrowers who cannot obtain conventional credit at reasonable terms elsewhere. To monitor lender compliance with the “credit elsewhere” requirement SBA primarily uses on-site reviews conducted by third-party contractors with SBA participation and oversight, and other reviews. According to SBA guidance, lenders making 7(a) loans must take steps to ensure and document that borrowers meet the program's credit elsewhere requirement. However, GAO noted a number of concerns with SBA's monitoring efforts. Specifically, GAO found the following: Over 40 percent (17 of 40) of the on-site lender reviews performed in fiscal year 2016 identified lender noncompliance with the requirement. On-site reviewers identified several factors, such as weakness in lenders' internal control processes that were the cause for lender noncompliance. Most on-site reviewers did not document their assessment of lenders' policies or procedures, because SBA does not require them to do so. As a result SBA does not have information that could help explain the high noncompliance rate. Federal internal control standards state that management should design control activities, including appropriate documentation, and use quality information to achieve the entity's objectives. Without better information on lenders' procedures for complying with the documentation requirement, SBA may be limited in its ability to promote compliance with requirements designed to help ensure that the 7(a) program reaches its target population. SBA does not routinely collect or analyze information on the criteria used by lenders for credit elsewhere justifications. SBA recently began collecting some information on lenders' use of the criteria, but this information is limited, and SBA does not analyze the information that it does collect to better understand lenders' practices. Federal internal control standards state that management should use quality information to achieve the entity's objectives. Without more robust information and analysis, SBA may be limited in its ability to understand how lenders are using the credit elsewhere criteria and identify patterns of use by certain lenders that place them at a higher risk of not reaching borrowers who cannot obtain credit from other sources at reasonable terms. In general, representatives from 8 of 11 lenders that GAO interviewed stated that SBA's credit elsewhere criteria are adequate for determining small business eligibility for the 7(a) program. These criteria help them target their lending to small businesses that would otherwise have difficulty obtaining conventional credit because they are often new businesses or have a shortage of collateral. However, they also said that other factors—such as lender policies and economic conditions—can affect their decisions to offer 7(a) loans. In January 2018, SBA issued revised guidance for the 7(a) program and has provided training on this new guidance to lenders and trade associations. Lenders told GAO they are still in the process of understanding the new requirements. GAO recommends that SBA (1) require its on-site reviewers to document their assessment of lenders' policies and procedures related to the credit elsewhere documentation requirement, (2) collect information on lenders' use of credit elsewhere criteria, and (3) analyze that information to identify trends.

The benefit of collecting performance information is only fully realized when it is used by managers to make decisions aimed at improving results. GAO was asked to review agencies' use of performance information. This report assesses, among other things, the extent to which: (1) 24 agencies' reported use of performance information and related leading practices has changed since 2013 and (2) the Executive Branch has taken actions to enhance the use of performance information. To address the first objective, GAO analyzed results from its 2017 survey of federal managers, and compared them to 2013 results. The survey covered a stratified random sample of 4,395 managers from the 24 Chief Financial Officers Act agencies. The survey had a 67 percent response rate and results can be generalized to the population of managers government-wide and at each agency. For the second objective, GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed staff from OMB and the PIC. Agencies' reported use of performance information to make decisions, and leading practices that can promote such use, generally has not improved since GAO's last survey of federal managers in 2013. However, GAO's survey results continue to point to certain practices that could help agencies improve managers' use of performance information. For example, as shown in the table below, GAO's survey found that managers whose programs were subject to data-driven reviews (regular reviews used to assess progress on select agency goals) to a greater extent reported statistically significantly greater use of performance information to make decisions. The Executive Branch has begun taking steps to improve the use of performance information within agencies and across the government. For example, In the President's Management Agenda and government-wide reform plan, released in March and June 2018 respectively, the administration acknowledged the need to do more, and announced a goal, among other actions, to improve the use of data in federal decision making. However, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and others responsible for this goal have yet to fully develop action plans to hold agencies accountable for achieving it. The Performance Improvement Council (PIC), which is chaired by OMB, has undertaken efforts to improve the use of performance information by, for example, creating a working group on agency performance reviews. But it has not yet taken a systematic approach to identify and share proven practices that led to, or challenges that may be hampering, increased use of performance information by managers. GAO's survey results identified agencies that may have insights into such practices and challenges. More fully developing action plans for the new goal, and identifying and sharing proven practices and challenges, could help ensure the Executive Branch takes further steps to improve the use of performance information by managers within agencies and across the federal government. To improve the use of performance information within agencies and across the federal government, GAO recommends that OMB work with (1) fellow goal leaders to more fully develop action plans for the new goal to improve the use of data and (2) the PIC to prioritize efforts to identify and share proven practices and challenges.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is about how agencies are using telework to reduce office space and real estate costs, based on the Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 and OMB's Reduce the Footprint policy. \n\nFirst, the Telework Enhancement Act requires agencies to designate a Telework Managing Officer and incorporate telework into their continuity of operations plans. However, the Act doesn't mention telework in the context of space planning. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is tasked with assessing whether agencies have met their telework outcome goals, such as real estate savings. OPM also needs to submit reports that include executive agencies’ goals for increasing telework participation, assist each agency with developing qualitative and quantitative teleworking measures and goals, and track telework eligibility and participation rates across the government.\n\nThe report mentions that from fiscal year 2012 through 2015, the percentage of federal workers eligible to telework remained stable at about 45 percent, on average. However, during the same period, the percentage of eligible employees who participated in telework increased from 29 percent to 46 percent. \n\nThen there's the part about reducing space through OMB's policies, which require agencies to develop Five-Year Real Property Efficiency Plans annually, develop office space standards that specify maximum square footage, identify reduction targets for office space in square feet, and freeze the footprint (i.e., not increase square footage of office space). The report also mentions that OMB's National Strategy noted that employee telework has changed the dynamic of the federal real property portfolio and resulted in a need for less space. \n\nThe report discusses how agencies can use telework, along with other mobility strategies like desk-sharing and hoteling, to reduce space needs and increase efficiency. This allows agencies to plan for fewer workstations than the number of employees. Other space efficiency strategies such as smaller workstations, reconfigured office space, and mobile technology can be combined with telework and used as planning tools to reduce office space, use space more efficiently, and potentially cut costs.\n\nThe report also includes a case study on the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), where they used telework to reduce space. The report found that the percentage of eligible employees who participated in telework increased from 29 percent to ", "answers": ["Federal agencies are exploring ways to use telework as a tool to reduce the federal footprint and use space more efficiently. GAO was asked to examine the effects of telework on agencies' space-planning efforts. In this report, GAO reviewed: (1) how the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies reported using telework in office space planning; (2) the specific ways selected agencies and GSA used telework in their office space planning; and (3) any challenges the civilian CFO Act agencies faced in using telework in office space planning. GAO surveyed all 23 civilian CFO Act agencies, analyzed each agency's space-planning documents, and Real Property Efficiency Plans . GAO reviewed four agencies in greater detail based on analysis of telework data and other factors. For those four agencies GAO conducted site visits, interviewed officials, and analyzed agency documents. GAO also identified challenges agencies faced in using telework in space planning, based on survey results, agency documents, and interviews. The 23 civilian Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act agencies reported various ways of considering and using telework as a space-planning tool, by, for example, implementing desk-sharing for employees who telework in order to relinquish leased space, or increasing the number of staff working in an existing space without increasing its size. All of the 23 agencies discussed telework in the context of space planning and achieving greater space efficiencies in either their space-planning documents or Real Property Efficiency Plans . The agencies that used telework as a space-planning tool generally reported implementing smaller or unassigned workstations. Three of the four agencies GAO reviewed in greater detail––the General Services Administration (GSA); the Office of Justice Programs at the Department of Justice; the Centers for Disease Control at the Department of Health and Human Services; and the Bureau of the Fiscal Service at the Department of the Treasury––leveraged telework to reduce or use office space more efficiently. For example, GSA and the Office of Justice Programs used telework to accommodate more employees in a smaller office space as illustrated in figure 1 below. The Centers for Disease Control used telework to accommodate more employees in the same amount of space. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service reduced space without telework by reducing the size of individual workstations. The 23 civilian CFO Act agencies reported several challenges in using telework to reduce space including human capital issues, mission suitability, and measuring cost savings attributable to telework. About two-thirds of the agencies said they would find it helpful to have additional information, assistance, or resources in using telework as a space-planning tool. GSA provides guidance to improve space utilization. However, GAO found that GSA last developed relevant formal guidance in 2006. This information, and that on GSA's telework and space-planning websites, was neither specific nor detailed and therefore of limited assistance to agencies that would like to use telework as a space-planning tool. Additionally, GSA's space-planning tool—the Workplace Investment and Feasibility Tool, intended to help agencies quantify the benefits and costs of telework––remains under development after more than 4 years, and GSA officials have not decided whether to make the tool available to other federal agencies. As such, agencies reported that they lack adequate guidance to determine how best to reduce space or use it more efficiently, and how to assess the benefits and costs of using telework in space planning. GSA concurred with recommendations that GSA should: (1) develop guidance on how agencies can use telework as a strategic space-planning tool and make this guidance readily available and (2) complete and make the Workplace Investment and Feasibility Tool available to federal agencies for use in assessing the benefits and costs of telework."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6903}

These systems are complex, technologically diverse, and often geographically dispersed, making it difficult to identify, manage, and protect numerous operating systems, applications, and devices. The interconnected nature of these systems increases the number of avenues of attack and expands their attack surface. Cybersecurity incidents continue to impact entities across various critical infrastructure sectors, with the report noting that 53,308 security incidents and 2,216 data breaches were identified in the 12 months since its prior report. The report also highlights the increasing sophistication of hackers and the extent to which both federal agencies and private companies collect sensitive information about individuals, which has increased the risk of PII being exposed and compromised. The report discusses several key challenges, including the need for a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy and effective oversight, the need to secure federal systems and information, and the need to enhance cyber incident response efforts. The report also discusses the need to protect individual's privacy and PII, as well as the need to appropriately limit the collection and use of personal information.

This was expanded to include protecting cyber critical infrastructure in 2003 and protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information in 2015. This report provides an update to the information security high-risk area. To do so, GAO identified the actions the federal government and other entities need to take to address cybersecurity challenges.

{"pred": " The report discusses the establishment of the Office of the Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans (PLCY) under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) following the passage of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) in December 2016. The NDAA elevated the head of the office to an Under Secretary, who is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, and reports directly to the Secretary of Homeland Security. However, as of June 5, 2018, the position had remained vacant, and the President had not nominated an individual to fill the role. According to PLCY officials, elevating the head of the office to an undersecretary was important because it equalized PLCY with other DHS management offices and DHS headquarters components. The NDAA further authorizes, but does not require, the Secretary to establish a position of deputy undersecretary within PLCY. If the position is established, the NDAA provides that the Secretary may appoint a career employee to the position (i.e., not a political appointee). In March 2018, the Secretary named a Deputy Under Secretary, who has been performing the duties of the Deputy Under Secretary and the Under Secretary since then. The report also outlines the structure of PLCY, which is divided into five sub-offices, each with a different focus area. As of June 5, 2018, the top position in these sub-offices was an assistant secretary and two of the five positions were vacant. Additionally, 6 of PLCY’s 12 deputy assistant secretary positions were vacant or filled by acting staff temporarily performing the duties in the absence of permanent staff placement. The NDAA codified many of the functions and responsibilities that PLCY had been carrying out prior to the act’s enactment and, with a few exceptions as discussed later in this report, were largely consistent with the duties the office was already pursuing. According to the act and PLCY officials, one of the office’s fundamental responsibilities is to lead, conduct, and coordinate departmentwide policy development and implementation, and strategic planning. The report identifies four categories of policy and strategy efforts that PLCY leads, conducts, or coordinates: Statutory responsibilities, interagency efforts, Secretary’s priorities, and self-initiated activities. The report also discusses the challenges that PLCY has faced in leading and coordinating departmentwide and crosscutting strategies, including the lack of clearly-defined roles, responsibilities, and mechanisms to implement these responsibilities in a predictable,", "answers": ["GAO has designated DHS management as high risk because of challenges in building a cohesive department. PLCY supports cohesiveness by, among other things, coordinating departmentwide policy and strategy. In the past, however, questions have been raised about PLCY's efficacy. In December 2016, the NDAA codified PLCY's organizational structure, roles, and responsibilities. GAO was asked to evaluate PLCY's effectiveness. This report addresses the extent to which (1) DHS established an organizational structure and processes and procedures that position PLCY to be effective, (2) DHS and PLCY have ensured alignment of workforce with priorities, and (3) PLCY has engaged relevant component staff to help identify and respond to emerging needs. GAO analyzed the NDAA, documents describing specific responsibilities, and departmentwide policies and strategies. GAO also interviewed officials in PLCY and all eight operational components. According to our analysis and interviews with operational components, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans' (PLCY) organizational structure and efforts to lead and coordinate departmentwide and crosscutting strategies—a key organizational objective–have been effective. For example, PLCY's coordination efforts for a strategy and policy executive steering committee have been successful, particularly for strategies. However, PLCY has encountered challenges leading and coordinating efforts to develop, update, or harmonize policies that affect multiple DHS components. In large part, these challenges are because DHS does not have clearly-defined roles and responsibilities with accompanying processes and procedures to help PLCY lead and coordinate policy in a predictable, repeatable, and accountable manner. Until PLCY's roles and responsibilities for policy are more clearly defined and corresponding processes and procedures are in place, situations where the lack of clarity hampers PLCY's effectiveness in driving policy are likely to continue. Development of a delegation of authority, which involves reaching agreement about PLCY's roles and responsibilities and clearly documenting them, had been underway. However, it stalled due to changes in department leadership. As of May 2018, the effort had been revived, but it is not clear whether and when DHS will finalize it. PLCY does some workforce planning as part of its annual budgeting process, but does not systematically apply key principles of the DHS Workforce Planning Guide to help ensure that PLCY's workforce aligns with its and DHS's priorities and goals. According to PLCY officials, the nature of its mission requires a flexible staffing approach. As such, a portion of the staff functions as generalists who can be assigned to meet the needs of different situations, including unexpected changing priorities due to an emerging need. However, shifting short-term priorities requires tradeoffs, which may divert attention and resources from longer-term priorities. As of June 5, 2018, PLCY also had a number of vacancies in key leadership positions, which further limited attention to certain priorities. According to PLCY officials, PLCY recently began a review to identify the office's authorities in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (NDAA) and other statutes, compare these authorities to the current organization and operations, and address any workforce capacity gaps. Employing workforce planning principles—in particular, systematic identification of workforce demand, capacity gaps, and strategies to address them—consistent with the DHS Workforce Planning Guide could better position PLCY to use its workforce as effectively as possible under uncertain conditions and to communicate effectively with DHS leadership about tradeoffs. Officials from PLCY and DHS operational components praised existing mechanisms to coordinate and communicate at the senior level, especially about strategy, but component officials identified opportunities to better connect PLCY and component staff to improve communication flow about emerging policy and strategy needs. Among the ideas offered by component officials to enhance communication and collaboration were holding routine small-group meetings, creating forums for periodic knowledge sharing, and maintaining accurate and up-to-date contact information for all staff-level stakeholders. GAO is making four recommendations. DHS concurred with three recommendations, including that DHS finalize a delegation of authority defining PLCY's roles and responsibilities and develop corresponding processes and procedures.

FEMA is responsible for coordinating the federal response and providing assistance through various programs like IA, Public Assistance, and Hazard Mitigation. The IA program includes five different programs, each with specific purposes. \n\nThe report also discusses the process for requesting a disaster declaration, including the six factors that FEMA considers when evaluating the need for federal assistance. These factors are used to determine the severity, magnitude, and impact of the disaster. However, the report found that FEMA regional offices did not consistently obtain and document all elements of the six factors in their RVARs. \n\nThere are challenges mentioned, such as the subjective nature of the IA factors, lack of eligibility thresholds, and difficulty gathering information on the factors. FEMA is working on revising the factors to make them more objective, but the process is ongoing. \n\nThe report also mentions that FEMA has obligated over $8.6 billion in IA from 2008 to 2016, with significant variations by region and state.

When a state, U.S. territory, or tribe requests IA assistance through a federal disaster declaration, FEMA evaluates the request against regulatory factors, such as concentration of damages, and provides a recommendation to the President, who makes a final declaration decision. GAO was asked to review FEMA's IA declaration process. This report examines (1) the number of IA declaration requests received, declared, and denied, and IA actual obligations from calendar years 2008 through 2016, (2) the extent to which FEMA accounts for the regulatory factors when evaluating IA requests, and (3) any challenges FEMA regions and select states reported on the declaration process and factors and any FEMA actions to revise them. GAO reviewed FEMA's policies, IA declaration requests and obligation data, and FEMA's RVARs from July 2012 through December 2016, the most recent years for which data were available. GAO also reviewed proposed rulemaking comments and interviewed FEMA officials from all 10 regions and 11 state emergency management offices selected based on declaration requests and other factors. From calendar years 2008 through 2016, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Federal Emergency and Management Agency (FEMA) received 294 Individual Assistance (IA) declaration requests from states, U.S. territories, and tribes to help individuals meet their immediate needs after a disaster. Of these, the President declared 168 and denied 126 requests. Across the various types of IA declaration requests, severe storms (190) were the most common disaster type and drought (1) was among the least common. FEMA obligated about $8.6 billion in IA for disaster declarations during this period. GAO found that FEMA regions did not consistently obtain and document information on all elements of established IA regulatory factors when making IA recommendations to headquarters. Following a declaration request, a FEMA region is to prepare a Regional Administrator's Validation and Recommendation (RVAR)—a document designed to include data on each of the six IA regulatory factors for each declaration request as well as the regional administrator's recommendation. GAO reviewed all 81 RVARs from July 2012—the date FEMA began using the new RVAR template—through December 2016. GAO found that regions did not consistently obtain and document information for the elements required under the six regulatory factors (see table). For example, only 44 of the 81 RVARs documented all elements under the concentration of damage factor. By evaluating why regions are not completing all elements of each current IA regulatory factor, FEMA could identify whether any corrective steps are needed. Officials from the 10 FEMA regions and 11 states GAO interviewed, reported positive relationships with each other, but also cited various challenges with the IA declaration process and regulatory factors. For example, these officials told GAO that there are no established minimum thresholds for IA, making final determinations more subjective and the rationale behind denials unclear. However, as required by the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, FEMA has taken steps to revise the IA factors by issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking. According to FEMA, the proposed rule aims to provide more objective criteria, clarify the threshold for eligibility, and speed up the IA declaration process. As of April 2018, the proposed rule was still under consideration. According to FEMA officials, they plan to finalize the rule in late 2018; therefore, it is too early to know the extent to which it will address these challenges.

Further, the Forest Service lacked a process and related control activities to reasonably assure that unobligated no-year appropriation balances from prior years were reviewed for their continuing need; did not have a properly designed system for administrative control of funds, which keeps obligations and expenditures from exceeding limits authorized by law; and had not properly designed control activities for fund transfers to its Wildland Fire Management program.

To carry out its mission, the Forest Service enters into reimbursable agreements with agencies within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), other federal agencies, state and local government agencies, and nongovernment entities. The Forest Service (1) did not have adequately described processes and related control activities in manuals and handbooks for its reimbursable agreement processes and (2) lacked control activities related to segregating incompatible duties performed by line officers and program managers. For example, line officers may be responsible for initiating cost sharing agreements, modifying cost settlement packages, and changing or canceling the related receivable, which represent incompatible duties. As a result, programs and resources may not be protected from waste, fraud, and mismanagement. Unliquidated obligations . The Forest Service's processes and control activities over the review and certification of unliquidated obligations were not properly designed to reasonably assure the best use of funds and that unliquidated obligations would be efficiently and effectively deobligated and made available for other program needs. Further, the current process, as designed, was inconsistent with USDA and Forest Service policy. In addition, the Forest Service's manuals and handbooks, which provide directives for the areas that GAO reviewed, had not been reviewed by management in accordance with the Forest Service's 5-year review policy. Further, standard operating procedures and desk guides prepared by staff to supplement the manuals and handbooks were not issued as directives and therefore were not considered official policy. This increases the risk that control activities may not be consistently performed across the agency. GAO is making 11 recommendations to improve processes and related internal control activities over the management of the Forest Service's budgetary resources, reimbursable receivables and collections, and its process for reviewing unliquidated obligations.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is about the Senate confirmation process for presidential nominations, right?\n\nFirst, the report explains that the Constitution (Article II, Section 2) requires the President to appoint officers with the Senate's advice and consent. The confirmation process serves several purposes: examining qualifications and conflicts of interest through committee investigations and hearings, influencing policy by rejecting nominees or extracting promises, and sometimes delaying the process to gain leverage on unrelated matters.\n\nThe report then breaks down the types of nominations. Military appointments and promotions make up the majority, around 65,000 per two-year Congress, with most confirmed routinely. Civilian nominations include about 2,000, such as Foreign Service appointments, and many are routine. Other civilian nominations are for federal judges, executive department officers, independent agencies, and regulatory boards. Most nominations are confirmed, but the Senate can't review all due to the volume. The process allows for quick action on routine nominations, often through en bloc approvals. High-level positions receive more scrutiny, with some disputes and media attention. Judicial nominations, especially Supreme Court, are scrutinized more due to life tenure. Executive positions with policy roles are more likely to be examined and less likely to be confirmed than non-policy positions.\n\nThe report also mentions reasons for high confirmation rates. Most nominations are not to policymaking positions and are of less interest to the Senate. There's a sentiment that selecting people for executive positions is a presidential prerogative. Historically, the President has had wide latitude in selecting Cabinet and other high-ranking executive branch officials. Another reason is that Senators are often involved in the nomination stage. The President may prefer a smooth and fast confirmation process, so he might consult with Senators before choosing a nominee. Senators from the nominee's home state, leaders of the committee of jurisdiction, and leaders of the President's party in the Senate are most likely to be consulted. This leads to the \"senatorial courtesy\" where the Senate might decline to proceed on a nomination if a home-state Senator expresses opposition. Positions subject to this include U.S. attorneys, U.S. marshals, and U.S. district judges.\n\nThe report then discusses the process steps. The President sends nomination messages to the Senate, which are numbered and read on the floor. Nominations are referred to committees unless otherwise ordered. Some are listed in a special section of the Executive Calendar called", "answers": ["Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution provides that the President shall appoint officers of the United States \"by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate.\" This report describes the process by which the Senate provides advice and consent on presidential nominations, including receipt and referral of nominations, committee practices, and floor procedure. Committees play the central role in the process through investigations and hearings. Senate Rule XXXI provides that nominations shall be referred to appropriate committees \"unless otherwise ordered.\" Most nominations are referred, although a Senate standing order provides that some \"privileged\" nominations to specified positions will not be referred unless requested by a Senator. The Senate rule concerning committee jurisdictions (Rule XXV) broadly defines issue areas for committees, and the same jurisdictional statements generally apply to nominations as well as legislation. A committee often gathers information about a nominee either before or instead of a formal hearing. A committee considering a nomination has four options. It can report the nomination to the Senate favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation, or it can choose to take no action. It is more common for a committee to take no action on a nomination than to reject a nominee outright. The Senate handles executive business, which includes both nominations and treaties, separately from its legislative business. All nominations reported from committee are listed on the Executive Calendar, a separate document from the Calendar of Business, which lists pending bills and resolutions. Generally speaking, the majority leader schedules floor consideration of nominations on the Calendar. Nominations are considered in \"executive session,\" a parliamentary form of the Senate in session that has its own journal and, to some extent, its own rules of procedure. The Senate can call up a nomination expeditiously, because a motion to enter executive session to consider a specific nomination on the Calendar is not debatable. This motion requires a majority of Senators present and voting, a quorum being present, for approval. After a nomination has been called up, the question before the Senate is \"will the Senate advise and consent to this nomination?\" A majority of Senators voting is required to approve a nomination. However, Senate rules place no limit on how long a nomination may be debated, and ending consideration could require invoking cloture. On April 6, 2017, the Senate reinterpreted Rule XXII in order to allow cloture to be invoked on nominations to the Supreme Court by a majority of Senators voting. This expanded the results of similar actions taken by the Senate in November 2013, which changed the cloture vote requirement to a majority for nominations other than to the Supreme Court. After the 2013 decision, the number of nominations subjected to a cloture process increased. On April 3, 2019, the Senate reinterpreted Rule XXII again. The Senate reduced, from 30 hours to 2 hours, the maximum time nominations can be considered after cloture has been invoked. This change applied to all executive branch nominations except to high-level positions such as heads of departments, and it applied to all judicial nominations except to the Supreme Court and the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The full impact of this change is difficult to assess at this time, but it is likely to shorten the time between a cloture vote and a vote on the nomination. If Senators respond as they did to the last reinterpretation of the cloture rule, it might also increase the number of nominations subjected to a cloture process. Nominations that are pending when the Senate adjourns sine die at the end of a session or recesses for more than 30 days are returned to the President unless the Senate, by unanimous consent, waives the rule requiring their return (Senate Rule XXXI, clause 6). If a nomination is returned, and the President still desires Senate consideration, he must submit a new nomination."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5595}

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report explains that the LHWCA is a federal workers' compensation program that covers employees in maritime occupations on or adjacent to navigable waters of the US. It's administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), but benefits are paid by private insurers or self-insured companies. The LHWCA is a no-fault system, meaning workers can't sue employers for injuries or illnesses, but they get medical and disability benefits. The report mentions that in 2016, the LHWCA paid about $1.41 billion in benefits. It also talks about how most workers are covered by state laws, except for Texas where employers can opt out. The LHWCA was created in 1927 to cover workers who were previously not covered by any compensation system. The report also discusses the amendments to the LHWCA, such as the extension of coverage to areas adjacent to navigable waters in 1972, and the exclusion of certain workers, like those working on recreational vessels over 65 feet in length. There's a part about the 2011 DOL regulations defining recreational vessels for LHWCA coverage, which are based on the US Coast Guard's classifications. The report also mentions that there are bills to change these definitions, which could affect the types of vessels considered recreational and thus the workers covered. The LHWCA has been amended four times to expand coverage. The report also covers the benefits provided by the LHWCA, including medical benefits, disability benefits, and survivors benefits. It explains the process for handling claims, including the steps for resolving disputes and appealing decisions. The report also mentions the administrative costs and how they are funded, with a significant portion coming from general revenue and the rest from the Special Fund. The LHWCA provides medical benefits without deductibles or copays, disability benefits based on pre-injury wages, and survivors benefits to families of deceased workers. The report also discusses the administrative process for claims, including the role of the DOL in determining benefit eligibility and the steps for appealing decisions.

The LHWCA is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), and all benefit costs are paid by employers and their insurance carriers. In 2016, more than $1.4 billion in LHWCA benefits were paid to beneficiaries. Congress has extended the LHWCA provisions to cover workers outside of the maritime industry, such as overseas government contractors and civilian employees of military post exchanges. As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), persons who repair recreational vessels of any size were added to the LHWCA exemption list. In 2011, the DOL implemented this provision; since then, those regulations have proven controversial and numerous bills have been introduced to modify the regulatory definition to increase the number of workers exempted from the LHWCA.

It also directs the reader to other reports providing context for specific component appropriations. As part of an overall DHS budget that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimated to be $74.88 billion, the Trump Administration requested $47.43 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority through the appropriations process for DHS for FY2018. The request amounted to a $0.29 billion (0.6%) decrease from the $47.72 billion in annual appropriations enacted for FY2018 through the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141, Division F). The Administration also requested discretionary funding for DHS components that does not count against discretionary spending limits and is not reflected in the adjusted net discretionary budget authority total. The Administration requested an additional $6.65 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in disaster relief funding, as defined by the Budget Control Act (P.L. 112-25; BCA), and in the budget request for the Department of Defense (DOD), $165 million in Overseas Contingency Operations designated funding (OCO) from the Operations and Maintenance budget of the U.S. Navy. On June 21, 2018, the Senate Committee on Appropriations reported out S. 3109, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019, accompanied by S.Rept. 115-283. Committee-reported S. 3109 included $48.33 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for FY2019. This was $901 million (1.9%) above the level requested by the Administration, and $611 million (1.3%) above the enacted level for FY2018. The Senate committee-reported bill included the Administration-requested levels for disaster relief funding, and included the OCO funding in an appropriation to the Coast Guard, rather than as a transfer from the U.S. Navy. On July 26, 2018, the House Appropriations Committee marked up H.R. 6776, its version of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019. H.Rept. 115-948 was filed September 12, 2018.

The House committee-reported bill included the Administration-requested levels for disaster relief funding, but unlike S. 3109, did not include the OCO funding for the Coast Guard.

{"pred": " The report examines the legal and constitutional aspects of \"affirmative action\" in higher education, focusing on two distinct interpretations of the term. The first interpretation, rooted in the original sense of \"affirmative action,\" refers to the mandatory use of race-conscious measures by public higher education systems to eliminate the remnants of state-imposed racial segregation. This obligation stems from the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause, which mandates that states must eliminate all vestiges of their de jure segregated systems. In its 1992 decision United States v. Fordice, the Court outlined a three-step analysis to determine whether a state has fulfilled its constitutional obligation, examining whether a current policy is traceable to the de jure segregated system, has continued discriminatory effect, and can be modified or practicably eliminated consistent with sound educational policy. The report then discusses the other, more familiar sense of \"affirmative action\" in higher education: the voluntary consideration of student applicants' race as a way of increasing the participation of racial minorities in higher education. The federal courts have come to subject these voluntary \"affirmative action\" policies to a particularly searching form of review, known today as strict scrutiny. And they have so far upheld those policies under a single theory: that the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body uniquely justify some consideration of race when deciding how to assemble an incoming class. To rely on that diversity rationale, however, the Court now requires universities to articulate in concrete and precise terms what their diversity-related educational goals are, and why they have chosen those goals in particular. And even once those goals are established, a university must still show that its admissions policy achieves its diversity-related goals as precisely as possible, while ultimately \"treat[ing] each applicant as an individual.\" Both lines of cases discussed here have their roots in the Equal Protection Clause, and this report focuses primarily on public universities, all of which are directly subject to constitutional requirements. But those same requirements apply equally to private colleges and universities that receive federal funds pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI or the Act), which similarly prohibits recipients of federal dollars from discriminating on the basis of race. The report concludes by discussing the role that Title VI plays in ensuring equal protection in higher education, both public and private, including several avenues for congressional action under the Act. Though government-sanctioned racial segregation in public education is commonly associated with primary and secondary schools, numerous states had also mandated or permitted racial segregation in", "answers": ["When federal courts have analyzed and addressed \"affirmative action\" in higher education, they have done so in two distinct but related senses, both under the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of \"equal protection.\" The first has its roots in the original sense of \"affirmative action:\" the mandatory use of race by public education systems to eliminate the remnants of state-imposed racial segregation. Because state-sanctioned race segregation in public education violates the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, in certain cases involving a state's formerly de jure segregated public university system, a state's consideration of race in its higher education policies and practices may be an affirmative obligation. As the U.S. Supreme Court explained in its consequential 1992 decision United States v. Fordice, equal protection may require states that formerly maintained de jure segregated university systems to consider race for the purpose of eliminating all vestiges of their prior \"dual\" systems. Drawing upon its precedent addressing racially segregated public schools in the K-12 context, the Court established a three-part legal standard in Fordice for evaluating the sufficiency and effectiveness of a state's efforts in \"dismantl[ing]\" its formerly de jure segregated public university system. To that remedial end, mandatory race-conscious measures—in this de jure context—are not limited to admissions. Instead, remedies may also address policies and practices relating to academic programs, institutional missions, funding, and other aspects of public university operations. Outside this de jure context, \"affirmative action\" has come to refer to a different category of race-conscious policies. These involve what the Court at one time called the \"benign\" use of racial classifications—voluntary measures designed not to remedy past de jure discrimination, but to help racial minorities overcome the effects of their earlier exclusion. And for institutions of higher education, the Court has addressed one type of affirmative action policy in particular: the use of race as a factor in admissions decisions, a practice now widely observed by both public and private colleges and universities. The federal courts have come to subject these voluntary race-conscious policies—\"affirmative action\" in its perhaps more familiar sense—to a particularly searching form of review known as strict scrutiny. And even though this heightened judicial scrutiny has long been regarded as strict in theory but fatal in fact, the Court's review of race-conscious admissions policies in higher education has proved a notable exception, with the Court having twice upheld universities' use of race as one of many factors considered when assembling their incoming classes. The Court has long grappled with this seeming tension—between the strictness of its scrutiny and its approval of race-conscious admissions policies—beginning with its landmark 1978 decision in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke through its 2016 decision in Fisher v. University of Texas. Though the Equal Protection Clause generally concerns public universities and their constitutional obligations under the Fourteenth Amendment, federal statutory law also plays a role in ensuring equal protection in higher education. To that end, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits recipients of federal funding—including private colleges and universities—from, at a minimum, discriminating against students and applicants in a manner that would violate the Equal Protection Clause. Federal agencies, including the Departments of Justice and Education, investigate and administratively enforce institutions' compliance with Title VI."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12474}

The State Vocational Rehabilitation Services program is the primary federal effort to help individuals with disabilities prepare for and obtain employment. This program involves state VR agency staff working with individuals to create an individualized plan for employment, which outlines the employment goal and the specific services needed to achieve that goal. The Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) awards funds to state VR agencies through the program to help individuals with disabilities engage in gainful employment. States must provide a 21.3 percent nonfederal match of these funds. In fiscal year 2016, total program funds for VR—including state match funds—were $3.81 billion. States, territories, and the District of Columbia generally designate a single agency to administer the program, although, depending on state law, states may designate more than one agency. Twenty-three states have two separate agencies, one that exclusively serves blind and visually impaired individuals (known as agencies for the blind) and another that serves individuals who are not blind or visually impaired (known as general agencies). Twenty-seven states, the District of Columbia, and the five territories have a single combined agency that serves both blind and visually impaired individuals and individuals with other types of impairments (known as combined agencies). In total, there are 79 state VR agencies. In 2014, WIOA amended the Rehabilitation Act to require state VR agencies to provide students with disabilities with pre-employment transition services. According to information provided with its regulations, WIOA emphasized the provision of services to students with disabilities to ensure they have meaningful opportunities to receive training and other supports needed to achieve employment outcomes. WIOA requires states to make pre-employment transition services available statewide to all students with disabilities in need of such services, who are eligible or potentially eligible, regardless of whether a student has submitted an application for services from a state VR agency. In this context, students with disabilities include those with an individualized education program (IEP) for special education services through the school system, those receiving an accommodation for their disability, and others.

GAO reviewed documents and funding data from Education, and federal laws and regulations; surveyed all 79 state VR agencies (74 responded); held discussion groups with representatives of 29 state VR agencies; and interviewed officials from Education and three states (Idaho, Illinois, and Maryland) GAO selected for variety in size and type of agencies, among other factors. Of the 74 state vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies that responded to GAO's survey, most reported expanding services to help students with disabilities transition from school to work as required under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), enacted in July 2014. Most state agencies reported serving more students and providing work-based learning experiences and other activities, referred to as pre-employment transition services (see figure). State VR agencies reported two key challenges with implementing pre-employment transition services for students as required by WIOA. Spending reserved funds : States reported spending about $357 million out of the $465 million reserved for these services in fiscal year 2016. Education officials said that states had difficulty determining what expenditures were allowable, and some state officials said they would like more detailed information from Education. Education officials said they plan to clarify guidance but have no timeframe for providing further information, which would help states to better plan their use of reserved funds. Finalizing interagency agreements : Fewer than half the state VR agencies that responded to GAO's survey (34 of 74) reported updating their interagency agreement with their state's educational agency. Interagency agreements can help promote collaboration by, for example, establishing roles and responsibilities of each agency. Although Education offers technical assistance on interagency agreements, without increased efforts to raise awareness about the importance of these agreements and provide assistance to states where needed, Education may miss opportunities to help state VR and educational agencies efficiently and effectively coordinate services. In addition, WIOA requires Education to highlight best state practices, and most VR agencies responding to GAO's survey (63 of 74) reported this would be useful. Education does not have a written plan or timeframe for identifying and disseminating best practices. As a result, Education may miss opportunities to help more students with disabilities successfully transition from school to work. GAO is recommending that Education (1) establish timeframes for providing additional information on allowable expenditures, (2) take additional steps to assist states that have not updated and finalized their interagency agreements, and (3) develop a written plan with specific timeframes and activities for identifying and disseminating best practices.

The program is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Medicare consists of four parts: Part A (Hospital Insurance) covers inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing care, hospice care, and some home health services; Part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) covers physician services, outpatient services, and some preventive care; Part C (Medicare Advantage) is a private plan offering all Parts A and B services, except hospice; and Part D covers outpatient prescription drugs. The program is funded through a combination of payroll taxes, general revenues, and beneficiary premiums. Medicare serves approximately one in six Americans, with virtually all of the population aged 65 and older. In 2019, the program will cover an estimated 61 million persons (52 million aged and 9 million disabled). The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that total Medicare spending in 2019 will be about $772 billion; of this amount, approximately $749 billion will be spent on benefits. About 28% of Medicare benefit spending is for hospital inpatient and hospital outpatient services. CBO also estimates that federal Medicare spending (after deduction of beneficiary premiums and other offsetting receipts) will be about $637 billion in 2019, accounting for about 14% of total federal spending and 3% of GDP. Medicare is required to pay for all covered services provided to eligible persons, so long as specific criteria are met.

It was established in 1965 under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide health insurance to individuals 65 and older, and has been expanded over the years to include permanently disabled individuals under the age of 65. Medicare, which consists of four parts (A-D), covers hospitalizations, physician services, prescription drugs, skilled nursing facility care, home health visits, and hospice care, among other services. Generally, individuals are eligible for Medicare if they or their spouse worked for at least 40 quarters in Medicare-covered employment, are 65 years old, and are a citizen or permanent resident of the United States. Individuals may also qualify for coverage if they are a younger person who cannot work because they have a medical condition that is expected to last at least one year or result in death, or have end-stage renal disease (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplant). The program is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and by private entities that contract with CMS to provide claims processing, auditing, and quality oversight services. In FY2019, the program is expected to cover approximately 61 million persons (52 million aged and 9 million disabled) at a total cost of about $772 billion. Spending under the program (except for a portion of administrative costs) is considered mandatory spending and is not subject to the annual appropriations process. Services provided under Parts A and B (also referred to as \"original\" or \"traditional\" Medicare) are generally paid directly by the government on a \"fee-for-service\" basis, using different prospective payment systems or fee schedules. Under Parts C and D, private insurers are paid a monthly \"capitated\" amount to provide enrollees with required benefits. Medicare is required to pay for all covered services provided to eligible persons, so long as specific criteria are met. Since 1965, the Medicare program has undergone considerable change. For example, during the 111th Congress, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148 and P.L. 111-152) made numerous changes to the Medicare program that modified provider reimbursements, provided incentives to increase the quality and efficiency of care, and enhanced certain Medicare benefits. In the 114th Congress, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA; P.L. 114-10) changed the method for calculating updates to Medicare payment rates to physicians and altered how physicians and other practitioners will be paid in the future. Projections of future Medicare expenditures and funding indicate that the program will place increasing financial demands on the federal budget and on beneficiaries. For example, the Hospital Insurance (Part A) trust fund is projected to become insolvent in 2026. Additionally, although the Supplementary Medical Insurance (Parts B and D) trust fund is financed in large part through federal general revenues and cannot become insolvent, associated spending growth is expected to put increasing strains on the country's competing spending priorities.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report on U.S. foreign aid. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points. The report is quite detailed, so I need to identify the main objectives, the evolution of foreign aid, the role of Congress, and how it compares to other aid donors.\n\nFirst, the report mentions that U.S. foreign aid is the largest component of the international affairs budget. It has been viewed as an essential instrument of U.S. foreign policy for decades. The report discusses how the focus of U.S. foreign aid policy has transformed since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Global development is cited as a third pillar of U.S. national security, along with defense and diplomacy, in the national security strategies of the George W. Bush and Barack Obama Administrations. The Trump Administration's National Security Strategy does not explicitly address the status of development vis-à-vis diplomacy and defense, but it does note the historic importance of aid in achieving foreign policy goals and supporting U.S. national interests.\n\nThe report addresses frequently asked questions about the U.S. foreign aid program, including its objectives, costs, and organization, the role of Congress, and how it compares to those of other aid donors. It attempts to present a current snapshot of American foreign assistance and illustrate the extent to which this instrument of U.S. foreign policy has evolved over time. The data presented are the most current, consistent, and reliable figures available, generally updated through FY2017.\n\nThe report outlines the different types of foreign aid, their purposes, and the rationale behind them. It discusses the three key rationales for foreign assistance: National Security, Commercial Interests, and Humanitarian Concerns. These rationales have changed over time, with the focus shifting from global anti-communism to regional issues, such as Middle East peace initiatives, the transition to democracy of eastern Europe and republics of the former Soviet Union, and international illicit drug production and trafficking in the Andes. Without an overarching security rationale, foreign aid budgets decreased in the 1990s. However, since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, policymakers frequently have cast foreign assistance as a tool in U.S. counterterrorism strategy, increasing aid to partner states in counterterrorism efforts and funding the substantial reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nThe report also discusses the different types of foreign aid, such as military, bilateral development,", "answers": ["Foreign assistance is the largest component of the international affairs budget and is viewed by many as an essential instrument of U.S. foreign policy. On the basis of national security, commercial, and humanitarian rationales, U.S. assistance flows through many federal agencies and supports myriad objectives. These include promoting economic growth, reducing poverty, improving governance, expanding access to health care and education, promoting stability in conflict regions, countering terrorism, promoting human rights, strengthening allies, and curbing illicit drug production and trafficking. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, foreign aid has increasingly been associated with national security policy. At the same time, many Americans and some Members of Congress view foreign aid as an expense that the United States cannot afford given current budget deficits. In FY2017, U.S. foreign assistance, defined broadly, totaled an estimated $49.87 billion, or 1.2% of total federal budget authority. About 44% of this assistance was for bilateral economic development programs, including political/strategic economic assistance; 35% for military aid and nonmilitary security assistance; 18% for humanitarian activities; and 4% to support the work of multilateral institutions. Assistance can take the form of cash transfers, equipment and commodities, infrastructure, or technical assistance, and, in recent decades, is provided almost exclusively on a grant rather than loan basis. Most U.S. aid is implemented by nongovernmental organizations rather than foreign governments. The United States is the largest foreign aid donor in the world, accounting for about 24% of total official development assistance from major donor governments in 2017 (the latest year for which these data are available). Key foreign assistance trends in the past decade include growth in development aid, particularly global health programs; increased security assistance directed toward U.S. allies in the anti-terrorism effort; and high levels of humanitarian assistance to address a range of crises. Adjusted for inflation, annual foreign assistance funding over the past decade was the highest it has been since the Marshall Plan in the years immediately following World War II. In FY2017, Afghanistan, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, and Egypt received the largest amounts of U.S. aid, reflecting long-standing aid commitments to Israel and Egypt, the strategic significance of Afghanistan and Iraq, and the strategic and humanitarian importance of Jordan as the crisis in neighboring Syria continues. The Near East region received 27% of aid allocated by country or region in FY2017, followed by Africa, at 25%, and South and Central Asia, at 15%. This was a significant shift from a decade prior, when Africa received 19% of aid and the Near East 34%, reflecting significant increases in HIV/AIDS-related programs concentrated in Africa between FY2007 and FY2017 and the drawdown of U.S. military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Military assistance to Iraq began to decline starting in FY2011, but growing concern about the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has reversed this trend. This report provides an overview of the U.S. foreign assistance program by answering frequently asked questions on the subject. It is intended to provide a broad view of foreign assistance over time, and will be updated periodically.

{"pred": " The National Popular Vote (NPV) initiative, launched in 2006, aims to achieve direct popular election of the President and Vice President through an interstate compact, bypassing the need for a constitutional amendment. The current system, established by Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution, and later revised by the Twelfth Amendment, involves the electoral college, a body of electors appointed by the states to elect the President and Vice President. The electoral college, while not directly elected by the people, is designed to represent the interests of each state, with the number of electors equal to the combined total of the state's Senate and House of Representatives delegations. The District of Columbia is also allocated three electors, making the total 538. The goal of the NPV initiative is to achieve a situation where the President and Vice President are elected based on the national popular vote, with all states' votes counted, and the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide is elected. The initiative is based on the constitutional provision that states may appoint electors in any manner they choose, as long as the number of electors is equal to the combined total of the state's Senate and House of Representatives delegations. The initiative is supported by a bipartisan group of state legislators, including those from both major political parties. The initiative has been introduced in the legislatures of all 50 states and the District of Columbia, and has received some form of active consideration in 38 states and the D.C. Council. As of May 2019, 14 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the NPV compact, collectively holding 189 electoral votes. This represents 70% of the 270 votes needed for the compact to go into effect. The initiative has faced criticism for being an \"end run\" around the Constitution, as it does not follow the procedures set out in Article V for constitutional amendments. Critics argue that the initiative would create more problems than the current system, and that it would not be a legitimate innovation. The initiative has also been criticized for potentially violating the Voting Rights Act, as it could dilute the voting power of a given state's minority population by reducing its ability to influence the outcome of presidential elections. The initiative has been supported by various state legislatures, including those in Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Washington, Massachusetts, the District of Columbia, Vermont, California, Rhode Island, New York, Connecticut, Colorado, Delaware, and New Mexico", "answers": ["The National Popular Vote (NPV) initiative proposes an agreement among the states, an interstate compact that would effectively achieve direct popular election of the President and Vice President without a constitutional amendment. It relies on the Constitution's grant of authority to the states in Article II, Section 1 to appoint presidential electors \"in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct.... \" Any state that joins the NPV compact pledges that if the compact comes into effect, its legislature will award all the state's electoral votes to the presidential ticket that wins the most popular votes nationwide, regardless of who wins in that particular state. The compact would, however, come into effect only if its success has been assured; that is, only if states controlling a majority of electoral votes (270 or more) join the compact. By early May 2019, 14 states and the District of Columbia had joined the compact. After early momentum—eight states and the District of Columbia joined the NPV Compact between 2007 and 2011—the pace of state accessions slowed through 2018. Since then, four additional states joined, bringing the total number of electoral votes controlled by NPV member states to 189. During the same period, legislation to join the compact had been introduced during the current session in at least one chamber of the legislature in 14 additional states that control an additional 150 electors. The NPV initiative emerged following the presidential election of 2000, in which one ticket gained an electoral vote majority, winning the presidency, but received fewer popular votes than its opponents. NPV grew out of subsequent discussions among scholars and activists about how to avoid similar outcomes in the future and to achieve direct popular election. Proponents of NPV assert that it would guarantee the presidential candidates who win the most popular votes nationwide will always win the presidency; that it would end the inequities of the general ticket/winner-take-all system of awarding electoral votes; and that candidates would extend their focus beyond winning the \"battleground states,\" campaigning more widely and devoting greater attention to issues of concern to other parts of the country. They further assert that NPV would accomplish this while avoiding the exacting standards set for the proposal and ratification of constitutional amendments. Opponents argue that NPV would undermine the authority of states under the Constitution and the Founders' intention that presidential elections should be both national and federal contests; that it is an admitted \"end run\" around the Constitution that would circumvent the amendment process; and that it might actually lead to more disputed presidential elections characterized by politically contentious state recounts. The NPV has also been debated on legal grounds. Some observers maintain that it must be approved by Congress, because it is an interstate compact that would affect key provisions of constitutional presidential election procedures. NPV Inc., the organization managing the initiative's advocacy campaign, responds that congressional approval is not necessary because NPV concerns the appointment of electors, a subject that falls within state constitutional authority, and that the Supreme Court has previously rejected arguments that similar compacts would impair the rights of nonmember states. Other critics claim that NPV might violate the Voting Rights Act by diluting minority voter influence and avoiding the recently invalidated preclearance requirement for election procedure changes in covered jurisdictions. In response, NPV Inc. has asserted that the compact is \"entirely consistent with the goal of the Voting Rights Act.\" This report monitors the NPV's progress in the states and will identify and analyze further developments as warranted."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10755}
{"pred": " \n\nThe report discusses the federal government's plan to invest over $96 billion in IT for fiscal year 2018, the largest budget ever. However, it highlights that many IT projects have failed, resulting in cost overruns, schedule slippages, and minimal mission-related outcomes. Examples include the tri-agency National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, which was disbanded after spending 16 years and almost $5 billion. Other notable failures include the DHS Secure Border Initiative Network, the VA Financial and Logistics Integrated Technology Enterprise, and the DoD Expeditionary Combat Support System. These projects often suffered from a lack of disciplined and effective management, such as project planning, requirements definition, and program oversight and governance. In many instances, agencies had not consistently applied best practices that are critical to successfully acquiring IT. Such projects have also failed due to a lack of oversight and governance. Executive-level governance and oversight across the government has often been ineffective, specifically from CIOs. For example, some CIOs’ roles were limited because they did not have the authority to review and approve the entire agency IT portfolio. In addition to failures when acquiring IT, security deficiencies can threaten systems once they become operational. The report highlights that, despite various efforts to improve cybersecurity, many federal agencies still face significant information security deficiencies. FITARA and related legislation, such as the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA), aim to improve federal cybersecurity and address IT management issues. The report also outlines the current state of federal IT, including the challenges in modernizing systems and the need for continued efforts to improve cybersecurity. Overall, the report emphasizes the importance of implementing the recommendations made by the GAO to improve the management and security of federal IT, which can lead to significant cost savings and improved mission outcomes.\n\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points. The report is about federal IT investments and the issues that arise with those investments. \n\nFirst, the President's budget for fiscal year 2018 includes over $96 billion for IT, which is the largest amount ever budgeted. However, the report points out that many IT projects have failed, leading to cost overruns, schedule delays, and little to no mission-related outcomes. There are several examples given, like the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, which was disbanded after spending 16 years and almost $", "answers": ["The federal government plans to invest almost $96 billion in IT in fiscal year 2018. Historically, IT investments have too often failed or contributed little to mission-related outcomes. Further, increasingly sophisticated threats and frequent cyber incidents underscore the need for effective information security. As a result, GAO added two areas to its high-risk list: IT security in 1997 and the management of IT acquisitions and operations in 2015. This statement summarizes agencies' progress in improving IT management and ensuring the security of federal IT. It is primarily based on GAO's prior reports issued between February 1997 and May 2018 (and an ongoing review) on (1) CIO responsibilities, (2) agency CIOs' involvement in approving IT contracts, (3) data center consolidation efforts, (4) the management of software licenses, and (5) compliance with cybersecurity requirements. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and federal agencies have taken steps to improve the management of information technology (IT) acquisitions and operations and ensure the security of federal IT through a series of initiatives. As of May 2018, agencies had fully implemented about 61 percent of the approximately 800 IT management-related recommendations that GAO made from fiscal years 2010 through 2015. Likewise, since 2010, agencies had implemented about 66 percent of the approximately 2,700 security-related recommendations as of May 2018. Even with this progress, significant actions remain to be completed. Chief Information Officer (CIO) responsibilities . Laws such as the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) and related guidance assigned 35 key IT management responsibilities to CIOs to help address longstanding challenges. However, in a draft report on CIO responsibilities, GAO's preliminary results suggest that none of the 24 selected agencies have policies that fully address the role of their CIO, as called for by federal laws and guidance. GAO intends to recommend that OMB and each of the selected 24 agencies take actions to improve the effectiveness of CIO's implementation of their responsibilities. IT contract approval . According to FITARA, covered agencies' CIOs are required to review and approve IT contracts. Nevertheless, in January 2018, GAO reported that most of the CIOs at 22 selected agencies were not adequately involved in reviewing billions of dollars of IT acquisitions. Consequently, GAO made 39 recommendations to improve CIO oversight over IT acquisitions. Consolidating data centers . OMB launched an initiative in 2010 to reduce data centers, which was codified and expanded in FITARA. According to agencies, data center consolidation and optimization efforts have resulted in approximately $3.9 billion of cost savings through 2018. Even so, additional work remains. GAO has made 160 recommendations to OMB and agencies to improve the reporting of related cost savings and to achieve optimization targets; however, as of May 2018, 80 of the recommendations have not been fully addressed. Managing software licenses . Effective management of software licenses can help avoid purchasing too many licenses that result in unused software. In May 2014, GAO reported that better management of licenses was needed to achieve savings, and made 135 recommendations to improve such management. Four years later, 78 of the recommendations remained open. Improving the security of federal IT systems . While the government has acted to protect federal information systems, agencies need to improve security programs, cyber capabilities, and the protection of personally identifiable information. Over the last several years, GAO has made about 2,700 recommendations to agencies aimed at improving the security of federal systems and information. These recommendations identified actions for agencies to take to strengthen their information security programs and technical controls over their computer networks and systems. As of May 2018, about 800 of the information security-related recommendations had not been implemented. From fiscal years 2010 through 2015, GAO made about 800 recommendations to OMB and federal agencies to address shortcomings in IT acquisitions and operations. Since 2010, GAO also made about 2,700 recommendations to federal agencies to improve the security of federal systems. These recommendations include those to improve the implementation of CIO responsibilities, the oversight of the data center consolidation initiative, software license management efforts, and the strength of security programs and technical controls. Most agencies agreed with these recommendations, and GAO will continue to monitor their implementation."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6259}

The United States helped end the Bosnian war (1992-1995), one of the most lethal conflicts in Europe since the Second World War, by leading NATO airstrikes against Bosnian Serb forces, brokering the Dayton Peace Agreement in 1995, and deploying 20,000 U.S. troops. Some Members of Congress became involved in policy debates over these measures, and Congress monitored and at times challenged the Bush and Clinton Administrations' response through numerous hearings, resolutions, and legislative proposals. Since 1995, the United States has been a major source of aid to Bosnia and firmly supports its territorial integrity. The United States also supports Bosnia's aspirations for NATO and European Union (EU) membership. Today, Bosnia faces serious challenges. Nearly 25 years after the Dayton Agreement, Bosnia continues to use part of the Agreement as its constitution, which divides the country into two ethnoterritorial entities. Critics charge that Bosnia's political system is too decentralized to enact the reforms required for NATO and EU membership. They also contend that the ethnic power-sharing arrangements and veto points embedded in numerous government bodies are sources of gridlock. Domestic and international courts have ruled against several aspects of Bosnia's constitution, yet the Bosnian government thus far has failed to implement these rulings. Since Bosnia's independence, its politics has been dominated by ethnic parties representing the country's three main groups: Bosniaks (Slavic Muslims), Croats, and Serbs. These parties have prospered under a system that critics charge lacks transparency and accountability. Critics also maintain that ethnic party leaders use divisive nationalist rhetoric to distract from serious issues affecting the country as a whole, including poverty, unemployment, and stalled political reforms. The Bosnian population exhibits low trust in political parties and the government, and disaffection toward the country's elite. U.S. and EU officials brokered several ultimately unsuccessful rounds of constitutional reform negotiations, and continue to call on Bosnia's leaders to implement reforms to make governance more efficient and effective, dismantle patronage networks, and bring Bosnia closer to EU and NATO membership. However, there is little consensus among the country's leaders on how the country should be reformed. Bosnian Serb leaders from the Serb-majority entity (Republika Srpska) have called for greater autonomy and even secession from Bosnia. Some Bosnian Croat leaders have called for partitioning Bosnia's other entity, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to create a separate Croat-majority entity. Bosniak leaders, by contrast, generally prefer a more centralized state. Many analysts caution that any move to partition the country could lead to renewed violence, while greater decentralization could make Bosnia's government less functional. U.S. policy has long been oriented toward preserving Bosnia's statehood. Bosnia's 2018 general elections largely returned to power the same entrenched ethnic parties. Of particular concern is the election of Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik to Bosnia's collective presidency. Dodik, a sharp critic of the United States and NATO, has periodically called for a referendum on Republika Srpska's secession. He is under U.S. sanctions for obstructing the Dayton Agreement. In addition to these internal challenges, U.S. and EU officials have expressed concern over external influence in the region. Russia reportedly relies on soft power, energy leverage, and \"spoiler\" tactics to influence Bosnia, particularly in the Serb-majority entity. Turkish soft power draws on Bosnia's Ottoman-era heritage and Turkey's shared religious tradition with Bosniaks. China is a more recent presence in the region, but its heavy investments and lending have prompted concern on both sides of the Atlantic. Policymakers have also expressed concern at the challenges posed by the return of Bosnians who fought with the Islamic State and Nusra Front in Syria and Iraq. Many observers contend that the United States remains a stakeholder in Bosnia's future because of its central role in resolving the conflict and shaping the postwar Bosnian state. Given the history of U.S. involvement in Bosnia, Bosnia's importance to regional stability in the Balkans, and concerns over Russian and Chinese influence in Bosnia, Members of Congress may be interested in monitoring how the country navigates its internal and external challenges. Congress may also consider future U.S. aid levels to Bosnia and the degree to which such assistance supports the long-standing U.S. policy objectives for Bosnia of territorial integrity, NATO and EU integration, energy security, and resilience against malign influence."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8598}
{"pred": " The report outlines the roles of the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the federal judiciary in requesting and collecting restitution for victims of federal crimes. DOJ, through its Criminal Division and the 94 U.S. Attorneys' Offices (USAOs), oversees criminal matters, including identifying and notifying victims, determining their losses, prosecuting cases, and negotiating plea agreements that may include restitution. Within DOJ, the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section manages the Asset Forfeiture Program, which is used to collect restitution from offenders. The Federal Litigation Unit (FLU) within each USAO is responsible for collecting restitution from offenders in their district. Additionally, all USAOs have asset forfeiture staff responsible for forfeiting property seized by law enforcement agencies because the property was used in criminal activities or purchased with the proceeds of criminal activities. The report highlights the importance of coordination between FLU and Asset Forfeiture units to use forfeited assets as a means to collect on unpaid restitution debts. DOJ requires each USAO to have its own policies and procedures related to debt collection efforts but allows them discretion in developing these policies and procedures to ensure that they are appropriate for local conditions. The report also discusses the role of the federal judiciary in ordering restitution, receiving payments, and disbursing payments to victims.

Various entities within the federal government are involved in the process of requesting, ordering, and collecting restitution for crime victims, including DOJ and the judiciary. The Justice for All Reauthorization Act of 2016 includes a provision for GAO to review the federal criminal restitution process for fiscal years 2014 through 2016. This report addresses, among other things: (1) the extent to which information is available on restitution requested by DOJ and ordered by courts; (2) the amount of restitution debt DOJ collected and the amount that remains outstanding; and, (3) the extent to which DOJ has conducted oversight on the collection of restitution. GAO analyzed laws, policies and procedures as well as USSC data on restitution orders and DOJ data on restitution collected from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. GAO also selected a non-generalizable sample of six federal judicial districts based on restitution collections and spoke with USAO officials and federal probation officers. Officials from selected U.S. Attorney's Offices (USAO) stated that they document requests for restitution in case files and employ other internal controls, such as the use of templates and forms, throughout the prosecution process to ensure that prosecutors request restitution as appropriate. GAO's analysis of U.S. Sentencing Commission (USSC) data—an agency within the judiciary—showed that information on restitution orders was available for 95 percent of all offenders sentenced from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. Specifically, 214,578 federal offenders were sentenced during this time period and restitution was ordered for 33,158, or 15 percent, of those offenders. Collectively, courts ordered these offenders to pay $33.9 billion in restitution. Most federal offenders sentenced during these years were sentenced for immigration or drug-related offenses. In interviews, USAO officials stated that these offenses do not typically have victims requiring restitution. GAO found that data on reasons why restitution was not ordered were incomplete for 5 percent of all offenders sentenced from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. Determining why data on restitution orders are incomplete may inform the judiciary of the cause of the incomplete data and any efforts needed to improve USSC data. GAO's analysis of Department of Justice (DOJ) data showed that USAOs collected $2.95 billion in restitution debt in fiscal years 2014 through 2016, see figure below. However, at the end of fiscal year 2016, $110 billion in previously ordered restitution remained outstanding, and USAOs identified $100 billion of that outstanding debt as uncollectible due to offenders' inability to pay. DOJ identified improving debt collection—including restitution—as a major management initiative in its 2014-2018 Strategic Plan. While DOJ is developing analytical tools to monitor the collection of restitution, it has not established performance measures or goals. Performance measures and goals would allow DOJ to gauge USAOs' success in collecting restitution and, by extension, the department's success in achieving a major management initiative.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about Fire Management Assistance Grants (FMAGs) under the Stafford Act. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report explains that FMAGs are federal grants authorized by Section 420 of the Stafford Act. They were established by regulation in 2001. These grants help with fire suppression on public or private forest or grassland. The President can declare an FMAG, and this authority is delegated to FEMA's Regional Administrators. The FMAG declaration allows federal assistance like equipment, personnel, and grants to state, local, and tribal governments for controlling, managing, and mitigating fires. There's a cost-sharing component where the state pays 25% of the expenses. The report addresses frequently asked questions about FMAGs, including how they are requested, evaluated using thresholds, and the types of assistance provided. \n\nRequests can be made by a state when the governor determines a fire is out of control and threatens to become a major disaster. The request is submitted to FEMA, typically the Regional Administrator. Requests can be made anytime, even by phone, but must be followed by written confirmation within 14 days. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 allows tribes to request FMAGs similarly to states. However, some tribal lands are administered by the federal government and receive support through the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), which doesn't require reimbursement. \n\nThe report details the process for requesting FMAGs, including the necessary information such as fire size, population at risk, evacuations, weather conditions, and state/local resource commitment. There are two types of fire cost thresholds: individual for a single fire and cumulative for multiple fires. The thresholds vary by state, with some states using the sum of three individual thresholds, while others have a fixed amount. For example, Pennsylvania's individual threshold is $927,274, and the cumulative threshold is three times that, totaling $2,781,822. Alaska's individual threshold is $100,000, but the cumulative threshold is $500,000. \n\nIf FEMA denies the request, the state can appeal within 30 days, providing additional information. The appeal is reviewed by the Regional Administrator, then forwarded to FEMA Headquarters, with a decision within 90 days.

IHS operates a network of hospitals, clinics, and health stations, and also provides funds to tribally operated facilities. In fiscal year 2017, IHS allocated about $1.9 billion for health services provided by federally and tribally operated facilities. Federally operated IHS facilities, which received over 5.2 million outpatient visits and over 15,000 inpatient admissions in 2016, provide mostly primary and emergency care, as well as some ancillary and specialty services in 26 hospitals, 55 health centers, and 21 health stations. These facilities are located primarily in service areas that are rural, isolated, and underserved. The IHS data demonstrate large percentages of vacancies for providers in the 8 areas in which IHS has substantial direct care responsibilities. As of November 2017, the overall percentage of vacancies for physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, CRNAs, certified nurse midwives, physician assistants, dentists, and pharmacists in these areas was 25 percent, ranging from 13 to 31 percent across the areas. However, variation in vacancy rates existed among provider types across IHS areas. For example, while the overall percentage of vacancies for physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, dentists, and physician assistants each exceeded 25 percent, the vacancy rate for pharmacists was less than 25 percent. In addition, for certain provider types in some areas, more than one-third of the positions were vacant. For example, although 29 percent of the total positions for physicians across these 8 areas were vacant, the vacancy rate ranged from 21 percent in the Oklahoma City area to 46 percent in the Bemidji and Billings areas. Similarly, across these 8 areas 32 percent of the total positions for nurse practitioners were vacant, ranging from 12 percent in the Oklahoma City area to 47 percent in the Albuquerque area. The report also discusses the challenges of rural health care delivery, including more complex patient health status and poorer socioeconomic conditions, as well as physician workforce shortages. IHS has implemented various strategies to recruit and retain providers, including financial incentives, professional development opportunities, and subsidized housing. Despite these efforts,", "answers": ["IHS is charged with providing health care to AI/AN people who are members or descendants of 573 tribes. According to IHS, AI/AN people born today have a life expectancy that is 5.5 years less than all races in the United States, and they die at higher rates than other Americans from preventable causes. The ability to recruit and retain a stable clinical workforce capable of providing quality and timely care is critical for IHS. GAO was asked to review provider vacancies at IHS. This report examines (1) IHS provider vacancies and challenges filling them; (2) strategies IHS has used to recruit and retain providers; and (3) strategies IHS has used to mitigate the negative effects of provider vacancies. GAO reviewed IHS human resources data for the provider positions that the agency tracks. GAO also reviewed policies, federal internal control standards, and legal authorities related to providers in federally operated IHS facilities. GAO interviewed IHS officials at the headquarters and area level and at selected facilities. GAO selected facilities based on variation in their number of direct care outpatient visits and inpatient hospital beds in 2014. Indian Health Service (IHS) data show sizeable vacancy rates for clinical care providers in the eight IHS geographic areas where the agency provides substantial direct care to American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) people. The overall vacancy rate for providers—physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, certified registered nurse anesthetists, certified nurse midwives, physician assistants, dentists, and pharmacists—was 25 percent, ranging from 13 to 31 percent across the areas. IHS officials told GAO that challenges to filling these vacancies include the rural location of many IHS facilities and insufficient housing for providers. Officials said long-standing vacancies have a negative effect on patient access, quality of care, and employee morale. IHS uses multiple strategies to recruit and retain providers, including offering increased salaries for certain positions, but it still faces challenges matching local market salaries. IHS also offers other financial incentives, and has made some housing available when possible. In addition, IHS uses strategies, such as contracting with temporary providers, to maintain patient access to services and reduce provider burnout. Officials said these temporary providers are more costly than salaried employees and can interrupt patients' continuity of care. However, IHS lacks agency-wide information on the costs and number of temporary providers used at its facilities, which impedes IHS officials' ability to target its resources to address gaps in provider staffing and ensure access to health services across IHS facilities. GAO recommends that IHS obtain, on an agency-wide basis, information on temporary provider contractors, including their associated cost and number of full-time equivalents, and use this information to inform decisions about resource allocation and provider staffing.

{"pred": " The report discusses the current state of the U.S. Navy's attack submarine fleet, highlighting both the strengths and the persistent challenges faced by the Navy. The fleet consists of 51 submarines, including 33 Los Angeles class, 3 Seawolf class, and 15 Virginia class submarines. These submarines are homeported at various locations in the United States, with some overseas in the U.S. territory of Guam. The report emphasizes the strict safety culture that permeates the submarine community, which has been instrumental in preventing another loss at sea since the tragic sinking of the USS Thresher in 1963. The Navy has implemented the SUBSAFE program, which ensures that critical systems are properly maintained and documented, thereby providing maximum reasonable assurance that these systems will protect the crew from flooding and allow the submarine to conduct an emergency surfacing should flooding occur. The report also highlights the significant maintenance delays and idle time experienced by the Navy's attack submarine fleet, which has resulted in substantial operating and support costs. The primary driver of these delays is the inability to complete depot maintenance, which has led to a significant number of days of lost time and increased costs. The report estimates that since fiscal year 2008, the Navy has spent over $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2018 constant dollars on attack submarines that are delayed in getting into and out of maintenance. The report also notes that the Navy has not yet taken additional steps to maximize attack submarine readiness that fully address challenges such as the allocation of maintenance periods between public and private shipyards. The report concludes that the Navy needs to take more proactive steps to address these challenges, including conducting a comprehensive business case analysis to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards. This analysis should include an assessment of private shipyard capacity to perform attack submarine maintenance, and should incorporate a complete accounting of both (a) the costs and risks associated with attack submarines sitting idle, and (b) the qualitative benefits associated with having the potential to both mitigate risk in new submarine construction and provide additional availability to the combatant commanders. The report also recommends that the Navy develop a comprehensive plan for shipyard capital investment, which would help address the Navy’s maintenance challenges and improve the Navy’s readiness.

These capabilities make attack submarines some of the most–requested assets by the global combatant commanders. GAO was asked to review the readiness of the Navy's attack submarine force. This report discusses the extent to which the Navy (1) has experienced maintenance delays in its attack submarine fleet and costs associated with any delays; and (2) has addressed any challenges and developed mitigation plans for any maintenance delays. GAO analyzed readiness information from fiscal years 2008-2018, operating and support costs, maintenance performance, and other data; visited attack submarines and squadrons; and interviewed public and private shipyard and fleet officials. This is a public version of a classified report issued in October 2018. Information the Department of Defense deemed classified or sensitive, such as attack submarine force structure requirements and detailed data on attack submarine maintenance delays, has been omitted. The Navy has been unable to begin or complete the vast majority of its attack submarine maintenance periods on time resulting in significant maintenance delays and operating and support cost expenditures. GAO's analysis of Navy maintenance data shows that between fiscal year 2008 and 2018, attack submarines have incurred 10,363 days of idle time and maintenance delays as a result of delays in getting into and out of the shipyards. For example, the Navy originally scheduled the USS Boise to enter a shipyard for an extended maintenance period in 2013 but, due to heavy shipyard workload, the Navy delayed the start of the maintenance period. In June 2016, the USS Boise could no longer conduct normal operations and the boat has remained idle, pierside for over two years since then waiting to enter a shipyard (see figure). GAO estimated that since fiscal year 2008 the Navy has spent more than $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2018 constant dollars to support attack submarines that provide no operational capability—those sitting idle while waiting to enter the shipyards, and those delayed in completing their maintenance at the shipyards. The Navy has started to address challenges related to workforce shortages and facilities needs at the public shipyards. However, it has not effectively allocated maintenance periods among public shipyards and private shipyards that may also be available to help minimize attack submarine idle time. GAO's analysis found that while the public shipyards have operated above capacity for the past several years, attack submarine maintenance delays are getting longer and idle time is increasing. The Navy may have options to mitigate this idle time and maintenance delays by leveraging private shipyard capacity for repair work. But the Navy has not completed a comprehensive business case analysis as recommended by Department of Defense guidelines to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards. Navy leadership has acknowledged that they need to be more proactive in leveraging potential private shipyard repair capacity. Without addressing this challenge, the Navy risks continued expenditure of operating and support funding to crew, maintain, and support attack submarines that provide no operational capability because they are delayed in getting into and out of maintenance.

{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about the Aegis BMD program. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points.\n\nThe report is from a government agency, and it's providing background and issues for Congress regarding the Aegis BMD program. The main issue is whether to approve, reject, or modify the DOD's acquisition strategies and proposed funding levels for the program. Congress's decisions could significantly affect U.S. BMD capabilities, funding requirements, and the BMD-related industrial base.\n\nThe Aegis system was originally developed in the 1970s for defending ships against aircraft, anti-ship cruise missiles, surface threats, and subsurface threats. It was first deployed in 1983 and has been updated many times since. The system is now used on Aegis cruisers and destroyers, which are equipped with the Aegis ship combat system. The report mentions the different variants of the Aegis BMD system, such as 3.6.X, 4.0.3, 4.1, 5.0 CU, 5.1, and 6.X. Each variant has different capabilities, and the report correlates them with the phases of the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) for European BMD operations.\n\nThe Aegis BMD system was originally designed to intercept theater-range ballistic missiles, which are short-, medium-, and intermediate-range ballistic missiles. The system's radar can also provide data to other U.S. BMD systems that are designed to intercept intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). The report discusses the potential for the Aegis BMD system to intercept certain ICBMs, especially with the new SM-3 Block IIA interceptor. The DOD is evaluating this capability, and there are plans to test it in 2020.\n\nThe report also discusses the different BMD interceptors used by Aegis ships, including the SM-3, SM-2 Block IV, and SM-6. The SM-3 is designed for exo-atmospheric intercepts, while the SM-2 is for endo-atmospheric intercepts. The SM-6 is a dual-capability missile that can be used for both air defense and ballistic missile defense.\n\nThe report mentions the Navy's plans to increase the number of BMD-capable Aegis ships from 38 at the end of FY201", "answers": ["The Aegis ballistic missile defense (BMD) program, which is carried out by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and the Navy, gives Navy Aegis cruisers and destroyers a capability for conducting BMD operations. Under the FY2020 budget submission, the number of BMD-capable Navy Aegis ships is projected to increase from 38 at the end of FY2018 to 59 at the end of FY2024. BMD-capable Aegis ships operate in European waters to defend Europe from potential ballistic missile attacks from countries such as Iran, and in in the Western Pacific and the Persian Gulf to provide regional defense against potential ballistic missile attacks from countries such as North Korea and Iran. The Aegis BMD program is funded mostly through MDA's budget. The Navy's budget provides additional funding for BMD-related efforts. MDA's proposed FY2020 budget requests a total of $1,784.2 million (i.e., about $1.8 billion) in procurement and research and development funding for Aegis BMD efforts, including funding for two Aegis Ashore sites in Poland and Romania. MDA's budget also includes operations and maintenance (O&M) and military construction (MilCon) funding for the Aegis BMD program. Issues for Congress regarding the Aegis BMD program include the following: whether to approve, reject, or modify MDA's FY2020 funding procurement and research and development funding requests for the program; required numbers of BMD-capable Aegis ships versus available numbers of BMD-capable Aegis ships; the burden that BMD operations may be placing on the Navy's fleet of Aegis ships, and whether there are alternative ways to perform BMD missions now performed by U.S. Navy Aegis ships, such as establishing more Aegis Ashore sites; burden sharing—how allied contributions to regional BMD capabilities and operations compare to U.S. naval contributions to overseas regional BMD capabilities and operations; whether to convert the Aegis test facility in Hawaii into an operational land-based Aegis BMD site; the potential for ship-based lasers, electromagnetic railguns (EMRGs), and hypervelocity projectiles (HVPs) to contribute in coming years to Navy terminal-phase BMD operations and the impact this might eventually have on required numbers of ship-based BMD interceptor missiles; and technical risk and test and evaluation issues in the Aegis BMD program."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6599}

The report is about U.S. agencies and their activities related to promoting exports, with a focus on tobacco products. \n\nFirst, the report mentions that U.S. agencies perform various activities that contribute to export promotion, and the responsibility is dispersed. Some of these services are intended to help U.S. companies enter foreign markets or expand their presence abroad. Examples include distributing trade-related information, conducting market research, and providing counseling throughout the export process. Additionally, agencies may use diplomatic tools to advocate for U.S. companies to ensure they can compete on a level playing field in export markets.\n\nThen, the report talks about restrictions on using funds for promoting tobacco. Three agencies—State, Commerce, and USDA—have appropriations that are restricted from being used to promote the sale or export of U.S. tobacco or tobacco products. These restrictions were in place since the 1990s. The report also mentions that Congress has prohibited the use of funds for these agencies to promote tobacco products, and this has been done through annual appropriations acts. \n\nThe report discusses the development of guidance cables by the agencies to implement these restrictions. These cables are used as the primary source of guidance for officials overseas. The cables are updated periodically to address changes in tobacco technology and other emerging issues. However, the guidance is not always clear, and there are areas where additional clarification is needed. \n\nThe report also highlights that not all officials were aware of the restrictions and that more than half had not received training about the restrictions. Including information about the restrictions in training materials would help make officials aware of the restrictions early in their careers and prompt them to seek guidance if a tobacco-related issue arises. \n\nAdditionally, the report points out that some officials are unsure whether they can attend events where representatives from U.S. tobacco companies may be present. The guidance does not specifically address attendance at events also attended by tobacco company representatives. \n\nThe report also mentions that the agencies have implemented the funding restrictions on promoting tobacco exports as outlined in the interagency guidance cable. However, there are areas where the guidance could be improved. \n\nThe report concludes with three recommendations: including information about the restrictions in training materials, updating the guidance cable to address ambiguities, and ensuring consistent implementation of the restrictions. \n\nI need to condense all this into a one-page summary. Let me structure it with an introduction, key findings, and recommendations", "answers": ["The World Health Organization estimates that tobacco use kills over 7 million people each year, more than tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and malaria combined. Since the 1990s, Congress has enacted restrictions regarding the use of certain appropriated funds to promote U.S. tobacco exports. GAO was asked to review the implementation of these restrictions. This report examines (1) guidance select U.S. agencies have issued to implement these restrictions, (2) whether overseas officials from select U.S. agencies were aware of the restrictions and guidance, and (3) select U.S. agencies' implementation of the guidance overseas. GAO reviewed U.S. laws, agency guidance, and internal communications; analyzed Commerce data; and interviewed agency officials in Washington, D.C. and in 24 offices across 11 overseas posts in 9 countries. GAO selected these countries based on criteria that included U.S. tobacco export totals, smoking rates, and geographic dispersion. Congress has restricted the use of certain appropriated funding to promote tobacco exports and the Departments of State (State), Commerce (Commerce), and Agriculture (USDA) have issued interagency guidance through the cable system that they rely on to implement these restrictions. State collaborates with these and other agencies to periodically update this cable. The cable informs officials about the types of actions they should take—such as providing routine business facilitation services to all U.S. companies—and the types of actions they should not take—such as attending events sponsored by tobacco companies. Most, but not all, officials overseas that GAO interviewed were aware of the restrictions and received some guidance concerning the restrictions. However, GAO found that some officials did not recall receiving the interagency guidance cable. In addition, State and USDA's current training materials do not address the restrictions. Federal internal control standards state that appropriate training is essential to an organization's operational success. Thus, providing officials overseas with training about the funding restrictions and related guidance would help to ensure that officials are aware of the restrictions. U.S. officials overseas have implemented restrictions on promoting tobacco, but some officials said that the interagency guidance lacks clarity. Officials said that they have not promoted tobacco by, for example, attending events sponsored solely by tobacco companies. However, officials identified three areas of the guidance that are unclear: (1) attendance at events not sponsored by U.S. tobacco companies but attended by representatives of these companies; (2) the types of services officials can provide tobacco companies; and (3) the description of tobacco products, such as whether component parts for electronic cigarettes are included. Federal standards for internal control state that management should clearly document internal controls in policies and guidance to prevent officials from failing to achieve an objective or address a risk. By providing more specific guidance, the agencies would help ensure that officials consistently implement the funding restrictions on promoting tobacco. GAO recommends that (1) State and USDA include information about the funding restrictions and guidance in training materials for relevant employees and (2) State, in consultation with Commerce and USDA, assess and update the interagency guidance cable, as needed, on promoting tobacco in light of questions raised by officials at posts overseas.

The report is about the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and their medical centers. The key findings seem to be about the lack of documentation for provider reviews and the failure to report providers to the National Practitioner Data Base (NPDB) and state licensing boards.\n\nFirst, the report mentions that from October 2013 to March 2017, five VA medical centers had 148 providers reviewed after concerns were raised. However, officials couldn't provide documentation for almost half of these reviews. The report found that all five centers lacked documentation for some reviews, and in some cases, the required reviews weren't conducted at all. \n\nSpecifically, there were two types of reviews mentioned: Focused Professional Practice Evaluations (FPPE) for cause and retrospective reviews. For FPPEs, the report says that 26 providers didn't have documentation showing these reviews were done. Also, 21 providers' required FPPEs were never conducted. Then, there were 8 providers who didn't have documentation for retrospective reviews. One medical center had 12 providers without documentation for reviews. The report also mentions that reviews weren't timely for 16 providers, with some cases taking multiple years after concerns were raised.\n\nThe reasons given for these issues are that VHA policy doesn't require documentation for all types of reviews, including retrospective ones, and there's no timeliness requirement for initiating such reviews. Additionally, VHA's oversight of these processes is inadequate. Networks are supposed to oversee credentialing and privileging, but the report found that network officials didn't have routine oversight of these reviews. The standardized audit tool doesn't require network officials to ensure all reviews are conducted and documented. Some VISN officials weren't using the tool as required.\n\nThe report also discusses the failure to report providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards. This is because VA officials were not familiar with or misinterpreted the policies. For example, some centers didn't report providers because they were unaware of their responsibilities. Also, some officials incorrectly believed that VA couldn't report contract providers. Additionally, some centers didn't report providers because they learned that a state licensing board had already found out about the issue independently, so they didn't think they needed to report the provider.\n\nThe report concludes that these issues are due to the lack of documentation", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's November 2017 report, entitled VA Health Care: Improved Policies and Oversight Needed for Reviewing and Reporting Providers for Quality and Safety Concerns ( GAO-18-63 ). Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1743}

A joint resolution of disapproval will become effective once both houses of Congress pass a joint resolution and it is signed by the President, or if Congress overrides the President's veto. For an agency's action to be eligible for review under the CRA, it must qualify as a \"rule\" as defined by the statute. The class of rules covered by the CRA is broader than the category of rules that are subject to the Administrative Procedure Act's (APA's) notice-and-comment requirements. As such, some agency actions, such as guidance documents, that are not subject to notice-and-comment procedures may still be considered rules under the CRA and thus could be overturned using the CRA's procedures. The 115th Congress used the CRA to pass, for the first time, a resolution of disapproval overturning an agency guidance document that had not been promulgated through notice-and-comment procedures. The resolution was signed into law by the President on May 21, 2018. In all of the previous instances in which the CRA was used to overturn agency actions, the disapproved actions were regulations that had been adopted through APA rulemaking processes. Congress's use of the CRA in this instance raised questions about the scope of the CRA and Congress's ability to use the CRA to overturn agency actions that were not promulgated through APA notice-and-comment procedures. The CRA's definition of \"rule\" is based on the APA's definition, but with three exceptions. The report first describes what types of agency actions can be overturned using the CRA by providing a close examination and discussion of the statutory definition of \"rule.\" The report then explains how Members can use the CRA to overturn agency rules that have not been submitted to Congress. Under the CRA, before a rule can take effect, an agency must submit to both houses of Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) a report containing a copy of the rule and information on the rule, including a summary of the rule, a designation of whether the rule is \"major,\" and the proposed effective date of the rule.

A joint resolution of disapproval will become effective once both houses of Congress pass a joint resolution and it is signed by the President, or if Congress overrides the President's veto. The CRA generally adopts a broad definition of the word \"rule\" from the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), defining a rule as \"the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or describing the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of an agency.\" The CRA, however, provides three exceptions to this broad definition: any rule of particular applicability, including a rule that approves or prescribes for the future rates, wages, prices, services, or allowances therefor, corporate or financial structures, reorganizations, mergers, or acquisitions thereof, or accounting practices or disclosures bearing on any of the foregoing; any rule relating to agency management or personnel; or any rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice that does not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties. The class of rules the CRA covers is broader than the category of rules that are subject to the APA's notice-and-comment requirements. As such, some agency actions, such as guidance documents, that are not subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures may still be considered rules under the CRA and thus could be overturned using the CRA's procedures. The effect of Congress disapproving a rule that is not subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking may be subject to debate, given that such rules are generally viewed to lack any legal effect in the first place. Nonetheless, the CRA does encompass some such rules, as highlighted by the recent enactment of a CRA resolution overturning a bulletin from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that was not subject to the notice-and-comment procedures. Even if an agency action falls under the CRA's definition of \"rule,\" however, the expedited procedures for considering legislation to overturn the rule only become available when the agency submits the rule to Congress. In many cases in which agencies take actions that fall under the scope of a \"rule\" but have not gone through notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures, agencies fail to submit those rules. Thus, questions have arisen as to how Members can avail themselves of the CRA's special fast-track procedures if the agency has not submitted the action to Congress. To protect its prerogative to review agency rules under the CRA, Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) have developed an ad hoc process in which Members can request that GAO provide a formal legal opinion on whether a particular agency action qualifies as a rule under the CRA. If GAO concludes that the action in question falls within the CRA's definition of \"rule,\" Congress has treated the publication of the GAO opinion in the Congressional Record as constructive submission of the rule. In other words, an affirmative opinion from GAO can allow Congress to use the CRA procedures to consider legislation overturning an agency action despite the agency not submitting that action to Congress."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12318}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is about the VA's challenges in aligning their services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. \n\nFirst, there are geographic shifts in the veteran population, leading to a move from inpatient to outpatient care. This shift causes underutilized spaces in older facilities, which are expensive to modernize. The VA has a lot of vacant or underutilized buildings, many over 60 years old, and some are historic, complicating their conversion or disposal. For example, in some cases, it's more expensive to renovate than to demolish, but if the buildings are historic, demolition isn't an option. This leads to high upkeep costs and safety hazards. \n\nThen there's the issue of stakeholder involvement. The VA has not consistently engaged stakeholders, leading to adversarial relationships and making it harder to align facilities with veterans' needs. The report mentions that VA agreed with recommendations to improve stakeholder communication and evaluate efforts, but there's been little action. \n\nThe report also discusses two planning processes: SCIP and VAIP. SCIP has limitations like subjective narratives, long timeframes, and restricted access to information, which hinder the VA's ability to achieve its goals. The VAIP process assumes all future growth in services will be through VA facilities, which isn't accurate given the VA's use of non-VA providers. \n\nThe report suggests that the VA could benefit from adopting a BRAC-like process for its asset and infrastructure review, similar to how DOD did with the BRAC Commission. The BRAC process had several elements, including setting goals, developing criteria, estimating costs and savings, establishing an organizational structure, creating a common analytical framework, establishing oversight mechanisms, and involving the audit community for data accuracy. \n\nThe report also points out challenges in the BRAC process, such as the need for sustained senior leadership attention and high-level coordination among stakeholders to complete by the required date. The large number of actions and interdependent recommendations complicated the implementation process. \n\nIn the end, the report is highlighting the VA's struggles with outdated facilities, shifting healthcare needs, and limited stakeholder engagement, which are hindering their ability to realign services effectively. The report also mentions that the VA has taken some steps to address these issues, but more needs to be done. \n\nNow, I need to condense all this into a one-page summary.", "answers": ["VA operates one of the largest health care systems in the United States, utilizing more than 6,000 federally owned and 1,500 leased buildings. DOD has repeatedly applied the BRAC process to reduce the amount of unneeded property that it owns and leases and to save billions of dollars that could be applied to higher priority defense needs. This statement is based on GAO's April 2017 report related to VA facility alignment ( GAO-17-349 ) and numerous GAO reports related to the BRAC process as summarized in a June 2011 testimony ( GAO-11-704T ) and a March 2012 testimony ( GAO-12-513T ). This statement addresses (1) the factors that affect VA's facility alignment and the extent to which VA's capital-planning process facilitates the alignment of facilities with the veterans' population, and (2) the key elements and challenges affecting DOD and the Commission in BRAC 2005. Detailed information on our scope and methodologies for this work can be found in these published products, cited throughout this testimony. Geographic shifts in the veterans' population, changes in health care delivery, aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement affect the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) efforts to align its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. For example, a shift over time from inpatient to outpatient care will likely result in underutilized space once used for inpatient care. Further, the historic status of some VA facilities adds to the complexity of converting or disposing of them. In such instances, it is often difficult and costly for VA to modernize, renovate, and retrofit these older facilities. GAO reported that two of the planning processes VA uses to align its facilities—VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) and the VA Integrated Planning (VAIP)—have limitations that undermine VA's efforts to achieve its goals. Specifically: VA relies on the SCIP process to plan and prioritize capital projects, but VA routinely asks its facility planners to submit their next year's planned project narratives before knowing if their previous submissions have been funded. The overlapping budget cycle, which is outside of VA's control, combined with other SCIP limitations—including subjective narratives, long time frames, and restricted access to information—make it difficult for VA to rely on SCIP to accurately identify the capital necessary to address its service and infrastructure gaps. VA concurred that it needs to address SCIP limitations that are within its control, as GAO recommended; VA has made some progress in implementing the recommendation has made some progress in implementing the recommendation.\\ The VAIP process is estimated to cost $108 million and to produce market-level service delivery plans and facility master plans. However, the VAIP master plans incorrectly assume that all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities without considering alternatives, such as purchasing care from the community. GAO recommended that VA consider discontinuing the VAIP facility master plans pending an assessment of their value as a facility-planning tool. VA agreed with the recommendation and is implementing it while pursuing a national realignment strategy.. Key elements of the Department of Defense's (DOD) 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process could benefit VA's asset and infrastructure review. The key elements included: (1) establishing goals for the process, (2) developing criteria for evaluating closures and realignments, and (3) establishing an organizational structure to develop closure and realignment options. GAO identified key challenges that affected DOD's implementation of BRAC 2005 and the results achieved; these challenges would need to be addressed if VA is to successfully apply the process. These challenges included: (1) large, complex recommendations required sustained senior leadership's attention and a high level of coordination among many stakeholders, and (2) the large number of actions that depend on each other for successful implementation. In the April 2017 report, GAO made recommendations related to capital planning and stakeholder involvement. VA concurred with the recommendations to the extent that they were within its control and has started making improvements."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2561}
{"pred": " The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has faced significant internal control and financial management system deficiencies since its creation in 2003, which have hindered its ability to manage operations effectively. These deficiencies led to the designation of DHS’s management functions, including financial management, as high risk. To address these issues, DHS initiated a decentralized approach to upgrade or replace legacy financial management systems, including the use of federal Shared Service Providers (SSPs). The Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO), and Coast Guard (Coast Guard) were the main components of the TRIO project, which focused on migrating the financial management systems of Coast Guard, DNDO, and TSA to a modernized solution provided by IBC. DHS’s efforts to effectively assess and manage risks associated with this project are essential to DHS’s realizing its modernization goals. In 2013, OMB issued a memorandum directing agencies to consider federal SSPs as part of their AAs. Also, in May 2014, Treasury and OMB designated IBC as one of four federal SSPs for financial management to provide core accounting and other services to federal agencies. This designation was based on an evaluation of the four service providers’ ability to assist federal agencies in meeting their accounting and financial management needs, including experience with implementing financial management systems and providing other financial management services to customers, cost of services provided, compliance with financial management and internal control requirements, commitment to shared services, capacity, and long-term growth strategy. FIT’s responsibilities related to the governance and oversight of federal SSPs were subsequently transferred to USSM after USSM was established in October 2015. Because of concerns that its Core Accounting System (CAS) Suite was outdated, inefficient, and did not reliably meet requirements, Coast Guard completed an AA in January 2012 to assist in developing a path forward for modernizing its financial management system. In August 2012, Coast Guard established its CAS Replacement project team to further evaluate two of the alternatives considered in its AA and develop a recommended course of action. In addition, Coast Guard determined that hosting, owning, operating, and managing a financial management system were not among its core competencies. Because TSA and DNDO also relied on CAS as their primary accounting system, they also conducted AAs to identify the best alternative for transitioning to a modernized financial management system solution. The AAs conducted by the TRIO components during 2012 and 2013", "answers": ["To help address long-standing financial management system deficiencies, DHS initiated its TRIO project, which has focused on migrating three of its components to a modernized financial management system provided by IBC, an OMB-designated, federal SSP. House Report Number 3128 included a provision for GAO to assess the risks of DHS using IBC in connection with its modernization efforts. This report examines (1) the extent to which DHS and the TRIO components followed best practices in analyzing alternatives, and the key factors, metrics, and processes used in their choice of a modernized financial management system; (2) the extent to which DHS managed the risks of using IBC for its TRIO project consistent with risk management best practices; and (3) the key factors and challenges that have impacted the TRIO project and DHS's plans for completing remaining key priorities. GAO interviewed key officials, reviewed relevant documents, and determined whether DHS followed best practices identified by GAO as necessary characteristics of a reliable, high-quality AOA process and other risk management best practices. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) TRIO project represents a key effort to address long-standing financial management system deficiencies. During 2012 and 2013, the TRIO components—U.S. Coast Guard (Coast Guard), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO)—each completed an alternatives analysis (AA) to determine a preferred alternative for modernizing its financial management system. GAO found that DNDO's AA substantially met the four characteristics—well-documented, comprehensive, unbiased, and credible—that GAO previously identified for a reliable, high-quality analysis of alternatives (AOA) process. However, Coast Guard's and TSA's AAs did not fully or substantially meet three of these characteristics, and DHS guidance for conducting AAs did not substantially incorporate certain best practices, such as identifying significant risks and mitigation strategies and performing an independent review to help validate the AOA process. Based on these analyses and other factors, the TRIO components determined that migrating to a federal shared service provider (SSP) represented the best alternative, and in 2014, DHS selected the Department of the Interior's Interior Business Center (IBC) as the federal SSP for the project. However, because Coast Guard's and TSA's AAs did not fully or substantially reflect all of the characteristics noted above, they are at increased risk that the alternative selected may not achieve mission needs. DHS also did not fully follow best practices for managing project risks related to its use of IBC on the TRIO project. Specifically, DHS followed three of seven risk management best practices, such as determining risk sources and categories and establishing a risk management strategy. However, it did not fully follow four best practices for defining risk parameters, identifying risks, developing risk mitigation plans, and implementing these plans largely because its guidance did not sufficiently address these best practices. For example, although DHS created joint teams with IBC and provided additional resources to IBC to help address risk mitigation concerns, it did not always develop sufficiently detailed risk mitigation plans that also included contingency plans for selected critical risks. As a result, although IBC's capacity and experience for migrating large agencies the size of Coast Guard and TSA was identified as a risk in July 2014, a contingency plan working group to address this concern was not established until January 2017. By not fully following risk management best practices, DHS is at increased risk that potential problems may not be identified or properly mitigated. DHS, IBC, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and other federal oversight agencies identified various challenges that have impacted the TRIO project and contributed to a 2-year delay in the implementation of Coast Guard's and TSA's modernized solutions. These challenges include the lack of sufficient resources, aggressive schedule, complex requirements, increased costs, and project management and communication concerns. To help address these challenges, DHS and IBC established review teams and have taken other steps to assess potential mitigating steps. In May 2017, DHS determined that migrating the solution from IBC to a DHS data center represented the best option and initiated discovery efforts to further assess this as its path forward for the TRIO project. GAO recommends that DHS more fully follow best practices for conducting an AOA process and managing risks. DHS concurred with GAO's recommendations and described actions it will take, or has taken, in response."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10649}
{"pred": " The report discusses the United States' efforts to combat tax evasion through the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), which requires foreign financial institutions (FFIs) to report detailed information about their U.S. customers annually. The report highlights the importance of FATCA in efforts to combat tax evasion by U.S. persons holding investments in offshore accounts. It also discusses the requirements for reporting foreign financial accounts and other specified foreign financial assets whose aggregate value exceeds specified thresholds to IRS on Form 8938. These taxpayers must report these assets and income generated from such assets to IRS with their tax return on Form 8938. The thresholds vary by filing status—such as single or married filing jointly—and by domestic or foreign residency. FATCA also promotes third-party reporting of foreign financial assets by requiring a withholding agent to withhold 30 percent on certain payments to an FFI unless the FFI or the jurisdiction in which the FFI is located has entered into an agreement with the United States to report certain account information of their U.S. customers. Under such an agreement, participating FFIs report detailed information to IRS annually about accounts held by their U.S. customers using an IRS Form 8966, FATCA Report (Form 8966). According to IRS, FATCA improves visibility into taxable income from foreign sources, and enhances the agency’s ability to identify and pursue taxpayer noncompliance. For example, FATCA allows IRS to compare information reported by FFIs on Forms 8966 to information reported by U.S. persons on Forms 8938. This comparison can be used to ensure taxpayers and FFIs are properly reporting foreign financial assets. However, the report also identifies challenges in the data collection process, such as the lack of accurate Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TINs) from FFIs, which makes it difficult for IRS to match accounts reported by FFIs to those reported by individual tax filers. To take full advantage of the information, IRS must develop a plan to mitigate the risks that these data issues pose to agency efforts to identify and combat taxpayer noncompliance. The report also discusses the challenges faced by the IRS in collecting and managing data from individuals' electronic and paper filings of Form 8938, which are used to determine specified reporting thresholds for foreign financial assets.

House Report 114-624 included a provision for GAO to evaluate FATCA implementation and determine the effects of FATCA on U.S. citizens living abroad. GAO—among other things—(1) assessed IRS's efforts to use FATCA-related information to improve taxpayer compliance; (2) examined the extent to which Treasury administers overlapping reporting requirements on financial assets held overseas; and (3) examined the effects of FATCA implementation unique to U.S. persons living abroad. GAO reviewed applicable documentation; analyzed tax data; and interviewed officials from IRS, other federal agencies and organizations, selected tax practitioners, and more than 20 U.S. persons living overseas. Data quality and management issues have limited the effectiveness of the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) efforts to improve taxpayer compliance using foreign financial asset data collected under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). Specifically, IRS has had difficulties matching the information reported by foreign financial institutions (FFI) with U.S. taxpayers' tax filings due to missing or inaccurate Taxpayer Identification Numbers provided by FFIs. Further, IRS lacks access to consistent and complete data on foreign financial assets and other data reported in tax filings by U.S. persons, in part, because some IRS databases do not store foreign asset data reported from paper filings. IRS has also stopped pursuing a comprehensive plan to leverage FATCA data to improve taxpayer compliance because, according to IRS officials, IRS moved away from updating broad strategy documents to focus on individual compliance campaigns. Ensuring access to consistent and complete data collected from U.S. persons—and employing a plan to leverage such data—would help IRS better leverage such campaigns and increase taxpayer compliance. Due to overlapping statutory reporting requirements, IRS and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)—both within the Department of the Treasury (Treasury)—collect duplicative foreign financial account and other asset information from U.S. persons. Consequently, in tax years 2015 and 2016, close to 75 percent of U.S. persons who reported information on foreign accounts and other assets on their tax returns also filed a separate form with FinCEN. The overlapping requirements increase the compliance burden on U.S. persons and add complexity that can create confusion, potentially resulting in inaccurate or unnecessary reporting. Modifying the statutes governing the requirements to allow for the sharing of FATCA information for the prevention and detection of financial crimes would eliminate the need for duplicative reporting. This is similar to other statutory allowances for IRS to disclose return information for other purposes, such as for determining Social Security income tax withholding. According to documents GAO reviewed, and focus groups and interviews GAO conducted, FFIs closed some U.S. persons' existing accounts or denied them opportunities to open new accounts after FATCA was enacted due to increased costs, and risks they pose under FATCA reporting requirements. According to Department of State (State) data, annual approvals of renunciations of U.S. citizenship increased from 1,601 to 4,449—or nearly 178 percent—from 2011 through 2016, attributable in part to the difficulties cited above. Treasury previously established joint strategies with State to address challenges U.S. persons faced in accessing foreign financial services. However, it lacks a collaborative mechanism to coordinate efforts with other agencies to address ongoing challenges in accessing such services or obtaining Social Security Numbers. Implementation of a formal means to collaboratively address burdens faced by Americans abroad from FATCA can help federal agencies develop more effective solutions to mitigate such burdens by monitoring and sharing information on such issues, and jointly developing and implementing steps to address them. GAO is making one matter for congressional consideration to address overlap in foreign asset reporting requirements. GAO is making seven recommendations to IRS and other agencies to enhance IRS's ability to leverage FATCA data to enforce compliance, address unnecessary reporting, and better collaborate to mitigate burdens on U.S. persons living abroad.

{"pred": " The report provides an overview of the U.S. government's use of emergency and contingency-designated funding since the September 11, 2001, attacks. It highlights the significant amount of discretionary budget authority appropriated for these purposes, including $1.8 trillion for the Department of Defense (DOD), $154 billion for the Department of State and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and $3 billion for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Coast Guard. The report discusses the historical context of such funding, including the use of supplemental appropriations for war-related activities, and the evolution of the designation from \"Global War on Terror\" (GWOT) to \"Overseas Contingency Operations\" (OCO). It also examines the implications of using OCO funding for activities not directly related to war, such as the European Deterrence Initiative (EDI), and the potential for misuse of these funds. The report also discusses the role of the Budget Control Act (BCA) in setting discretionary spending limits and the impact of these limits on the U.S. government's ability to fund contingency operations. The report also highlights the debate over the appropriate use of OCO/GWOT designations, including the extent to which such designations should be used to fund activities that could reasonably be covered in regular appropriations acts. The report notes that the use of OCO/GWOT designations has become a point of contention, with some arguing that these funds should only be used to respond to unforeseen events, while others believe they should also provide funding for activities that could reasonably be covered in regular appropriations acts. The report also discusses the role of the President in designating such funding, and the implications of using OCO/GWOT designations to effectively exempt funding from the BCA limits on discretionary defense spending. The report concludes that the reliance on OCO/GWOT designations has created problems and distortions of its own, with some analysts suggesting that the lack of predictability and the limitations on what OCO funds can be used to buy could be detrimental to national security on three levels: (a) by undermining budget controls and contributing thereby to larger deficits, (b) by generating insecurity in the defense workforce and in defense suppliers, and (c) by creating long-term uncertainty in defense planning. The report also highlights the need for Congress to properly question the DOD budget planners on the future of OCO, given the current reliance on OCO to fund war-related activities and the potential", "answers": ["Congressional interest in Overseas Contingency Operation (OCO) funding has continued as Members debate ways of funding priorities without breaching discretionary spending limits set in law. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress has appropriated approximately $2 trillion in discretionary budget authority designated as emergency requirements or for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism (OCO/GWOT) in support of the broad U.S. government response to the 9/11 attacks and for other related international affairs activities. This figure amounts to approximately 9.4% of total discretionary spending during this period. Congress has used supplemental appropriation acts or designated funding for emergency requirements or OCO/GWOT—or both—in statute. These funds are not subject to limits on discretionary spending in congressional budget resolutions or to the statutory discretionary spending limits established by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-125). The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA; P.L. 99-177) allows emergency funding to be excluded from budget control limits. The BCA added the OCO/GWOT designation to the BBEDCA exemption, thereby providing Congress and the President with an alternate way to exclude funding from the BCA spending limits. While there is no overall statutory limit on the amount of emergency or OCO/GWOT spending, both Congress and the President have fundamental roles in determining how much of the spending to provide each fiscal year. Congress must designate any such funding in statute on an account-by-account basis. The President is also required to designate it as such after it is appropriated to be available for expenditure. Debate over what should constitute OCO/GWOT or emergency activities and expenses has shifted over time, reflecting differing viewpoints about the extent, nature, and duration of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere. Funding designated for OCO/GWOT has also been used to fund base-budget requirements of the DOD and State Department and to prevent or respond to crises abroad, including armed conflict, as well as human-caused and natural disasters. Some defense officials and policymakers argue OCO funding allows for flexible response to contingencies, and provides a \"safety valve\" to the spending caps and threat of sequestration—the automatic cancellation of budget authority largely through across-the-board reductions of nonexempt programs and activities—under the BCA. Critics, however, have described OCO/GWOT as a loophole or \"gimmick\"—morphing from an account for replacing combat losses of equipment, resupplying expended munitions, and transporting troops through war zones, to a \"slush fund\" for activities unrelated to contingency operations. Congress appropriated approximately $103 billion for OCO in FY2017 (8.5% of all discretionary appropriations), $78 billion for OCO in FY2018 (5.5% of all discretionary appropriations), and $68.8 billion for OCO so far in FY2019. Discretionary appropriations for FY2019 are not yet final; a continuing resolution expired December 21, 2018. Following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123), which raised discretionary budget caps for defense and foreign affairs agencies in FY2018 and FY2019, the Administration proposed shifting some OCO funding into the base, or regular, budget. Although Congress has generally not followed Administration requests for reduced funding for foreign affairs and domestic activities and has increased funding for defense, the President has asked cabinet secretaries to propose spending cuts of 5% in FY2020. Such proposals, if requested in a budget submission, may create difficult choices for Congress in FY2020 and FY2021—the final two years of the BCA discretionary spending limits.

It has a history of political instability and armed conflict, especially in the east. The report mentions the \"Africa's World War\" from 1998 to 2003, which caused a lot of deaths. There's ongoing violence in the east, with illegal armed groups and some military members involved. The report also notes that in 2012, an illegal armed group occupied Goma and other cities, leading to clashes with the national army. During this time, the UN reported numerous cases of sexual violence against civilians, including women and children, by armed groups and some members of the Congolese national military. In 2017, the UN reported that serious violations of human rights remain widespread in the DRC, including continued acts of sexual violence by government security forces as well as nonstate armed groups.\n\nThen there's the part about conflict minerals and their use in various industries. The report explains that tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold are used in products like electronics, automotive parts, etc. The Dodd-Frank Act's Section 1502(b) led to the SEC's conflict minerals disclosure rule, which requires companies to disclose the source of these minerals. The rule outlines a process for companies to determine if they use conflict minerals, conduct a country-of-origin inquiry, and exercise due diligence. \n\nThe report also discusses the 2017 SEC review of company disclosures. It found that most companies were able to perform the required inquiries, but challenges remained in determining the country of origin. Companies also faced difficulties in determining whether the conflict minerals financed or benefited armed groups. \n\nAdditionally, the report includes data on sexual violence in the DRC and neighboring countries. It mentions population-based surveys from Uganda and Burundi in 2016 and 2017, which provided data on the prevalence of sexual violence. The report also mentions case-file data from the DRC, including instances of sexual violence by illegal armed groups and some members of the Congole", "answers": ["Over the past decade, the United States and the international community have sought to improve security in the DRC. In the eastern DRC, armed groups have committed severe human rights abuses, including sexual violence, and reportedly profit from the exploitation of “conflict minerals”— in particular, tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold, according to the United Nations. Congress included a provision in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that, among other things, required the SEC to promulgate regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals from the DRC and adjoining countries. The SEC adopted these regulations in 2012. The act also included a provision for GAO to annually assess the SEC regulations' effectiveness in promoting peace and security and report on the rate of sexual violence in the DRC and adjoining countries. In this report, GAO provides information about (1) companies' conflict minerals disclosures filed with the SEC in 2017 compared with disclosures filed in the prior 2 years and (2) the rate of sexual violence in the eastern DRC and adjoining countries published in 2017 and early 2018. GAO analyzed a generalizable random sample of SEC filings and interviewed relevant officials. GAO reviewed U.S., United Nations, and international organizations' reports; interviewed DRC officials, and other stakeholders; and conducted fieldwork in New York at the United Nations headquarters. GAO is not making any recommendations. GAO's review of companies' conflict minerals disclosures filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2017 found that, in general, they were similar to disclosures filed in the prior 2 years. In 2017, 1,165 companies filed conflict minerals disclosures—about the same as in 2016 and 2015. Percentages of companies reporting country-of-origin inquiries in 2017 were also similar to the percentages from those 2 prior years. As a result of the inquiries they conducted, an estimated 53 percent of companies reported in 2017 whether the conflict minerals in their products came from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries—similar to the estimated 49 percent in 2016 and 2015 but significantly higher than the estimate of 30 percent in 2014 (see figure). In their 2017 disclosure reports, many companies described actions they took to improve data collection processes, and most companies indicated some challenges in determining the country of origin. Similar to the prior 2 years, almost all companies required to conduct due diligence, as a result of their country-of-origin inquiries, reported doing so. After conducting due diligence to determine the source and chain of custody of any conflict minerals used, an estimated 37 percent of these companies reported in 2017 that they were able to determine that their conflict minerals came from covered countries or from scrap or recycled sources, compared with 39 and 23 percent in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Four companies in GAO's sample declared their products “DRC conflict-free,” and of those, three included the required Independent Private Sector Audit report (IPSA), and one did not. In 2017, 16 companies filed an IPSA; 19 did so in 2016. GAO found information on the rate of sexual violence in the 2017 Uganda and Burundi Demographic and Health Surveys. For Uganda, 22 percent of women and 9 percent of men reported they had experienced sexual violence at least once in their lifetime. For Burundi, 23 percent of women and 6 percent of men reported they had experienced sexual violence at least once in their lifetime.

In 2017, the President issued executive actions directing agencies to improve visa screening and vetting, and establishing nationality-based visa entry restrictions, which the Supreme Court upheld in June 2018. GAO was asked to review NIV screening and vetting. This report examines (1) outcomes and characteristics of adjudicated NIV applications from fiscal years 2012 through 2017, and (2) key changes made to the NIV adjudication process in response to executive actions taken in 2017. GAO analyzed State NIV adjudication data for fiscal years 2012 through 2017, the most recent and complete data available. GAO visited seven consular posts selected based on visa workload and other factors. GAO reviewed relevant executive orders and proclamations, and documents related to implementing these actions. This is a public version of a sensitive report issued in June 2018. Information that DHS, State, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence deemed sensitive has been removed. The total number of nonimmigrant visa (NIV) applications that Department of State (State) consular officers adjudicated annually peaked at about 13.4 million in fiscal year 2016, and decreased by about 880,000 adjudications in fiscal year 2017. NIV adjudications varied by visa group, country of nationality, and refusal reason: Visa group. From fiscal years 2012 through 2017, about 80 percent of NIV adjudications were for tourists and business visitors. During this time, adjudications for temporary workers increased by about 50 percent and decreased for students and exchange visitors by about 2 percent. Country of nationality. In fiscal year 2017, more than half of all NIV adjudications were for applicants of six countries of nationality: China (2.02 million, or 16 percent), Mexico (1.75 million, or 14 percent), India (1.28 million, or 10 percent), Brazil (670,000, or 5 percent), Colombia (460,000, or 4 percent), and Argentina (370,000, or 3 percent). Refusal reason. State data indicate that over this time period, 18 percent of adjudicated applications were refused; more than 90 percent were because the applicant did not qualify for the visa sought, and a small percentage (0.05 percent) were due to terrorism and security-related concerns. In 2017, two executive orders and a proclamation issued by the President required, among other actions, visa entry restrictions for nationals of certain listed countries of concern, the development of uniform baseline screening and vetting standards, and changes to NIV screening and vetting procedures. GAO's analysis of State data indicates that, out of the nearly 2.8 million NIV applications refused in fiscal year 2017, 1,338 applications were refused due to visa entry restrictions implemented per the executive actions. State, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and others developed standards for screening and vetting by the U.S. government for all immigration benefits, such as for the requirement for applicants to undergo certain security checks. Further, State sought and received emergency approval from the Office of Management and Budget in May 2017 to develop a new form to collect additional information from some visa applicants, such as email addresses and social media handles."], "all_classes": null, "length": 11506}
{"pred": " The report discusses the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) approach to collecting broadband availability data and its accuracy in reflecting the ability of Americans living on tribal lands to access broadband Internet services. The report highlights that the FCC's current method of collecting broadband data, primarily through the Form 477 process, does not accurately or completely capture broadband access on tribal lands. This leads to overstatements of availability, as the data may not account for factors such as affordability, quality of service, and service denials. The report also notes that the FCC lacks a formal process to obtain input from tribal governments on the accuracy of provider-submitted broadband data. This is a significant issue because it means that the FCC is missing an important source of information regarding areas where the data may overstate broadband service on tribal lands. The report also discusses the importance of collecting more granular data on broadband availability, as this would allow for more accurate assessments of broadband access on tribal lands. The report concludes that without taking these steps, the FCC increases the risk that residents living on tribal lands will continue to lack broadband access. The report also recommends that the FCC develop a formal process to obtain tribal input on the accuracy of provider-submitted broadband data, including outreach and technical assistance to help tribes participate in the process. The report further recommends that the FCC obtain feedback from tribal stakeholders and providers on the effectiveness of the FCC's 2012 statement to providers on how to fulfill their tribal engagement requirements to determine whether the agency needs to clarify its tribal engagement statement.

(", "answers": ["Broadband furthers economic development, educational attainment, and public health and safety; however, residents of tribal lands have lower levels of broadband access relative to the U.S. population. Congress has prioritized identifying and targeting funds to unserved areas. FCC uses data from broadband providers to develop maps and reports depicting broadband availability in the United States, with specific information on tribal lands. GAO was asked to review FCC's efforts to collect broadband data for tribal lands. This report examines the extent to which: (1) FCC's approach to collecting broadband data accurately captures broadband access on tribal lands and (2) FCC obtains tribal input on the data. GAO interviewed stakeholders from 25 tribal governments or tribally owned providers, and visited nine tribal lands. The selected tribes varied geographically and in levels of broadband availability, among other characteristics. GAO also reviewed FCC's rulemakings on broadband data and interviewed other tribal stakeholders, FCC officials, and 13 non-tribal broadband providers selected to include a diversity of technologies. Provider and tribal interviews were based on non-generalizable samples. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) collects data on broadband availability from providers, but these data do not accurately or completely capture broadband access on tribal lands. Specifically, FCC collects data on broadband availability; these data capture where providers may have broadband infrastructure. However, FCC considers broadband to be “available” for an entire census block if the provider could serve at least one location in the census block. This leads to overstatements of service for specific locations like tribal lands (see figure). FCC, tribal stakeholders, and providers have noted that this approach leads to overstatements of broadband availability. Because FCC uses these data to measure broadband access, it also overstates broadband access—the ability to obtain service—on tribal lands. Additionally, FCC does not collect information on several factors—such as affordability, quality, and denials of service—that FCC and tribal stakeholders stated can affect the extent to which Americans living on tribal lands can access broadband services. FCC provides broadband funding for unserved areas based on its broadband data. Overstatements of access limit FCC's and tribal stakeholders' abilities to target broadband funding to such areas. For example, some tribal officials stated that inaccurate data have affected their ability to plan their own broadband networks and obtain funding to address broadband gaps on their lands. By developing and implementing methods for collecting and reporting accurate and complete data on broadband access specific to tribal lands, FCC would be better able to target federal broadband funding to tribal areas that need it the most and to more accurately assess FCC's progress toward its goal of increasing all Americans' access to affordable broadband. FCC does not have a formal process to obtain tribal input on the accuracy of provider-submitted broadband data. In the National Broadband Plan , FCC highlighted the need for a targeted approach to improve broadband availability data for tribal lands. As outlined in the plan, such an approach would include working with tribes to ensure that information is accurate and useful. About half of the tribal stakeholders GAO interviewed raised concerns that FCC relies solely on data from providers, and most stated FCC should work with tribes to improve the accuracy of FCC's data. Establishing a formal process to obtain input from tribal governments on the accuracy of provider-submitted broadband data could help improve the accuracy of FCC's broadband data for tribal lands. GAO is making three recommendations to FCC, including that it collect and report data that accurately measure tribal broadband access as well as develop a process to obtain tribal input on the accuracy of the data.

Smaller community banks and credit unions must comply with some of the regulations, but compliance can be more challenging and costly for these institutions. GAO examined (1) the regulations community banks and credit unions viewed as most burdensome and why, and (2) efforts by depository institution regulators to reduce any regulatory burden. GAO analyzed regulations and interviewed more than 60 community banks and credit unions (selected based on asset size and financial activities), regulators, and industry associations and consumer groups. GAO also analyzed letters and transcripts commenting on regulatory burden that regulators prepared responding to the comments. Interviews and focus groups GAO conducted with representatives of over 60 community banks and credit unions indicated regulations for reporting mortgage characteristics, reviewing transactions for potentially illicit activity, and disclosing mortgage terms and costs to consumers were the most burdensome. Institution representatives said these regulations were time-consuming and costly to comply with, in part because the requirements were complex, required individual reports that had to be reviewed for accuracy, or mandated actions within specific timeframes. However, regulators and others noted that the regulations were essential to preventing lending discrimination and use of the banking system for illicit activity, and they were acting to reduce compliance burdens. Institution representatives also said that the new mortgage disclosure regulations increased compliance costs, added significant time to loan closings, and resulted in institutions absorbing costs when others, such as appraisers and inspectors, changed disclosed fees. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued guidance and conducted other outreach to educate institutions after issuing these regulations in 2013. But GAO found that some compliance burdens arose from misunderstanding the disclosure regulations—which in turn may have led institutions to take actions not actually required. Assessing the effectiveness of the guidance for the disclosure regulations could help mitigate the misunderstandings and thus also reduce compliance burdens. Regulators of community banks and credit unions—the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the National Credit Union Administration—conduct decennial reviews to obtain industry comments on regulatory burden. But the reviews, conducted under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 (EGRPRA), had the following limitations: CFPB and the consumer financial regulations for which it is responsible were not included. Unlike executive branch agencies, the depository institution regulators are not required to analyze and report quantitative-based rationales for their responses to comments. Regulators do not assess the cumulative burden of the regulations they administer. CFPB has formed an internal group that will be tasked with reviewing regulations it administers, but the agency has not publicly announced the scope of regulations included, the timing and frequency of the reviews, and the extent to which they will be coordinated with the other federal banking and credit union regulators as part of their periodic EGRPRA reviews. Congressional intent in mandating that these regulators review their regulations was that the cumulative effect of all federal financial regulations be considered. In addition, sound practices required of other federal agencies require them to analyze and report their assessments when reviewing regulations. Documenting in plans how the depository institution regulators would address these EGRPRA limitations would better ensure that all regulations relevant to community banks and credit unions were reviewed, likely improve the analyses the regulators perform, and potentially result in additional burden reduction. GAO makes a total of 10 recommendations to CFPB and the depository institution regulators. CFPB should assess the effectiveness of guidance on mortgage disclosure regulations and publicly issue its plans for the scope and timing of its regulation reviews and coordinate these with the other regulators' review process. As part of their burden reviews, the depository institution regulators should develop plans to report quantitative rationales for their actions and addressing the cumulative burden of regulations.

{"pred": " The report provides an in-depth analysis of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and its Grants Management Modernization (GMM) program. FEMA is responsible for providing assistance to communities before, during, and after disasters and terrorist attacks by supplying immediate needs (e.g., ice, water, food, and temporary housing) and providing financial assistance grants for damage to personal or public property. Additionally, FEMA provides non-disaster assistance grants to improve the nation's preparedness, readiness, and resilience to all hazards. The GMM program is intended to modernize and streamline FEMA's grants management environment, which is highly complex with many stakeholders, IT systems, and users. FEMA has identified 10 primary legacy IT systems that support its grants management activities. These systems were developed to support specific grant programs or categories and are not interoperable. As a result, individual grant programs and regional offices have independently developed workarounds to address existing capability gaps with the primary systems. These workarounds are often non-standardized processes, and introduce the potential for information security risks and errors. This environment has contributed to labor-intensive manual processes and an increased burden for grant recipients. The report also highlights challenges with FEMA's past attempts to modernize its grant management systems. For example, in December 2006, the DHS OIG reported that EMMIE, an effort to modernize its grants management systems and provide a single grants processing solution, was being developed without a clear understanding and definition of the future solution. The report also identified the need to ensure crosscutting participation from headquarters, regions, and states in developing and maintaining a complete, documented set of FEMA business and system requirements. The GMM program has established a standard framework intended to represent a common grants management lifecycle. This framework consists of five sequential phases—pre-award, award, post-award, closeout, and post-closeout—along with a sixth phase dedicated to continuous grant program management activities, such as analyzing data and producing reports on grant awards and managing IT systems. The GMM program is expected to be implemented within the complex IT environment that currently exists at FEMA. For example, the program is intended to replace the 10 legacy grants management systems, and potentially many additional subsystems, with a single IT system. Each of the 10 legacy systems was developed with its own database(s) and with no standardization of the grants management data and, according to FEMA officials, this legacy data has grown significantly over time. As a result, individual grant programs and regional", "answers": ["FEMA, a component of DHS, annually awards billions of dollars in grants to help communities prepare for, mitigate the effects of, and recover from major disasters. However, FEMA's complex IT environment supporting grants management consists of many disparate systems. In 2008, the agency attempted to modernize these systems but experienced significant challenges. In 2015, FEMA initiated a new endeavor (the GMM program) aimed at streamlining and modernizing the grants management IT environment. GAO was asked to review the GMM program. GAO's objectives were to (1) determine the extent to which FEMA is implementing leading practices for reengineering its grants management processes and incorporating needs into IT requirements; (2) assess the reliability of the program's estimated costs and schedule; and (3) determine the extent to which FEMA is addressing key cybersecurity practices. GAO compared program documentation to leading practices for process reengineering and requirements management, cost and schedule estimation, and cybersecurity risk management, as established by the Software Engineering Institute, National Institute of Standards and Technology, and GAO. Of six important leading practices for effective business process reengineering and information technology (IT) requirements management, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) fully implemented four and partially implemented two for the Grants Management Modernization (GMM) program (see table). Specifically, FEMA ensured senior leadership commitment, took steps to assess its business environment and performance goals, took recent actions to track progress in delivering IT requirements, and incorporated input from end user stakeholders. However, FEMA has not yet fully established plans for implementing new business processes or established complete traceability of IT requirements. Until FEMA fully implements the remaining two practices, it risks delivering an IT solution that does not fully modernize FEMA's grants management systems. While GMM's initial May 2017 cost estimate of about $251 million was generally consistent with leading practices for a reliable, high-quality estimate, it no longer reflects current assumptions about the program. FEMA officials stated in December 2018 that they had completed a revised cost estimate, but it was undergoing departmental approval. GMM's program schedule was inconsistent with leading practices; of particular concern was that the program's final delivery date of September 2020 was not informed by a realistic assessment of GMM development activities, and rather was determined by imposing an unsubstantiated delivery date. Developing sound cost and schedule estimates is necessary to ensure that FEMA has a clear understanding of program risks. Of five key cybersecurity practices, FEMA fully addressed three and partially addressed two for GMM. Specifically, it categorized GMM's system based on security risk, selected and implemented security controls, and monitored security controls on an ongoing basis. However, the program had not initially established corrective action plans for 13 medium- and low-risk vulnerabilities. This conflicts with the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) guidance that specifies that corrective action plans must be developed for every weakness identified. Until FEMA, among other things, ensures that the program consistently follows the department's guidance on preparing corrective action plans for all security vulnerabilities, GMM's system will remain at increased risk of exploits.

{"pred": " The Clean Water Act (CWA) has been a cornerstone of federal efforts to support municipal wastewater treatment plant construction and related infrastructure projects. Initially authorized in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, the CWA established a grants program administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This program, initially funded through annual appropriations under a state-by-state allocation formula, aimed to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation's waters. The federal share of project costs was initially 75% under P.L. 92-500 but was reduced to 55% in 1981. By the mid-1980s, there was significant debate over the future of the CWA's construction grants program, with the Reagan Administration seeking to phase out federal involvement in funding municipal water infrastructure projects. Congress responded with the 1987 amendments to the CWA, which authorized a combination of the Title II grants program and a new State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds program (CWSRF). The CWSRF program was phased in beginning in FY1989 and entirely replaced the previous Title II program in FY1991. The intention was that states would have flexibility to set priorities and administer funding, while federal aid would end after FY1994. However, the authorizations for appropriations expired in FY1994, but pressure to extend federal funding has continued, in part because, although Congress has appropriated $98 billion in CWA Title II and Title VI wastewater infrastructure assistance since 1972, funding needs remain high: According to the most recent formal estimate by EPA and states (prepared in 2016), an additional $271 billion nationwide is needed over the next 20 years for all types of projects eligible for funding under the act. Congress has continued to appropriate funds, and continued to assist states and localities in meeting wastewater infrastructure needs and complying with CWA requirements. In 1996, Congress established a parallel program under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) to help communities finance projects needed to comply with federal drinking water regulations. Funding support for drinking water occurred for several reasons. First, until the 1980s, the number of drinking water regulations was fairly small, and public water systems often did not need to make large investments in treatment technologies to meet those regulations. Second, good quality drinking water traditionally has been available to many communities at relatively", "answers": ["The principal federal program to aid municipal wastewater treatment plant construction is authorized in the Clean Water Act (CWA). Established as a grant program in 1972, it now capitalizes state loan programs through the clean water state revolving loan fund (CWSRF) program. Since FY1972, appropriations have totaled $98 billion. In 1996, Congress amended the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA, P.L. 104-182) to authorize a similar state loan program for drinking water to help systems finance projects needed to comply with drinking water regulations and to protect public health. Since FY1997, appropriations for the drinking water state revolving loan fund (DWSRF) program have totaled $23 billion. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administers both SRF programs, which annually distribute funds to the states for implementation. Funding amounts are specified in the State and Tribal Assistance Grants (STAG) account of EPA annual appropriations acts. The combined appropriations for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure assistance have represented 25%-32% of total funds appropriated to EPA in recent years. Prior to CWA amendments in 1987 (P.L. 100-4), Congress provided wastewater grant funding directly to municipalities. The federal share of project costs was generally 55%; state and local governments were responsible for the remaining 45%. The 1987 amendments replaced this grant program with the SRF program. Local communities are now often responsible for 100% of project costs, rather than 45%, as they are required to repay loans to states. The greater financial burden of the act's loan program on some cities has caused some to seek continued grant funding. Although the CWSRF and DWSRF have largely functioned as loan programs, both allow the implementing state agency to provide \"additional subsidization\" under certain conditions. Since its amendments in 1996, the SDWA has authorized states to use up to 30% of their DWSRF capitalization grants to provide additional assistance, such as forgiveness of loan principal or negative interest rate loans, to help disadvantaged communities. America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 (AWIA; P.L. 115-270) increased this proportion to 35% while conditionally requiring states to use at least 6% of their capitalization grants for these purposes. Congress amended the CWA in 2014, adding similar provisions to the CWSRF program. In addition, appropriations acts in recent years have required states to use minimum percentages of their allotted SRF grants to provide additional subsidization. Final full-year appropriations were enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2019 (P.L. 116-6), on February 15, 2019. The act provided $1.694 billion for the CWSRF and $1.163 billion for the DWSRF program, nearly identical to the FY2018 appropriations. The FY0219 act provided $68 million for the WIFIA program, a $5 million increase from the FY2018 appropriation.

It also explores what is known about the extent to which men and women may be offered different prices or experience different levels of access to markets for credit and goods and services that are not differentiated by gender. The report finds that in 5 out of 10 personal care product categories analyzed, women's versions sold at a statistically significant higher average price than men's versions after controlling for certain observable factors. For 2 of the 10 product categories, men’s versions sold at a statistically significant higher price. The factors controlled for included product size, promotional expenses, and other product-specific attributes such as scent, special claims, and form. However, the report could not determine the extent to which the gender-based price differences observed may be attributed to gender bias as opposed to other factors. The report also found that the target gender for a product is a significant factor contributing to price differences identified, but the report does not have sufficient information to determine the extent to which these gender-related price differences were due to gender bias as opposed to other factors. The report also discusses the conditions necessary for firms to implement a strategy of price differentiation, which likely exist for the personal care products analyzed. These conditions include industry concentration, market power, and the ability to segment the market for personal care products by tailoring product characteristics related to gender. The report also discusses the extent to which consumers may pay different prices for the same or similar goods and services, which can depend on factors such as willingness to pay, ability to compare prices, and choices about where to purchase the item. The report concludes that while there are no federal laws expressly prohibiting businesses from charging different prices for the same or similar consumer goods and services targeted to men and women, consumer protection laws do prohibit sex discrimination in credit and real estate transactions. Specifically, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits creditors from discriminating against credit applicants based on sex or certain other characteristics and the Fair Housing Act (FHA) prohibits discrimination in the housing market on the basis of sex or certain other characteristics. The report also discusses the extent to which federal agencies have identified and taken steps to address any concerns about gender-related price differences. For example, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (BCFP), Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and Department of Justice (DOJ) have the authority to investigate alleged violations of ECOA and are primarily responsible for enforcing the act’s requirements.

While variation in costs and consumer demand may give rise to such price differences, some policymakers have raised concerns that gender bias may also be a factor. While the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Fair Housing Act prohibit discrimination based on sex in credit and housing transactions, no federal law prohibits businesses from charging consumers different prices for the same or similar goods targeted to different genders. GAO was asked to review gender-related price differences for consumer goods and services sold in the United States. This report examines, among other things, (1) how prices compared for selected goods and services marketed to men and women, and potential reasons for any price differences; (2) what is known about price differences for men and women for products not differentiated by gender, such as mortgages; and (3) the extent to which federal agencies have identified and addressed any concerns about gender-related price differences. To examine these issues, GAO analyzed retail price data, reviewed relevant academic studies, analyzed federal consumer complaint data, and interviewed federal agency officials, industry experts, and academics. Firms differentiate many consumer products to appeal separately to men and women by slightly altering product attributes like color or scent. Products differentiated by gender may sell for different prices if men and women have different demands or willingness to pay for these product attributes. Of 10 personal care product categories (e.g., deodorants and shaving products) that GAO analyzed, average retail prices paid were significantly higher for women's products than for men's in 5 categories. In 2 categories—shaving gel and nondisposable razors—men's versions sold at a significantly higher price. One category—razor blades--had mixed results based on two price measures analyzed, and two others—disposable razors and mass-market perfumes—showed no significant gender price differences. GAO found that the target gender for a product is a significant factor contributing to price differences identified, but GAO did not have sufficient information to determine the extent to which these gender-related price differences were due to gender bias as opposed to other factors, such as different advertising costs. Though the analysis controlled for several observable product attributes, such as product size and packaging type, all underlying differences in costs and demand for products targeted to different genders could not be fully observed. Studies GAO reviewed found limited evidence of gender price differences for four products or services not differentiated by gender—mortgages, small business credit, auto purchases, and auto repairs. For example, with regard to mortgages, women as a group paid higher average mortgage rates than men, in part due to weaker credit characteristics, such as lower average income. However, after controlling for borrower credit characteristics and other factors, three studies did not find statistically significant differences in borrowing costs between men and women, while one found women paid higher rates for certain subprime loans. In addition, one study found that female borrowers defaulted less frequently than male borrowers with similar credit characteristics, and the study suggested that women may pay higher mortgage rates than men relative to their default risk. While these studies controlled for factors other than gender that could affect borrowing costs, several lacked important data on certain borrower risk characteristics, such as credit scores, which could affect analysis of gender disparities. Also, several studies analyzed small samples of subprime loans that were originated in 2005 or earlier, which limits the generalizability of the results. In their oversight of federal antidiscrimination statutes, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, Federal Trade Commission, and Department of Housing and Urban Development have identified limited consumer concerns based on gender-related pricing differences. GAO's analysis of complaint data received by the three agencies from 2012–2017 found that they had received limited consumer complaints about gender-related price differences. The agencies provide general consumer education resources on discrimination and consumer awareness.

{"pred": " The report provides an overview of the U.S. hydropower industry, focusing on the regulatory framework and safety oversight by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). According to the National Inventory of Dams, there are approximately 90,500 dams in the United States, with about 2,100 associated with hydropower projects. These projects are owned and operated by both non-federal entities, such as private utility companies, municipalities, and state government agencies, or federal government agencies, primarily the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) and the Bureau of Reclamation. Hydropower projects account for about 8 percent of the total electric generating capacity in the United States. FERC regulates a portfolio of about 1,000 non-federal hydropower projects comprising over 2,500 dams. While FERC does not construct, own, or operate dams, it licenses and provides oversight of non-federal hydropower projects to promote their safe operation. Licensees are responsible for the safety and liability of dams, pursuant to the Federal Power Act, and for their continuous upkeep and repair using sound and prudent engineering practices. FERC officials in each of the agency’s five regional offices work directly with licensees to help ensure these projects comply with licenses and meet federal guidelines for dam safety. Stakeholder groups such as the Association of State Dam Safety Officials can assist licensees in staying current on federal and state dam laws and regulations, dam operations and maintenance practices, and emergency action planning, among other things. FERC’s regulations, supplemented by its Operating Manual and Engineering Guidelines, establish a framework for its dam safety oversight approach. The Operating Manual provides guidelines for the FERC staff performing inspections that are aimed at ensuring that structures are safe, are being properly maintained, and are being operated safely. The Engineering Guidelines provides FERC staff and licensees with procedures and criteria for the review and analysis of license applications, project modification proposals, technical studies, and dam designs. For example, one chapter presents guidelines for FERC staff to use to determine the appropriateness and level of geotechnical investigations and studies for dams. The Engineering Guidelines states that every dam is unique and that safety analysis of each dam require that engineers apply technical judgement based on their professional experience. As part of FERC’s safety oversight approach, it assigns a hazard classification to each dam in accordance with federal guidelines that consider the potential human or economic consequences of the dam’s failure. The hazard classification does not indicate the structural integrity", "answers": ["In February 2017, components of California's Oroville Dam failed, leading to the evacuation of nearly 200,000 nearby residents.

FERC issues and renews licenses—which can last up to 50 years—to dam operators and promotes safe dam operation by conducting safety inspections and reviewing technical engineering studies, among other actions. GAO was asked to review FERC's approach to overseeing dam safety. This report examines: (1) how FERC collects information from its dam safety inspections and the extent of its analysis, and (2) how FERC evaluates engineering studies of dam performance to analyze safety, among other objectives. GAO analyzed documentation on a non-generalizable sample of 42 dams associated with projects relicensed from fiscal years 2014 through 2017, selected based on geography and hazard classifications, among other factors. GAO also reviewed FERC regulations and documents; and interviewed FERC staff associated with the selected projects and technical consultants, selected based on the frequency and timing of their reviews. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) staff generally followed established guidance in collecting safety information from dam inspections for the dams GAO reviewed, but FERC has not used this information to analyze dam safety portfolio-wide. For these 42 dams, GAO found that FERC staff generally followed guidance in collecting safety information during inspections of individual dams and key structures associated with those dams. (See figure.) However, FERC lacks standard procedures that specify how and where staff should record safety deficiencies identified. As a result, FERC staff use multiple systems to record inspection findings, thereby creating information that cannot be easily analyzed. Further, while FERC officials said inspections help oversee individual dam's safety, FERC has not analyzed this information to identify any safety risks across its portfolio. GAO's prior work has highlighted the importance of evaluating risks across a portfolio. FERC officials stated that they have not conducted portfolio-wide analyses because officials prioritize the individual dam inspections and response to urgent dam safety incidents. However, following the Oroville incident, a FERC-led initiative to examine dam structures comparable to those at Oroville identified 27 dam spillways with varying degrees of safety concerns, on which FERC officials stated they are working with dam licensees to address. A similar and proactive portfolio-wide approach, based on analysis of common inspection deficiencies across the portfolio of dams under FERC's authority, could help FERC identify safety risks prior to a safety incident. Guidelines recognize that each dam is unique and allow for flexibility and exemptions in its use. FERC staff use the studies to inform other components of their safety approach, including the analysis of dam failure scenarios and their review of safety to determine whether to renew a license. GAO recommends that FERC: (1) develop standard procedures for recording information collected as part of its inspections, and (2) use inspection information to assess safety risks across FERC's portfolio of dams. FERC agreed with GAO's recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8621}
{"pred": " \n\nThe report provides an overview of the federal child nutrition programs, which are designed to improve children's nutrition and support the agriculture economy. These programs include the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), School Breakfast Program (SBP), Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), Summer Food Service Program (SFSP), and Special Milk Program (SMP). The programs provide financial support and/or foods to the institutions that prepare meals and snacks served outside of the home, unlike other food assistance programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) where benefits are used to purchase food for home consumption. The child nutrition programs refer primarily to the following meal, snack, and milk reimbursement programs (these and other acronyms are listed in Appendix A): National School Lunch Program (NSLP) (Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.)); School Breakfast Program (SBP) (Child Nutrition Act, Section 4 (42 U.S.C. 1773)); Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) (Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act, Section 17 (42 U.S.C. 1766)); Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) (Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act, Section 13 (42 U.S.C. 1761)); and Special Milk Program (SMP) (Child Nutrition Act, Section 3 (42 U.S.C. 1772)). The programs provide financial support and/or foods to the institutions that prepare meals and snacks served outside of the home (unlike other food assistance programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) where benefits are used to purchase food for home consumption). Though exact eligibility rules and pricing vary by program, in general the amount of federal reimbursement is greater for meals served to qualifying low-income individuals or at qualifying institutions, although most programs provide some subsidy for all food served. Participating children receive subsidized meals and snacks, which may be free or at reduced price. The report discusses how program-specific eligibility rules and funding operate, focusing on eligibility rules, participation, and funding for each program. This introductory section describes some of the background and principles that generally apply to all of the programs; subsequent sections go into further detail on the workings of each. Unless stated otherwise, participation and funding data come from USDA-FNS's \"Keydata Reports.\" The child nutrition programs are most often dated back to the", "answers": ["The \"child nutrition programs\" refer to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service (USDA-FNS) programs that provide food for children in school or institutional settings. The best known programs, which serve the largest number of children, are the school meals programs: the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and the School Breakfast Program (SBP). The child nutrition programs also include the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), which provides meals and snacks in day care and after school settings; the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP), which provides food during the summer months; the Special Milk Program (SMP), which supports milk for schools that do not participate in NSLP or SBP; and the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP), which funds fruit and vegetable snacks in select elementary schools. Funding: The vast majority of the child nutrition programs account is considered mandatory spending, with trace amounts of discretionary funding for certain related activities. Referred to as open-ended, \"appropriated entitlements,\" funding is provided through the annual appropriations process; however, the level of spending is controlled by benefit and eligibility criteria in federal law and dependent on the resulting levels of participation. Federal cash funding (in the form of per-meal reimbursements) and USDA commodity food support is guaranteed to schools and other providers based on the number of meals or snacks served and participant category (e.g., free meals for poor children get higher subsidies). Participation: The child nutrition programs serve children of varying ages and in different institutional settings. The NSLP and SBP have the broadest reach, serving qualifying children of all ages in school settings. Other child nutrition programs serve more-narrow populations. CACFP, for example, provides meals and snacks to children in early childhood and after-school settings among other venues. Programs generally provide some subsidy for all food served but a larger federal reimbursement for food served to children from low-income households. Administration: Responsibility for child nutrition programs is divided between the federal government, states, and localities. The state agency and type of local provider differs by program. In the NSLP and SBP, schools and school districts (\"school food authorities\") administer the program. Meanwhile, SFSP (and sometimes CACFP) uses a model in which sponsor organizations handle administrative responsibilities for a number of sites that serve meals. Reauthorization: The underlying laws covering the child nutrition programs were last reauthorized in the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA, P.L. 111-296, enacted December 13, 2010). This law made significant changes to child nutrition programs, including increasing federal financing for school lunches, expanding access to community eligibility and direct certification options for schools, and expanding eligibility options for home child care providers. The law also required an update to school meal nutrition guidelines as well as new guidelines for food served outside the meal programs (e.g., snacks sold in vending machines and cafeteria a la carte lines). Current Issues: The 114th Congress began but did not complete a 2016 child nutrition reauthorization, and there was no significant legislative activity with regard to reauthorization in the 115th Congress. However, the vast majority of operations and activities continue with funding provided by appropriations laws.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report about the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points.\n\nThe report explains that the federal government provides benefits to coal miners affected by black lung disease (CWP) and other lung diseases linked to coal mining when the responsible mine operators are unable to pay. These benefits are funded by the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, which gets its main revenue from an excise tax on domestically mined coal. The report discusses the history of the tax rates, the financial strain on the trust fund, and policy options to improve its fiscal outlook.\n\nFirst, the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund is used to pay benefits to miners with CWP or other lung diseases when the responsible operator can't pay. The primary revenue source is the excise tax on coal. The tax rates were $1.10 per ton for underground and $0.55 for surface, limited to 4.4% of sales price. Starting in 2019, the rates dropped to $0.50 and $0.25, limited to 2% of sales price. This reduction is expected to increase financial strain on the trust fund, which already borrows from the general fund to meet obligations.\n\nThe report also mentions that the decline in domestic coal production, recent increases in the rate of CWP, and bankruptcies in the coal sector contribute to the financial strain on the trust fund. The report provides background on the federal black lung program, including the disease and benefits, and examines the trust fund's revenues, focusing on the coal excise tax and its history. It concludes with a discussion of policy options to improve the fiscal outlook of the trust fund.\n\nThe report starts by explaining the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, which is used to finance the payment of federal Black Lung Program benefits under Part C of the Black Lung Benefits Act (BLBA) when a responsible coal operator does not meet its obligations under the law to pay benefits. The report then discusses the history of the coal excise tax, its purpose, and how it has been adjusted over time to address financial shortfalls. It also outlines various policy options, such as increasing taxes on the coal industry, reducing benefits, or restructuring the trust fund's debt.\n\nThe report provides an overview of the federal black lung program, explaining the disease and the benefits. It then examines the trust fund's revenues, focusing on the coal excise tax and its history. The report", "answers": ["The federal government pays benefits to coal miners affected by coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP, commonly referred to as black lung disease) and other lung diseases linked to coal mining in cases where responsible mine operators are not able to pay. In 2019, the monthly benefit for a miner with no dependents is $660.10. Benefits can be as much as $1,320.10 per month for miners with three or more dependents. Medical benefits are provided separately from disability benefits. Benefit payments and related administrative expenses in cases in which the responsible operators do not pay are paid out of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. The primary source of revenue for the trust fund is an excise tax on coal produced and sold domestically. If excise tax revenue is not sufficient to finance Black Lung Program benefits, the trust fund may borrow from the general fund of the Treasury. For 2018, the tax rates on coal were $1.10 per ton of underground-mined coal or $0.55 per ton of surface-mined coal, limited to 4.4% of the sales price. These rates were established in 1986. Starting in 2019, under current law, these tax rates are $0.50 per ton of underground-mined coal or $0.25 per ton of surface-mined coal, limited to 2% of the sales price. These are the rates that were set when the trust fund was established in 1977. The decline in the excise tax rates will likely put additional financial strain on a trust fund that already borrows from the general fund to meet obligations. The decline in domestic coal production, recent increases in the rate of CWP, and bankruptcies in the coal sector also contribute to the financial strain on the trust fund. The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund and associated excise tax on coal were established so that the coal industry, as opposed to taxpayers in general, would bear the burden associated with providing black lung benefits. Throughout its history, the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund has not raised revenues sufficient to meet obligations. As a result, at various points in time, Congress and the President have acted to increase the excise tax on coal, forgive or refinance trust fund debt, and modify black lung benefits eligibility. With the rate of the excise tax on coal reduced in 2019, the 116th Congress may again evaluate options for improving the fiscal condition of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, or other issues related to providing federal benefits to miners with black lung disease."], "all_classes": null, "length": 7218}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this detailed report about Puerto Rico. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points. The report is quite lengthy, so I need to identify the main sections and important information.\n\nFirst, the report starts by explaining Puerto Rico's status as a U.S. territory. It mentions that Puerto Rico has about 3.3 million residents, and that it's subject to congressional authority but has broad internal governance. Citizens can move freely to the states, and they are generally subject to the same federal laws as the states, except for certain exemptions like Medicaid. There's also a mention of federal tax exemptions for income from Puerto Rico, and the requirement to pay taxes on income from outside the territory. The report also discusses the tax treatment of corporations in Puerto Rico, including the exemption from federal taxes on profits unless they are effectively connected to a trade or business in the states. There's a part about the 2017 Public Law 115-97 that changed how dividends from foreign corporations are taxed. Then, the report moves on to discuss Puerto Rico's economy, which has been in a prolonged period of contraction. From 2005 to 2016, real GDP fell by over 9 percent, and GNP by over 11 percent. The population also declined, with a 12.8 percent drop from 2004 to 2017. The employment-to-population ratio was lower compared to the U.S., and the unemployment rate was higher. These factors have led to a small and declining labor force. The government has operated with deficits since 2002, and the deficits grew over time. The report also talks about the government's financial management, the use of debt to cover deficits, and the factors contributing to the persistent deficits. It mentions that Puerto Rico's government has been using debt to finance operations rather than cutting spending or raising taxes. The report then discusses the factors that contributed to the financial condition and levels of debt, such as the government's persistent deficits and the use of debt to cope with those deficits. The factors include inadequate financial management and oversight, policy decisions, and prolonged economic contraction. The report also covers the economic contraction, population decline, and related factors like lower employment compared to the U.S. The government's spending accounts for more than a third of the territory's GDP. The report then discusses Puerto Rico's debt levels, which have grown", "answers": ["Puerto Rico has roughly $70 billion in outstanding debt and $50 billion in unfunded pension liabilities and since August 2015 has defaulted on over $1.5 billion in debt. The effects of Hurricanes Irma and Maria will further affect Puerto Rico's ability to repay its debt, as well as its economic condition. In response to Puerto Rico's fiscal crisis, Congress passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Security Act (PROMESA) in 2016, which included a provision for GAO to review Puerto Rico's debt. This report describes the factors that contributed to Puerto Rico's financial condition and levels of debt and federal actions that could address these factors. Consistent with PROMESA, GAO focused on actions that would not increase the federal deficit. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials from the Puerto Rico and federal governments and conducted a review of relevant literature. GAO also interviewed former Puerto Rico officials and experts in Puerto Rico's economy, the municipal securities markets, and state and territorial budgeting, financial management, and debt practices, as well as officials from the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico (created by PROMESA). GAO is not making recommendations based on the federal actions identified because policymakers would need to consider challenges and tradeoffs related to implementation. The Puerto Rico government generally agreed with the factors we identified and provided additional information. GAO incorporated technical comments from SEC as appropriate. The factors that contributed to Puerto Rico's financial condition and levels of debt relate to (1) the Puerto Rico government running persistent annual deficits—where expenses exceed revenues—and (2) its use of debt to cope with deficits. Based on a literature review and interviews with current and former Puerto Rico officials, federal officials, and other relevant experts, GAO identified factors that contributed to Puerto Rico's persistent deficits: The Puerto Rico government's inadequate financial management and oversight practices. For example, the Puerto Rico government frequently overestimated the amount of revenue it would collect and Puerto Rico's agencies regularly spent more than the amounts Puerto Rico's legislature appropriated for a given fiscal year. Policy decisions by Puerto Rico's government. For example, Puerto Rico borrowed funds to balance budgets and insufficiently addressed public pension funding shortfalls. Puerto Rico's prolonged economic contraction. Examples of factors contributing to the contraction include outmigration and the resulting diminished labor force, and the high cost of importing goods and energy. Additional factors enabled Puerto Rico to use debt to finance its deficits, such as high demand for Puerto Rico debt. One cause of high demand was that under federal law, income from Puerto Rico bonds generally receives more favorable tax treatment than income from bonds issued by states and their localities. Based on an assessment of relevant literature and input from current and former Puerto Rico officials, federal officials, and other relevant experts, GAO identified three potential federal actions that may help address some of these factors. GAO also identified considerations for policymakers related to these actions. Modify the tax exempt status for Puerto Rico municipal debt. Making interest income from Puerto Rico bonds earned by investors residing outside of Puerto Rico subject to applicable state and local taxes could lower demand for Puerto Rico debt. However, reduced demand could hinder Puerto Rico's ability to borrow funds for capital investments or liquidity. Apply federal investor protection laws to Puerto Rico. Requiring Puerto Rico investment companies to disclose risks with Puerto Rico bonds and adhere to other requirements could lower demand for the bonds. However, this action could also limit Puerto Rico's ability to borrow funds. Modify the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) authority over municipal bond disclosure requirements. SEC could be allowed to require timely disclosure of materials—such as audited financial statements—associated with municipal bonds. Over the past decade, Puerto Rico often failed to provide timely audited financial statements related to its municipal bonds. Timely disclosure could help investors make informed decisions about investing in municipal bonds. However, a broad requirement could place additional burdens on all U.S. municipal issuers, such as the costs of standardizing reporting."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6356}
{"pred": " The report discusses the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and its four principal programs: Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the health-insurance marketplaces. Medicare and Medicaid are the largest and fastest-growing programs, with Medicare spending projected to reach $1.3 trillion by 2026. Medicaid is also expected to grow significantly, with program spending projected to increase by 66 percent to over $950 billion by fiscal year 2025. The use of managed-care delivery systems to provide care has also increased, with the number and percentage of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Part C growing steadily over the past several years. As of July 1, 2015, nearly two-thirds of all Medicaid beneficiaries were enrolled in managed-care plans and about 40 percent of expenditures in fiscal year 2015 were for health-care services delivered through managed care. CMS receives appropriations to carry out antifraud activities through several funds including the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control (HCFAC) program and the Medicaid Integrity Program. The HCFAC program was established under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 to coordinate federal, state, and local law-enforcement efforts to address health-care fraud and abuse and to conduct investigations and audits, among other things. In fiscal year 2016, CMS received $560 million through the HCFAC program appropriations. The Medicaid Integrity Program, established by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, supports contracts to audit and identify overpayments in Medicaid claims, and provides technical assistance for states’ program-integrity efforts. According to CMS, it received $75 million every year since fiscal year 2009 through the Medicaid Integrity Program appropriations. In fiscal year 2016, total program-integrity obligations to address fraud, waste, and abuse for Medicare and Medicaid were $1.45 billion. The report highlights the significant risks of fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicare and Medicaid due to their size, scope, and complexity. It also discusses the challenges associated with improper payments in these programs, including the difficulty of measuring the extent of deterred fraud, isolating potential fraud from legitimate activity or other forms of improper payments, and determining the amount of undetected fraud. The report also discusses the importance of antifraud training for employees, as it can help to create a culture of integrity and compliance within the agency. The report concludes", "answers": ["CMS, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), provides health coverage for over 145 million Americans through its four principal programs, with annual outlays of about $1.1 trillion. GAO has designated the two largest programs, Medicare and Medicaid, as high risk partly due to their vulnerability to fraud, waste, and abuse. In fiscal year 2016, improper payment estimates for these programs totaled about $95 billion. GAO's Fraud Risk Framework and the subsequent enactment of the Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015 have called attention to the importance of federal agencies' antifraud efforts. This report examines (1) CMS's approach for managing fraud risks across its four principal programs, and (2) how CMS's efforts managing fraud risks in Medicare and Medicaid align with the Fraud Risk Framework. GAO reviewed laws and regulations and HHS and CMS documents, such as program-integrity manuals. It also interviewed CMS officials and a sample of CMS stakeholders, including state officials and contractors. GAO selected states based on fraud risk and other factors, such as geographic diversity. GAO selected contractors based on a mix of companies and geographic areas served. The approach that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has taken for managing fraud risks across its four principal programs—Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the health-insurance marketplaces—is incorporated into its broader program-integrity approach. According to CMS officials, this broader program-integrity approach can help the agency develop control activities to address multiple sources of improper payments, including fraud. As the figure below shows, CMS views fraud as part of a spectrum of actions that may result in improper payments. CMS's efforts managing fraud risks in Medicare and Medicaid partially align with GAO's 2015 A Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs (Fraud Risk Framework). This framework describes leading practices in four components: commit , assess , design and implement , and evaluate and adapt . CMS has shown commitment to combating fraud in part by establishing a dedicated entity—the Center for Program Integrity—to lead antifraud efforts. Furthermore, CMS is offering and requiring antifraud training for stakeholder groups such as providers, beneficiaries, and health-insurance plans. However, CMS does not require fraud-awareness training on a regular basis for employees, a practice that the framework identifies as a way agencies can help create a culture of integrity and compliance. Regarding the assess and design and implement components, CMS has taken steps to identify fraud risks, such as by designating specific provider types as high risk and developing associated control activities. However, it has not conducted a fraud risk assessment for Medicare or Medicaid, and has not designed and implemented a risk-based antifraud strategy. A fraud risk assessment allows managers to fully consider fraud risks to their programs, analyze their likelihood and impact, and prioritize risks. Managers can then design and implement a strategy with specific control activities to mitigate these fraud risks, as well as an appropriate evaluation approach consistent with the evaluate and adapt component. By developing a fraud risk assessment and using that assessment to create an antifraud strategy and evaluation approach, CMS could better ensure that it is addressing the full portfolio of risks and strategically targeting the most-significant fraud risks facing Medicare and Medicaid. GAO recommends that CMS (1) provide and require fraud-awareness training to its employees, (2) conduct fraud risk assessments, and (3) create an antifraud strategy for Medicare and Medicaid, including an approach for evaluation.

{"pred": " The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) launched the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program in 2011 to convert public housing units into other rental assistance programs, such as Section 8 rental assistance. The program has two main components: the first allows public housing authorities (PHAs) to convert units from public housing to properties with long-term project-based voucher (PBV) or project-based rental assistance (PBRA) contracts. These contracts tie the assistance to the unit to provide subsidized housing to low-income residents. The second component of RAD converts privately owned properties with expiring subsidies under old rental assistance programs to PBV or PBRA in order to preserve affordability and encourage property rehabilitation. The goals of the RAD program include preserving the affordability of federally assisted rental properties and improving their physical and financial condition. Specifically, postconversion owners (PHAs, nonprofits, or for-profit entities) can leverage the subsidy payments under newly converted contracts to raise capital through private debt and equity investments, or conventional private debt, to make improvements. The RAD program provides added flexibility for PHAs to access private and public funding sources to supplement public housing funding. These financing sources may include debt financing through public or private lenders; mortgage financing insured by FHA; PHA operating reserves; replacement housing factor funds; seller or take-back financing; deferred developer fees; equity investment generated by the availability of 4 percent and 9 percent LIHTC; or other private or philanthropic sources. PHAs also may pursue various options for their conversions, which often depend on property needs and available financing, including property rehabilitation or new construction. Additionally, PHAs may undertake conversion involving no property rehabilitation or new construction to meet certain financial goals or for future rehabilitation or new construction, as long as the PHA can demonstrate to HUD that the property does not need immediate rehabilitation and can be physically and financially maintained for the term of the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payment contract (HAP contract). The RAD program has been implemented and expanded in phases. Since its authorization, the RAD unit cap gradually increased from 60,000 units in 2011 to 225,000 units in May 2017. The RAD unit cap is currently fully subscribed with all 225,000 units allocated. As of September 30, 2017, 689 conversions were closed that involved a total of 74,709 units (see fig. 1 for a", "answers": ["HUD administers the Public Housing program, which provides federally assisted rental units to low-income households through PHAs. In 2010, HUD estimated its aging public housing stock had $25.6 billion in unmet capital needs. To help address these needs, the RAD program was authorized in fiscal year 2012. RAD allows PHAs to move (convert) properties in the public housing program to Section 8 rental assistance programs, and retain property ownership or transfer it to other entities. The conversion enables PHAs to access additional funding, including investor equity, generally not available for public housing properties. GAO was asked to review public housing conversions under RAD and any impact on residents. This report addresses, among other objectives, HUD's (1) assessment of conversion outcomes; (2) oversight of resident safeguards; and (3) provisions to help preserve the long-term affordability of units. GAO analyzed data on RAD conversions through fiscal year 2017; reviewed a sample of randomly selected, nongeneralizable RAD property files; and interviewed HUD officials, PHAs, developers, academics, and affected residents. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) put procedures in place to evaluate and monitor the impact of conversion of public housing properties under the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program. RAD's authorizing legislation requires HUD to assess and publish findings about the amount of private-sector leveraging. HUD uses a variety of metrics to measure conversion outcomes. But, the metric HUD uses to measure private-sector leveraging—the share of private versus public funding for construction or rehabilitation of assisted housing—has limitations. For example, HUD's leveraging ratio counts some public resources as leveraged private-sector investment and does not use final (post-completion) data. As a result, HUD's ability to accurately assess private-sector leveraging is limited. HUD does not systematically use its data systems to track effects of RAD conversions on resident households (such as changes in rent and income, or relocation) or monitor use of all resident safeguards. Rather, since 2016, HUD has required public housing agencies (PHA) or other post-conversion owners to maintain resident logs and collect such information. But the resident logs do not contain historical program information. HUD has not developed a process for systematically reviewing information from its data systems and resident logs on an ongoing basis. HUD has been developing procedures to monitor compliance with some resident safeguards—such as the right to return to a converted property—and begun a limited review of compliance with these safeguards. However, HUD has not yet developed a process for monitoring other safeguards—such as access to other housing voucher options. Federal internal control standards require agencies to use quality information to achieve objectives, and obtain and evaluate relevant and reliable data in a timely manner for use in effective monitoring. Without a comprehensive review of household information and procedures for fully monitoring all resident safeguards, HUD cannot fully assess the effects of RAD on residents. RAD authorizing legislation and the program's use agreements (contracts with property owners) contain provisions intended to help ensure the long-term availability of affordable units, but the provisions have not been tested in situations such as foreclosure. For example, use agreements between HUD and property owners specify affordability and use restrictions that according to the contract would survive a default or foreclosure. HUD officials stated that HUD intends to develop procedures to identify and respond to risks to long-term affordability, including default or foreclosure in RAD properties. However, HUD has not yet done so. According to federal internal control standards, agencies should identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving goals and objectives. Procedures that address oversight of affordability requirements would better position HUD to help ensure RAD conversions comply with program requirements, detect potential foreclosure and other risks, and take corrective actions. GAO makes five recommendations to HUD intended to improve leveraging metrics, monitoring of the use and enforcement of resident safeguards, and compliance with RAD requirements. HUD agreed with our recommendations to improve metrics and build on existing oversight."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12616}

The report is about how federal agencies acquire heavy equipment, including the number, types, costs, and the methods they use (purchase vs. lease). It also discusses the documentation of lease-versus-purchase analyses and how agencies manage the utilization of their heavy equipment.\n\nFirst, the report mentions that agencies generally acquire heavy equipment from commercial vendors or through the GSA, which contracts with vendors. They can purchase or lease the equipment. The term \"lease\" is used for both long-term and short-term, but the agencies have different definitions. For example, the Air Force defines rentals as less than 120 days, while FWS and NPS use it for a year or less. The report uses \"rental\" for short-term and \"long-term lease\" for leases not considered rentals by the agency.\n\nThen, the report talks about the GSA's Short-Term Rental program, which started in 2013. This program allows agencies to request short-term rentals (less than a year) of heavy equipment from GSA, which then works with commercial vendors to provide the equipment. The purpose is to eliminate ownership and maintenance costs for infrequently used heavy equipment. However, there are no central reporting requirements for agencies' inventories of heavy equipment. Each agency is required to maintain inventory controls for its property, which includes heavy equipment. Agencies maintain inventory data through agency-specific databases, and each agency can set its own requirements for what data are required and how these data are maintained. For example, an agency may choose to maintain data in a headquarters database, or it could choose to maintain data at the local level. The report also mentions that some agencies track utilization data, like hours used, while others don't have such data or require specific levels.\n\nThe report then provides data on the heavy equipment owned by 20 agencies, including the number, types, acquisition years, and locations as of June 2017. The total number of heavy equipment items is over 136,000, with the Department of Defense owning the majority (over 100,000 items, about 74 percent). The Department of Agriculture owns the second highest number (almost 9,000 items, about 6 percent).

GAO collected heavy equipment inventory data as of June 2017 from the 24 agencies that have chief financial officers responsible for overseeing financial management. GAO also selected three agencies (using factors such as the heavy equipment fleet's size) and reviewed their acquisitions of and guidance on heavy equipment. These agencies' practices are not generalizable to all acquisitions but provide insight into what efforts these agencies take to acquire thousands of heavy equipment items. GAO also interviewed officials at the three selected agencies. Of the 24 agencies GAO reviewed, 20 reported owning over 136,000 heavy equipment items such as cranes, backhoes, and forklifts, and spending over $7.4 billion (in 2016 dollars) to acquire this equipment. The remaining 4 agencies reported that they do not own any heavy equipment. The three selected agencies GAO reviewed in-depth—the Air Force within the Department of Defense (DOD), and the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service within the Department of the Interior (Interior)—spent about $360 million to purchase about 3,500 heavy equipment assets in calendar years 2012 through 2016 and over $5 million to lease heavy equipment from fiscal years 2012 through 2016. Officials from all three agencies stated that they consider mission needs and the availability of equipment leases when deciding whether to lease or purchase heavy equipment. Federal regulations provide that agencies should consider whether it is more economical to lease or purchase equipment when acquiring heavy equipment, and federal internal control standards require that management clearly document all transactions in a manner that allows the documentation to be readily available for examination. However, in reviewing selected leases and purchases of heavy equipment from these three agencies, GAO found that officials did not consistently conduct or document lease-versus-purchase analyses. Officials at the Air Force and Interior said that there was a lack of clarity in agency policies about when they were required to conduct and document such analyses. Without greater clarity on when lease-versus-purchase analyses should be conducted and documented, these agencies may not be spending funds on heavy equipment effectively. The Department of the Interior and the Air Force should clarify the circumstances in which lease-versus-purchases analyses for heavy equipment acquisitions are to be conducted and documented. The Departments of the Interior and Defense concurred with these recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6750}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. \n\nThe report is about the Department of Defense (DOD) workforce changes since 2001. It mentions that the total workforce, including military, civilian, and contractor personnel, peaked around 2011 and has since decreased. The reasons for this change include varying levels of U.S. involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan, military to civilian conversions, contractor insourcing, and the growth in certain workforces like acquisition and cyber.\n\nThe report also discusses the legal framework governing DOD's workforce management, including sections 129, 129a, and 2463 of Title 10 of the United States Code. These sections outline the policies for managing the workforce, including the use of civilian employees for new functions and the cost comparison to determine the most cost-efficient mix of military, civilian, and contracted services.\n\nDOD Instruction 1100.22 is mentioned, which provides policy and procedures for determining the appropriate workforce mix. It includes criteria for workforce-mix decisions and directs DOD components to conduct cost comparisons for new or expanding mission requirements and functions that could be performed by civilian employees.\n\nThe report then goes into detail about the DOD's Cost-Comparison Report, which addressed three elements and partially addressed one element concerning the accounting for the fully-burdened, or full, cost of federal civilian and service contractor personnel performing functions at the selected installations. The report also mentions that DOD officials believe the methodology is in line with DODI 7041.04, but they didn't include non-labor costs in their calculations, which the report says is a problem.\n\nThe report also mentions that DOD officials believe their methodology is in line with DODI 7041.04, but they didn't include non-labor costs in their calculations, which the report says is a problem. The report states that DODI 7041.04 mandates that the full cost of personnel should include direct and indirect non-labor costs, such as those mentioned earlier. However, DOD officials stated that they considered including non-labor costs in their calculations but did not because they believed these costs would add approximately the same to both federal civilian and service contractor costs. \n\nThe report also discusses the methodology used in the Cost-Comparison Report, which included identifying labor", "answers": ["In addition to more than 2.2 million active duty and reserve personnel, DOD employs about 760,000 federal civilians and more than 560,000 contractors. In the Senate Report 114-49 accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 included a provision for DOD to issue a report (1) assessing functions performed by federal civilian and service contractor personnel, (2) accounting for the full costs of federal civilian and service contractor personnel performing these functions, (3) comparing these costs, and (4) assessing available hiring and retention authorities for federal civilians. The Senate report also included a provision for GAO to assess DOD's report, which DOD submitted to Congress in April 2017. This report examines the extent to which DOD's report addressed the prescribed congressional elements. GAO reviewed DOD's report and compared it to the prescribed elements, examined documents relevant to DOD's cost estimating and comparison methodology, and interviewed DOD officials, including those in its Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation responsible for the calculations in DOD's report. In response to Congressional direction, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a report in April 2017 comparing the costs of federal civilian and service contractor personnel at select installations. The report addressed three out of four provision elements and partially addressed one, as discussed below. DOD concluded that neither federal civilians nor service contractors were predominately more or less expensive, with costs being dependent on position, location, and level of seniority. DOD noted that it used a non-probability based sample of personnel for its report, and the results are not generalizable. An assessment of performance of functions being performed by federal civilian and service contractor personnel at six military installations, with four being in the continental United States and two being outside the continental United States. GAO believes that DOD addressed this requirement because it developed a methodology to assess performance of functions performed by federal civilians and service contractors at 17 organizations within nine geographic regions including two locations outside the continental United States. DOD used data from the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System to identify military installations with large reported numbers of federal civilians. DOD determined that personnel need to perform at least 80 percent common tasks to be able to make a comparison. An accounting of the fully-burdened, or full, cost of federal civilian and service contractor personnel performing functions at the selected installations including training, benefits, reimbursable costs, and facility overhead. GAO believes that DOD partially addressed this requirement because while it calculated the labor costs of selected federal civilian and service contractor full-time equivalents performing similar functions for organizations at government-owned facilities, it excluded certain non-labor costs from its calculations. A comparison of the costs of performance of these functions by federal civilians and service contractor personnel at the selected installations. GAO believes that DOD addressed this requirement because it compared calculated costs for selected federal civilians and service contractors performing similar functions at selected installations and included those comparisons in its report. An assessment of the flexible employment authorities for the employment and retention of federal civilian employees. GAO believes that DOD addressed this requirement because it sent questionnaires to DOD hiring officials and human resource professionals to collect information on flexible employment authorities and conducted interviews with these and human resource professionals at the same 17 organizations used for the cost comparison. Based on an analysis of the information collected, DOD's report included several conclusions regarding flexible hiring authorities and made one recommendation. GAO is not making any recommendations; however, DOD non-concurred with GAO's assessment that DOD partially addressed the element to account for the full cost of personnel. GAO believes the assessment is correct as discussed in the report."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4582}
{"pred": " The report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) evaluates the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)’s major acquisition programs, focusing on their adherence to schedule and cost goals, as well as the effectiveness of policies and processes in managing these programs. The report outlines the Department’s acquisition management policies, which include the establishment of a Joint Requirements Council (JRC) to develop and lead a component-driven joint requirements process. The JRC is responsible for validating proposed capability needs and operational requirements, ensuring that programs are aligned with the department’s strategic functions. The report also discusses the Department’s requirements development process, which moves from broad mission needs to operational requirements, ensuring that systems meet the necessary performance parameters. Additionally, the report highlights the Department’s testing and evaluation policies, which are designed to provide timely information to managers and stakeholders, reducing risks and improving program outcomes. The report includes an assessment of 28 major acquisition programs, finding that 10 were on track to meet their schedule and cost goals during 2017, while 14 were not. The programs not on track experienced significant schedule and cost changes, the latter of which was not known. The report also highlights the need for more timely cost estimates to better manage the department’s acquisition portfolio, which is currently not affordable over the next five years. The report concludes that while DHS has made progress in strengthening its policies and processes for acquisition management, there are still opportunities to further strengthen the department’s portfolio management practices. The report recommends that the Under Secretary for Management update the department’s acquisition management policy to ensure that major programs are managed effectively, and that the Office of Program Accountability and Risk Management (PARM) assess the results of major programs to improve performance across the department’s portfolio. The report also highlights the need for the Department to report program-level operations and support costs to Congress, which would improve oversight and ensure that the department’s acquisition programs are affordable and manageable. The report concludes that DHS has established policies and processes for managing its major acquisition programs, but the performance of these programs is not meeting the department’s goals, which are to ensure the safety of the American people and the security of the nation’s homeland. The report recommends that the Under Secretary for Management update the department’s acquisition management policy to ensure that major acquisition programs are managed effectively, and that the Office of Program Accountability and Risk Management (PARM) assess the results of major acquisition programs to improve performance across the department’s portfolio.

DHS's acquisition activities are on GAO's High Risk List, in part, because of management and funding issues. The Explanatory Statement accompanying the DHS Appropriations Act, 2015 included a provision for GAO to review DHS's major acquisitions. This report, GAO's fourth annual review, assesses the extent to which: (1) DHS's major acquisition programs are on track to meet their schedule and cost goals, and (2) DHS has taken actions to enhance its policies and processes to better reflect key practices for effectively managing a portfolio of investments. GAO reviewed 28 acquisition programs, including DHS's largest programs that were in the process of obtaining new capabilities as of April 2017, and programs GAO or DHS identified as at risk of poor outcomes. GAO assessed cost and schedule progress against baselines, assessed DHS's policies and processes against GAO's key portfolio management practices, and met with relevant DHS officials. During 2017, 10 of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) programs GAO assessed that had approved schedule and cost goals were on track to meet those goals. GAO reviewed 28 programs in total, 4 of which were new programs that GAO did not assess because they did not establish cost and schedule goals before the end of calendar year 2017 as planned. The table shows the status of the 24 programs GAO assessed. Reasons for schedule delays or cost increases included technical challenges, changes in requirements, and external factors. Recent enhancements to DHS's acquisition management, resource allocation, and requirements policies largely reflect key portfolio management practices (see table). However, DHS is in the early stages of implementing these policies. GAO identified two areas where DHS could strengthen its portfolio management policies and implementation efforts: DHS's policies do not reflect the key practice to reassess a program that breaches—or exceeds—its cost, schedule, or performance goals in the context of the portfolio to ensure it is still relevant or affordable. Acquisition management officials said that, in practice, they do so based on a certification of funds memorandum—a tool GAO has found to be effective for DHS leadership to assess program affordability—submitted by the component when one of its programs re-baselines in response to a breach. Documenting this practice in policy would help ensure DHS makes strategic investment decisions within its limited budget. DHS is not leveraging information gathered from reviews once programs complete implementation to manage its portfolio of active acquisition programs. DHS's acquisition policy requires programs to conduct post-implementation reviews after initial capabilities are deployed, which is in line with GAO's key practices. Acquisition management officials said they do not consider the results of these reviews in managing DHS's portfolio because the reviews are typically conducted after oversight for a program shifts to the components. Leveraging these results across DHS could enable DHS to address potential issues that may contribute to poor outcomes, such as schedule slips and cost growth, for other programs in its acquisition portfolio. GAO recommends DHS update its acquisition policy to require certification of fund memorandums when programs re-baseline as a result of a breach and assess programs' post-implementation reviews to improve performance across the acquisition portfolio. DHS concurred with GAO's recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 30427}
{"pred": " The report discusses the Department of Defense's (DOD) efforts to rebuild military readiness, particularly in the Navy and Marine Corps. Following four significant mishaps in 2017 that resulted in the loss of 17 sailors' lives and serious damage to Navy ships, the Navy identified several challenges, including the degraded condition and expired training certifications of ships homeported overseas, reductions to ship crews that contributed to sailor overwork and safety risks, and an inability to complete maintenance on time. Since that time, the Navy has completed two internal reviews to address these and other challenges, identifying 111 recommendations to improve surface fleet readiness. The Navy formed an executive group to guide and closely track the implementation of recommendations, and its reform efforts are ongoing. As of November 2018, the Navy reported that it had implemented 78 (i.e., 70 percent) of these recommendations. Navy officials recognize that full implementation will take significant time and management attention to address the fundamental readiness challenges identified. The report also highlights that the Navy has made progress in addressing some of the challenges, such as improving the percentage of cruisers and destroyers with lapsed certifications in Japan, from 41 percent in September 2017 to 9 percent as of November 2018. However, the Navy continues to struggle with rebuilding the readiness of the existing fleet due to enduring maintenance and manning challenges. As the Navy seeks to expand its fleet by 25 percent, these challenges will likely be further exacerbated and the Navy will likely face additional affordability challenges. The report also discusses the Navy's efforts to improve training standards and ensure that crews are certified before deployment. The Navy has implemented controls to limit waivers that allowed training lapses to worsen, now requiring multiple high-level approvals for ships to operate uncertified. The report also highlights that the Navy has made progress in improving the percentage of cruisers and destroyers with lapsed certifications in Japan, from 41 percent in September 2017 to 9 percent as of November 2018, with less than 3 percent of certifications expired on ships in operational status. While the Navy has demonstrated its commitment to ensuring that crews are certified prior to deploying, training for amphibious operations and higher-level collective training may not be fully implemented for several years. The report also discusses the Navy's ongoing efforts to address maintenance delays, which have been a persistent issue affecting the fleet's readiness. The report highlights that the Navy has been unable to complete ship", "answers": ["The 2018 National Defense Strategy emphasizes that restoring and retaining readiness is critical to success in the emerging security environment. The Navy and Marine Corps are working to rebuild the readiness of their forces while growing and modernizing their aging fleet of ships and aircraft. However, achieving readiness recovery goals will take years as both services continue to be challenged to rebuild readiness amid continued operational demands. This statement provides information on current and future readiness challenges facing (1) the Navy ship and submarine fleet and (2) Navy and Marine Corps aviation. GAO also discusses prior recommendations on Navy and Marine Corps readiness and progress to address them. This statement is based on previously published work since 2015 related to Navy and Marine Corps readiness challenges, including shipyard workforce and capital investment, ship crewing, weapon system sustainment, the fighter pilot workforce, and modernizing force structure. GAO conducted site visits to the Pacific fleet in November 2018 and analyzed updated data, as appropriate. The Navy has taken steps to address training shortfalls in the surface fleet, but faces persistent maintenance and personnel challenges as it seeks to rebuild ship and submarine readiness. While the Navy has corrective actions underway, they will take years to implement. Following ship collisions in 2017, the Navy has taken steps to ensure its crews are trained to standards prior to deployment and made significant progress in those efforts. However, the Navy has struggled to complete ship maintenance—with only 30 percent of maintenance completed on time since fiscal year 2012—leading to thousands of days that ships were unavailable for training and operations (see figure). Additionally, manning shortfalls and experience gaps continue to contribute to high sailor workload and are likely to continue through at least fiscal year 2021. The Navy has developed a plan to improve shipyards and is re-examining its ship manning, among other actions; however, these positive steps have not yet fully addressed GAO's recommendations. Looking to the future, the Navy has indicated that it wants to grow its fleet to meet demands. However, the costs of such growth are not yet known and would likely require resourcing well above currently planned levels. Navy and Marine Corps aircraft availability has been limited due to numerous challenges (see figure). Specifically, the seven aircraft GAO reviewed have generally experienced decreasing availability since fiscal year 2011 and did not meet availability goals in fiscal years 2017 and 2018. The F-35—the future of naval aviation—also has not met availability goals due to part shortages and poor sustainment planning. In September 2018, the Department of Defense established aggressive targets for aircraft availability. While the Navy and Marine Corps are taking actions to improve aircraft availability, including addressing GAO's recommendations, aviation readiness will take many years to recover. GAO has made a total of 45 recommendations in the prior work described in this statement. The Department of Defense concurred with most of them, and has many actions underway, but has not yet fully implemented any.

{"pred": " (One page, 500 words)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points.\n\nThe report explains that FHA is part of HUD and provides insurance to private lenders against borrower defaults. If a borrower defaults, FHA pays the lender the remaining amount. This protects the lender, not the borrower. The report also mentions that FHA is one of three agencies providing mortgage insurance, along with VA and USDA. FHA is the most broadly targeted, not limited by factors like veteran status, income, or rural areas. However, other factors like maximum mortgage amount, insurance fees, and eligibility standards can affect availability or attractiveness of FHA loans.\n\nThe report gives background on FHA's history, created in 1934 during the Great Depression. Before FHA, mortgages were short-term, with high default rates. FHA introduced 20-year mortgages with full repayment, insuring lenders. This helped stabilize the mortgage market and stimulate the economy. Over time, 15- and 30-year mortgages became standard. FHA became part of HUD in 1965.\n\nThe report discusses the role of FHA in the mortgage market, acting as a countercyclical force. When the economy is weak and mortgage credit is tight, FHA insures more mortgages. When the economy is strong, fewer mortgages are insured. This helps during downturns by providing access to mortgages when others are not available.\n\nFHA-insured mortgages are intended to help borrowers with lower credit scores, smaller down payments, or other characteristics that make them risky. These loans have lower down payment requirements than conventional mortgages. The FHA also has less stringent credit history requirements than many conventional loans. This makes FHA-insured mortgages attractive to borrowers without traditional credit histories or with weaker credit histories.\n\nThe report also mentions that FHA-insured mortgages play a significant role for first-time homebuyers, low- and moderate-income households, and minorities. For example, 83% of FHA-insured mortgages made to purchase a home in FY2018 were obtained by first-time homebuyers. Over one-third of all FHA loans were obtained by minority households.\n\nThe report provides data on the number and dollar volume of mortgages FHA insures, along with data on FHA's market share in recent years. It also mentions that the financial status of the FHA mortgage insurance fund is not detailed here, and refers to another report for more information.\n\nThe report explains that", "answers": ["The Federal Housing Administration (FHA), an agency of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), was created by the National Housing Act of 1934. FHA insures private lenders against the possibility of borrowers defaulting on mortgages that meet certain criteria, thereby expanding the availability of mortgage credit beyond what may be available otherwise. If the borrower defaults on the mortgage, FHA is to repay the lender the remaining amount owed. A household that obtains an FHA-insured mortgage must meet FHA's eligibility and underwriting standards, including showing that it has sufficient income to repay a mortgage. FHA requires a minimum down payment of 3.5% from most borrowers, which is lower than the down payment required for many other types of mortgages. FHA-insured mortgages cannot exceed a statutory maximum mortgage amount, which varies by area and is based on area median house prices but cannot exceed a specified ceiling in high-cost areas. (The ceiling is set at $726,525 in high-cost areas in calendar year 2019.) Borrowers are charged fees, called mortgage insurance premiums, in exchange for the insurance. In FY2018, FHA insured over 1 million new mortgages (including both home purchase and refinance mortgages) with a combined principal balance of $209 billion. FHA's share of the mortgage market tends to vary with economic conditions and other factors. In the aftermath of the housing market turmoil that began around 2007 and a related contraction of mortgage lending, FHA insured a larger share of mortgages than it had in the preceding years. Its overall share of the mortgage market increased from about 3% in calendar year 2005 to a peak of 21% in 2009. Since that time, FHA's share of the mortgage market has decreased somewhat, though it remains higher than it was in the early 2000s. In calendar year 2017, FHA's overall share of the mortgage market was about 17%. FHA-insured mortgages, like all mortgages, experienced increased default rates during the housing downturn that began around 2007, leading to concerns about the stability of the FHA insurance fund for single-family mortgages, the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund). In response to these concerns, FHA adopted a number of policy changes in an attempt to limit risk to the MMI Fund. These changes have included raising the fees that it charges and making changes to certain eligibility criteria for FHA-insured loans."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5182}

The Navy's FY2019 budget requested $2.3 billion for the CVN-78 program, which is the first of the Ford-class carriers. The program has faced significant cost growth, with the Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) costing $13.027 billion in then-year dollars, a figure that is $1.3 billion more than the original cost cap. The Navy's FY2020 budget submission proposed to not fund the mid-life nuclear refueling overhaul (RCOH) for the aircraft carrier CVN-75 (Harry S. Truman), and to instead retire the ship around FY2024 and deactivate one of the Navy's carrier air wings at about the same time. However, the Administration withdrew this proposal and now supports funding the RCOH and keeping the ship in service past FY2024. The report also discusses the Navy's 11-carrier force structure, the 3-year centers for carrier procurement, and the potential cost savings from a two-carrier block buy contract. It also discusses the potential for shifting to smaller carriers in the future, the impact of the Navy's decision to delay the RCOH for the Ford-class carrier, and the potential for cost savings from a two-carrier block buy contract.

Ford (CVN-78) class of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers (CVNs). CVN-78 (Gerald R. Ford) was procured in FY2008. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget estimates the ship's procurement cost at $13,084.0 million (i.e., about $13.1 billion) in then-year dollars. The ship received advance procurement (AP) funding in FY2001-FY2007 and was fully funded in FY2008-FY2011 using congressionally authorized four-year incremental funding. To help cover cost growth on the ship, the ship received an additional $1,394.9 million in FY2014-FY2016 and FY2018 cost-to-complete procurement funding. The ship was delivered to the Navy on May 31, 2017, and was commissioned into service on July 22, 2017. The Navy is currently working to complete construction, testing, and certification of the ship's 11 weapons elevators. CVN-79 (John F. Kennedy) was procured in FY2013. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget estimates the ship's procurement cost at $11,327.4 million (i.e., about $11.3 billion) in then-year dollars. The ship received AP funding in FY2007-FY2012, and was fully funded in FY2013-FY2018 using congressionally authorized six-year incremental funding. The ship is scheduled for delivery to the Navy in September 2024. CVN-80 (Enterprise) and CVN-81 (not yet named) are being procured under a two-ship block buy contract that was authorized by Section 121(a)(2) of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (H.R. 5515/P.L. 115-232 of August 13, 2018). The provision permitted the Navy to add CVN-81 to the existing contract for building CVN-80 after the Department of Defense (DOD) made certain certifications to Congress. DOD made the certifications on December 31, 2018, and the Navy announced the award of the contract on January 31, 2019. Compared to the estimated procurement costs for CVN-80 and CVN-81 in the Navy's FY2019 budget submission, the Navy estimates under its FY2020 budget submission that the two-ship block buy contract will reduce the cost of CVN-80 by $246.6 million and the cost of CVN-81 by $2,637.3 million, for a combined reduction of $2,883.9 million (i.e., about $2.9 billion). Using higher estimated baseline costs for CVN-80 and CVN-81 taken from a December 2017 Navy business case analysis, the Navy estimates under its FY2020 budget submission that the two-ship contract will reduce the cost of CVN-80 by $770.9 million and the cost of CVN-81 by $3,086.3 million, for a combined reduction of $3,857.2 million (i.e., about $3.9 billion). CVN-80 was procured in FY2018. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget estimates the ship's procurement cost at $12,335.1 million (i.e., about $12.3 billion) in then-year dollars.

The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests $1,062.0 million in procurement funding for the ship. The ship is scheduled for delivery to the Navy in March 2028. Prior to the awarding of the two-ship block buy contract, CVN-81 was scheduled to be procured in FY2023. Following the awarding of the two-ship block buy contract, the Navy has chosen to show CVN-81 in its FY2020 budget submission as a ship to be procured in FY2020 (as opposed to a ship that was procured in FY2019). The Navy's FY2020 budget submission estimates the ship's procurement cost at $12,450.7 million (i.e., about $12.5 billion) in then-year dollars. The Navy plans to fully fund the ship beginning in FY2019 and extending beyond FY2026 using incremental funding authorized by Section 121(c) of P.L. 115-232. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests $1,285.0 million in procurement funding for the ship. The ship is scheduled for delivery to the Navy in February 2032. The Navy's FY2020 budget submission proposed to not fund the mid-life nuclear refueling overhaul (called a Refueling Complex Overhaul, or RCOH) for the aircraft carrier CVN-75 (Harry S. Truman), and to instead retire the ship around FY2024 and also deactivate one of the Navy's carrier air wings at about the same time. On April 30, 2019, however, the Administration announced that it was effectively withdrawing this proposal from the Navy's FY2020 budget submission. The Administration now supports funding the CVN-75 RCOH and keeping CVN-75 (and by implication its associated air wing) in service past FY2024. Oversight issues for Congress for the CVN-78 program include the following: DOD's decision to show CVN-81 in its FY2020 budget submission as a ship to be procured in FY2020, instead of a ship that was procured in FY2019; the Navy's decision, as part of its FY2020 budget submission, to not accelerate the scheduled procurement of CVN-82 from FY2028 to an earlier fiscal year; whether to approve, reject, or modify the Navy's FY2020 procurement funding request for the CVN-78 program; the date for achieving the Navy's 12-ship force-level goal for aircraft carriers; cost growth in the CVN-78 program, Navy efforts to stem that growth, and Navy efforts to manage costs so as to stay within the program's cost caps; Navy efforts to complete the construction, testing, and certification of the weapons elevators on CVN-78; additional CVN-78 program issues that were raised in a December 2018 report from the Department of Defense's (DOD's) Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E); additional CVN-78 program issues that were raised in a May 2019 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on DOD weapon systems; whether the Navy should shift at some point from procuring large-deck, nuclear-powered carriers like the CVN-78 class to procuring smaller aircraft carriers."], "all_classes": null, "length": 32726}

The report is about risk management for federal facilities, specifically how agencies use assessment methodologies that align with the Interagency Security Committee (ISC) standards. \n\nThe ISC was established in 1995 after the Oklahoma City bombing. Their main goal is to enhance the security of federal facilities by developing and evaluating security standards, ensuring compliance, and overseeing the implementation of appropriate security measures. The report mentions that the ISC Standard requires agencies to follow a risk management process when conducting risk assessments for each of their facilities. This process includes determining the facility's security level, ranging from level I (lowest risk) for facilities with 100 or fewer employees to level V (highest risk) for the most critical facilities with over 750 employees. The security level determines the baseline countermeasures. \n\nThe report then discusses the four agencies: CBP, FAA, ARS, and the Forest Service. It found that none of the agencies' methodologies fully aligned with the ISC Standard. The ISC gives agencies some flexibility to design their own security-assessment methodologies as long as they adhere to fundamental principles of a sound risk-management methodology. Specifically, methodologies must consider all of the undesirable events identified in the ISC Standard as possible risks to federal facilities and assess three factors of risk (threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences) for each of the events. \n\nThe report also highlights that the agencies faced challenges in conducting physical security assessments and monitoring the results. For example, some agencies had backlogs of assessments due to insufficient staff or competing priorities. The report found that agencies did not always adhere to the principles of risk management, such as assessing all three factors for each undesirable event. \n\nAdditionally, the report discusses the need for agencies to balance their physical security needs with other operational priorities. It mentions that the Office of Management and Budget and the agency have developed more comprehensive leading practices in capital decision-making that provide agencies with guidance for prioritizing budget decisions such as for countermeasure projects. \n\nThe report also found that agencies were not collecting the necessary information to monitor their security programs. For example, agencies were not tracking the status of countermeasures across their entire portfolio. This lack of information made it difficult for agencies to make informed resource allocation decisions. \n\nThe report concludes that the agencies need to improve their methodologies to better align with the ISC Standard. This includes considering all 33 undesirable events, assessing the", "answers": ["Protecting federal employees and facilities from security threats is of critical importance. Most federal agencies are generally responsible for their facilities and have physical security programs to do so. GAO was asked to examine how federal agencies assess facilities' security risks. This report examines: (1) how selected agencies' assessment methodologies align with the ISC's risk management standard for identifying necessary countermeasures and (2) what management challenges, if any, selected agencies reported facing in conducting physical security assessments and monitoring the results. GAO selected four agencies—CBP, FAA, ARS, and the Forest Service—based on their large number of facilities and compared each agency's assessment methodology to the ISC Standard; analyzed facility assessment schedules and results from 2010 through 2016; and interviewed security officials. GAO also visited 13 facilities from these four agencies, selected based on geographical dispersion and their high risk level. None of the four agencies GAO reviewed—U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), and the Forest Service—used security assessment methodologies that fully aligned with the Interagency Security Committee's Risk Management Process for Federal Facilities standard (the ISC Standard). This standard requires that methodologies used to identify necessary facility countermeasures—such as fences and closed-circuit televisions—must: 1. Consider all of the undesirable events (i.e., arson and vandalism) identified by the ISC Standard as possible risks to facilities. 2. Assess three factors—threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences—for each of these events and use these three factors to measure risk. All four agencies used methodologies that included some ISC requirements when conducting assessments. CBP and FAA assessed vulnerabilities but not threats and consequences. ARS and the Forest Service assessed threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences, but did not use these factors to measure risk. In addition, the agencies considered many, but not all 33 undesirable events related to physical security as possible risks to their facilities. Agencies are taking steps to improve their methodologies. For example, ARS and the Forest Service now use a methodology that measures risk and plan to incorporate the methodology into policy. Although CBP and FAA have updated their methodologies, their policies do not require methodologies that fully align with the ISC standard. As a result, these agencies miss the opportunity for a more informed assessment of the risk to their facilities. All four agencies reported facing management challenges in conducting physical security assessments or monitoring assessment results. Specifically, CBP, ARS, and the Forest Service have not met the ISC's required time frame of every 3 years for conducting assessments. For example, security specialists have not conducted required reassessments of two ARS and one Forest Service higher-level facilities. While these three agencies have plans to address backlogs, CBP's plan does not balance conducting risk assessments with other competing security priorities, such as updating its policy manual, and ARS and the Forest Service lack a means to monitor completion of future assessments. Furthermore, CBP, ARS, and the Forest Service did not have the data or information systems to monitor assessment schedules or the status of countermeasures at facilities, and their policies did not specify such data requirements. For example, ARS and the Forest Service do not collect and analyze security-related data, such as countermeasures' implementation. FAA does not routinely monitor the performance of its physical security program. Without improved monitoring, agencies are not well equipped to prioritize their highest security needs, may leave facilities' vulnerabilities unaddressed, and may not take corrective actions to meet physical security program objectives. This is a public version of a sensitive report that GAO issued in August 2017. Information that the agencies under review deemed sensitive has been omitted. GAO recommends: (1) that CBP and FAA update policies to require the use of methodologies fully aligned with the ISC Standard; (2) that CBP revise its plan to eliminate the assessments backlog; and (3) that all four agencies improve monitoring of their physical security programs. All four agencies agreed with the respective recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6755}

CMS and the states oversee Medicaid, whose size, structure, and diversity make it vulnerable to improper payments. CMS estimates the Medicaid improper payment rate annually through its PERM, which includes an estimate for Medicaid managed care, in which states contract with MCOs to provide services to Medicaid enrollees. GAO was asked to study the PERM methodology for managed care. In this report, GAO examined the extent to which the PERM accounts for program integrity risks in Medicaid managed care, including CMS's and states' oversight. GAO identified program integrity risks reported in 27 federal and state audits and investigations issued between January 2012 and September 2017; reviewed federal regulations and guidance on the PERM and CMS's Focused Program Integrity Reviews; and contacted program integrity officials in the 16 states with a majority of 2016 Medicaid spending for managed care, as well as CMS officials and program integrity experts. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) estimate of improper payments for Medicaid managed care has limitations that are not mitigated by the agency's and states' current oversight efforts. One component of the Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) measures the accuracy of capitated payments, which are periodic payments that state Medicaid agencies make to managed care organizations (MCO) to provide services to enrollees and to cover other allowable costs, such as administrative expenses. However, the managed care component of the PERM neither includes a medical review of services delivered to enrollees, nor reviews of MCO records or data. Further, GAO's review of the 27 federal and state audits and investigations identified key program risks. Ten of the 27 federal and state audits and investigations identified about $68 million in overpayments and unallowable MCO costs that were not accounted for by PERM estimates; another of these investigations resulted in a $137.5 million settlement. These audits and investigations were conducted over more than 5 years and involved a small fraction of the more than 270 MCOs operating nationwide as of September 2017. To the extent that overpayments and unallowable costs are unidentified and not removed from the cost data used to set capitation rates, they may allow inflated MCO payments and minimize the appearance of program risks in Medicaid managed care. CMS and states have taken steps to improve oversight of Medicaid managed care through updated regulations, focused reviews of states' managed care programs, and federal program integrity contractors' audits of managed care services. However, some of these efforts went into effect only recently, and others are unlikely to address the risks in managed care across all states. Furthermore, these efforts do not ensure the identification and reporting of overpayments to providers and unallowable costs by MCOs. Federal internal control standards call for agency management to identify and respond to risks. Without addressing key risks, such as the extent of overpayments and unallowable costs, CMS cannot be certain that its estimated improper payment rate for managed care (0.3 percent compared with 12.9 percent in Medicaid fee-for-service) accurately reflects program risks. The Administrator of CMS should consider and take steps to mitigate the program risks that are not measured in the PERM, such as overpayments and unallowable costs; such an effort could include actions such as revising the PERM methodology or focusing additional audit resources on managed care.

{"pred": " The Federal Reserve (Fed) is the nation's central bank, responsible for four main functions: monetary policy, providing emergency liquidity as the lender of last resort, supervising banks and financial firms for safety and soundness, and providing payment system services. Congress delegates monetary policy to the Fed, but retains oversight to ensure the Fed adheres to its mandate of \"maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.\" The Fed defines stable prices as a long-run goal of 2% inflation, measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. It emphasizes that employment is not a fixed goal, but rather a flexible one, subject to revision based on economic assessments. Monetary policy can be used to stabilize business cycle fluctuations in the short run, while it mainly affects inflation in the long run. The Fed's conventional tool for monetary policy is to target the federal funds rate — the overnight, interbank lending rate. This report provides an overview of how monetary policy works and recent developments, a summary of the Fed's actions following the financial crisis, and ends with a brief overview of the Fed's regulatory responsibilities. In December 2008, the Fed lowered the federal funds rate to a range of 0% to 0.25%, the first time rates were ever lowered to the zero lower bound. The recession ended in 2009, but as the economic recovery consistently proved weaker than expected in the years that followed, the Fed repeatedly pushed back its time frame for raising interest rates. As a result, the economic expansion was in its seventh year and the unemployment rate was already near the Fed's estimate of full employment when it began raising rates on December 16, 2015. This was a departure from past practice—in the previous two economic expansions, the Fed began raising rates within three years of the preceding recession ending. Since then, the Fed has continued to raise rates in a series of steps to incrementally tighten monetary policy. The Fed raised rates once in 2016, three times in 2017, and four times in 2018, by 0.25 percentage points each time. The Fed has stated that \"some further gradual increases in ... the federal funds rate\" are necessary to fulfill its mandate. The Fed describes its plans as \"data dependent,\" meaning they would be altered if actual employment or inflation deviate from its forecast. Although monetary policy is now less stimulative than it had been at the zero lower bound,", "answers": ["Congress has delegated responsibility for monetary policy to the Federal Reserve (the Fed), the nation's central bank, but retains oversight responsibilities for ensuring that the Fed is adhering to its statutory mandate of \"maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.\" To meet its price stability mandate, the Fed has set a longer-run goal of 2% inflation. The Fed's control over monetary policy stems from its exclusive ability to alter the money supply and credit conditions more broadly. Normally, the Fed conducts monetary policy by setting a target for the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks borrow and lend reserves on an overnight basis. It meets its target through open market operations, financial transactions traditionally involving U.S. Treasury securities. Beginning in 2007, the federal funds target was reduced from 5.25% to a range of 0% to 0.25% in December 2008, which economists call the zero lower bound. By historical standards, rates were kept unusually low for an unusually long time to mitigate the effects of the financial crisis and its aftermath. Starting in December 2015, the Fed has been raising interest rates and expects to gradually raise rates further. The Fed raised rates once in 2016, three times in 2017, and four times in 2018, by 0.25 percentage points each time. In light of increased economic uncertainty and financial volatility, the Fed announced in January 2019 that it would be \"patient\" before raising rates again. The Fed influences interest rates to affect interest-sensitive spending, such as business capital spending on plant and equipment, household spending on consumer durables, and residential investment. In addition, when interest rates diverge between countries, it causes capital flows that affect the exchange rate between foreign currencies and the dollar, which in turn affects spending on exports and imports. Through these channels, monetary policy can be used to stimulate or slow aggregate spending in the short run. In the long run, monetary policy mainly affects inflation. A low and stable rate of inflation promotes price transparency and, thereby, sounder economic decisions. The Fed's relative independence from Congress and the Administration has been justified by many economists on the grounds that it reduces political pressure to make monetary policy decisions that are inconsistent with a long-term focus on stable inflation. But independence reduces accountability to Congress and the Administration, and recent legislation and criticism of the Fed by the President has raised the question about the proper balance between the two. While the federal funds target was at the zero lower bound, the Fed attempted to provide additional stimulus through unsterilized purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities (MBS), a practice popularly referred to as quantitative easing (QE). Between 2009 and 2014, the Fed undertook three rounds of QE. The third round was completed in October 2014, at which point the Fed's balance sheet was $4.5 trillion—five times its precrisis size. After QE ended, the Fed maintained the balance sheet at the same level until September 2017, when it began to very gradually reduce it to a more normal size. The Fed has raised interest rates in the presence of a large balance sheet through the use of two new tools—by paying banks interest on reserves held at the Fed and by engaging in reverse repurchase agreements (reverse repos) through a new overnight facility. In January 2019, the Fed announced that it would continue using these tools to set interest rates permanently, in which case the balance sheet may not get much smaller than its current size of $4 trillion. With regard to its mandate, the Fed believes that unemployment is currently lower than the rate that it considers consistent with maximum employment, and inflation is close to the Fed's 2% goal by the Fed's preferred measure. Even after recent rate increases, monetary policy is still considered expansionary. This monetary policy stance is unusually stimulative compared with policy in this stage of previous expansions, and is being coupled with a stimulative fiscal policy (larger structural budget deficit). Debate is currently focused on how quickly the Fed should raise rates. Some contend the greater risk is that raising rates too slowly at full employment will cause inflation to become too high or cause financial instability, whereas others contend that raising rates too quickly will cause inflation to remain too low and choke off the expansion."], "all_classes": null, "length": 7241}
{"pred": " The report discusses the Buy American Act of 1933, which aims to promote and preserve jobs for American workers by giving the federal government a preference for domestic end products. The Act applies to various products, including aircraft engines and medical supplies, which may be subject to its requirements. However, the Act does not apply to products purchased for use outside the United States or obtained through contracts under the micro-purchase threshold, which was generally $3,500 in fiscal year 2017. The Act defines domestic end products as those that may be subject to the requirements of the Buy American Act, and foreign end products are those that are not considered domestic under the Act. This characterization is based on the origin of the end product—that is, where the product is manufactured or produced—and not the vendor’s location. For example, a vendor located in Finland may supply end products manufactured in the United States, in which case these products would be treated as domestic products. Conversely, a vendor located in the United States may supply end products manufactured in Finland. In this case, the end products would be considered foreign. Although the Buy American Act establishes a preference for domestic end products, there are situations in which agencies can procure foreign end products through established exceptions to the Buy American requirements. In addition, under the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, the United States has waived domestic purchasing requirements—including the Buy American Act—for certain acquisitions of foreign end products from countries that are party to international trade agreements or are considered designated countries by the U.S. Trade Representative. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) outlines several exceptions that permit federal agencies to buy foreign end products. These include situations when a domestic end product is not produced in sufficient quantities or when the cost would be unreasonable to buy a domestic end product. The steps that contracting officers must take to determine or document an exception will vary depending on the circumstances of the acquisition. For example, a written determination from the Head of Contracting Activity (HCA) or a delegate may be necessary to determine non-availability in some cases. However, a written determination may not be required when an acquisition is conducted through full and open competition, is synopsized, and no domestic offer is received. Other exceptions to the Buy American Act restrictions on the purchase of foreign products, such as the exception for commercial information technology, are blanket exceptions that do not require a written determination. In addition, some agencies have specified additional considerations that must precede a determination and what level of authority is appropriate for certain", "answers": ["The Buy American Act of 1933, as amended, is the main U.S. law promoting domestic purchasing. The Act permits agencies to buy foreign end products only under certain exceptions, such as when domestic items are not available at a reasonable cost. Further, U.S. trade agreements waive the Buy American restrictions for certain products. GAO was asked to review implementation of the Buy American Act. This report assesses the extent to which (1) the federal government procures foreign products through Buy American Act exceptions and waivers; and (2) selected agencies provide training and guidance to implement the Act. GAO reviewed laws, regulations, and policies related to the Buy American Act and analyzed data for fiscal year 2017 from FPDS-NG. GAO also analyzed a non-generalizable sample of 38 contracts from DOD, HHS, DHS, and VA—the agencies with the most obligations for products in fiscal year 2017. The 38 awards selected include a mix of foreign and domestic products, as well as dollars obligated. Finally, GAO interviewed cognizant contracting and policy officials from the selected agencies. According to data reported in the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) in fiscal year 2017, foreign end products accounted for less than 5 percent—about $7.8 billion—of federal obligations for products potentially subject to the Buy American Act. Federal agencies procured foreign products using exceptions to Buy American Act requirements, as well as through waivers or when the Buy American Act did not apply, as shown in the figure. The amount of foreign end products purchased could be greater than reported in FPDS-NG, however, due to reporting errors and system limitations. GAO found that 6 of the 38 contracts reviewed from the Departments of Defense (DOD), Health and Human Services (HHS), Homeland Security (DHS), and Veterans Affairs (VA) inaccurately recorded waiver or exception information. FPDS-NG system limitations compound these errors because it does not fully capture Buy American Act data. Among other things, the database does not always enable agencies to report the use of exceptions or waivers on contracts for both foreign and domestic products, reducing data accuracy. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is considering strategies to improve Buy American Act data. The four agencies GAO reviewed varied in their approaches to Buy American Act training and guidance. DOD reports that it will have trained more than 18,000 personnel by the end of 2018. DHS reports training almost 1,400 people—approximately 94 percent of its contracting staff—as of April 2018. Some VA courses mention the Act, but none is focused specifically on implementing its requirements. HHS does not have agency-level training or guidance on the Act. GAO found that contracting officers for the contracts it reviewed face challenges implementing Buy American Act requirements. Having specific and targeted Buy American Act guidance and training can better ensure that agencies meet the Act's requirements.

NG911 represents the next evolution in 911 services by using IP-based technology to deliver and process 911 traffic. Under NG911, call centers will continue to receive voice calls and location information, but will also be able to accommodate emergency communications from the range of technologies in use today. In addition, NG911 systems provide call centers with enhanced capabilities to route and transfer calls and data, which could improve call centers’ abilities to handle overflow calls and increase information sharing with first responders. The transition to NG911 may require a variety of technical and operational changes to current 911 systems and processes, including upgrades to networks or installing new hardware or software in 911 call centers. These changes may also have effects on 911 funding and state and local governance structures.

However, the nation's legacy 911 system relies on aging infrastructure that is not designed to accommodate modern communications technologies. As a result, states and localities are upgrading to NG911, which offers improved capabilities, such as the ability to process images, audio files, and video. While deploying NG911 is the responsibility of state and local entities, federal agencies also support implementation, led by NHTSA's National 911 Program, which facilitates collaboration among federal, state, and local 911 stakeholders. GAO was asked to review NG911 implementation nationwide. This report examines: (1) state and local progress and challenges in implementing NG911 and (2) federal actions to address challenges and planned next steps. GAO reviewed relevant statutes, regulations, and federal agency reports and plans. GAO also analyzed NHTSA's survey data on state 911 implementation for calendar year 2015, the most recent year for which data were available, and interviewed federal officials, state and local officials from nine states (selected to represent different regions and various phases of NG911 implementation), and officials from industry and advocacy groups. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) National 911 Program's most recent national survey on Next Generation 911 (NG911) implementation indicated that about half of states were in some phase of transition to NG911 in 2015, but that state and local progress varied. Specifically, 10 states reported that all 911 authorities in their state processed calls using NG911 systems; however, 18 states reported having no state or local NG911 transition plans in place—which may indicate these states were in the early phases of planning for the transition to NG911 or had not yet begun. GAO spoke with state and local 911 officials in 9 states, which were in various phases of implementing NG911, and found that none of the 9 selected states were accepting images, audio files, or video. State and local 911 officials identified a number of challenges to implementing NG911. Such challenges are related to funding, evolving technology and operations, and governance. For example, officials in 3 states said that the current funding they collect from telephone service subscribers may not be sufficient to support NG911's transition costs while simultaneously funding the operation of existing 911 systems. Federal agencies—including NHTSA, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the Federal Communications Commission, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security—have responsibilities to support NG911 implementation, such as through coordinating activities and administering grants, and are taking actions to assist state and local entities in addressing challenges to NG911's implementation. Such actions include developing resources, offering technical assistance, and convening stakeholders to explore emerging NG911 issues. For example, as the lead entity for coordinating federal NG911 efforts, NHTSA's National 911 Program is developing resources on NG911 topics, such as federal funding and governance structures. While the National 911 Program is taking steps to facilitate the state and local transition to NG911, the program lacks specific performance goals and measures to assess its progress. Without such goals and measures, it is not clear to what extent the program is effectively achieving its mission. In 2018, the National 911 Program plans to establish an interagency initiative tasked with creating a National NG911 Roadmap. This roadmap is intended to identify next steps for the federal government in supporting the creation of a national, interconnected NG911 system. While the National 911 Program is taking steps to develop a list of national-level tasks as part of its roadmap initiative, the program does not have a plan to identify: (1) roles or responsibilities for federal entities to carry out these tasks or (2) how the program plans to achieve the roadmap's objectives. Collaborating with the appropriate federal agencies to determine federal roles and responsibilities to carry out the roadmap's national-level tasks could reduce barriers to agencies effectively working together to achieve those tasks. Furthermore, developing an implementation plan that details how the roadmap's tasks will be achieved would place the National 911 Program in a better position to effectively lead interagency efforts to implement NG911 nationwide.

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report explains that the RRB administers retirement, survivor, disability, unemployment, and sickness insurance for railroad workers and their families under the RRA and RUIA. These acts cover workers in interstate commerce railroads and related subsidiaries, associations, and labor organizations. The report mentions that railroad workers receive benefits under RRA instead of Social Security, and those with nonrailroad experience get benefits based on their railroad service duration. \n\nThe number of railroad workers has been declining since the 1950s, but there have been recent increases, peaking in April 2015 at 253,000 workers, the highest since November 1999. However, the number declined through FY2017 to 221,000 workers. The total number of beneficiaries under RRA and RUIA decreased from 623,000 in FY2008 to 574,000 in FY2017. Benefit payments increased from $10.1 billion to $12.6 billion during the same time. In FY2017, the RRB paid nearly $12.5 billion in retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to approximately 548,000 beneficiaries. Almost $105.4 million in unemployment and sickness benefits were paid to approximately 28,000 claimants.\n\nThe report discusses the programs under RRA and RUIA, including how each program is financed, the eligibility rules, and the types of benefits available to railroad workers and family members.

During FY2017, the RRB paid nearly $12.5 billion in retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to approximately 548,000 beneficiaries and paid $105.4 million in unemployment and sickness benefits to approximately 28,000 claimants. Of the total $12.5 billion benefit payments in the same fiscal year, 60.0% was paid to retired workers, 8.0% to disabled workers, 14.4% to spouses, and 16.8% to survivors. The Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) authorizes retirement, disability, and survivor benefits for railroad workers and their families. RRA is financed primarily by payroll taxes, financial interchanges from Social Security, and transfers from the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT). Railroad retirement payroll taxes have two tiers: the Tier I tax is essentially the same as the Social Security payroll tax and the Tier II tax is set each year based on the railroad retirement system's asset balances, benefit payments, and administrative costs. In FY2017, the gross RRA funding was about $12.7 billion. Railroad retirement annuities are also divided into two tiers. Tier I annuities are designed to be nearly equivalent to Social Security benefits and are based on both railroad retirement and Social Security-covered employment. However, Tier I annuities are more generous than Social Security benefits in certain situations. For example, at the age of 60, railroad workers with at least 30 years of covered railroad work may receive unreduced retirement annuities. Tier II annuities are similar to private pensions and based solely on covered railroad service. Tier II annuities are paid in addition to Tier I annuities. Railroad disability annuities may be payable to totally disabled railroad workers who are permanently disabled from all work and occupational disabled workers who are found to be permanently disabled from their regular railroad occupations. Eligible spouses and survivors of railroad workers may receive a certain portion of Tier I and Tier II benefits, but divorced spouses and surviving divorced spouses are eligible for only a certain portion of Tier I benefits. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA) authorizes unemployment and sickness benefits for railroad workers.

{"pred": " The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is responsible for providing health care, benefits, and memorials to veterans, with a mission to ensure their health, welfare, and dignity. The VA operates one of the largest health care delivery systems in America, providing health care to millions of veterans and their families at more than 1,500 facilities. The department’s three major components—the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA)—are primarily responsible for carrying out its mission. VHA provides health care services, including primary care and specialized care, and performs research and development to improve veterans’ needs. VBA provides a variety of benefits to veterans and their families, including disability compensation, educational opportunities, assistance with home ownership, and life insurance. NCA provides burial and memorial benefits to veterans and their families. Collectively, the three components rely on approximately 340,000 employees to provide services and benefits. These employees work in VA’s Washington, D.C. headquarters, as well as 170 medical centers, approximately 750 community-based outpatient clinics, 300 veterans centers, 56 regional offices, and more than 130 cemeteries situated throughout the nation. The use of IT is critically important to VA’s efforts to provide benefits and services to veterans. As such, the department operates and maintains an IT infrastructure that is intended to provide the backbone necessary to meet the day-to-day operational needs of its medical centers, veteran-facing systems, benefits delivery systems, memorial services, and all other systems supporting the department’s mission. The infrastructure is to provide for data storage, transmission, and communications requirements necessary to ensure the delivery of reliable, available, and responsive support to all VA staff offices and administration customers, as well as veterans. According to department data as of October 2016, there were 576 active or in-development systems in VA’s inventory of IT systems. These systems are intended to be used for the determination of benefits, benefits claims processing, and access to health records, among other services. VHA is the parent organization for 319 of these systems. Of the 319 systems, 244 were considered mission-related and provide capabilities related to veterans’ health care delivery.

However, VA has faced challenges spanning a number of critical initiatives related to modernizing its major systems. To improve all major federal agencies' acquisitions and hold them accountable for reducing duplication and achieving cost savings, in December 2014 Congress enacted federal IT acquisition reform legislation (commonly referred to as the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act , or FITARA). GAO was asked to summarize its previous and ongoing work regarding VA's history of efforts to modernize VistA, including past use of contractors, and the department's recent effort to acquire a commercial electronic health record system to replace VistA. GAO was also asked to provide an update on VA's progress in key FITARA-related areas, including (1) data center consolidation and optimization, (2) incremental system development practices, and (3) software license management. VA generally agreed with the information upon which this statement is based. For nearly two decades, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has undertaken multiple efforts to modernize its health information system—the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (known as VistA). Two of VA's most recent efforts included the Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) program, a joint program with the Department of Defense (DOD) intended to replace separate systems used by VA and DOD with a single system; and the VistA Evolution program, which was to modernize VistA with additional capabilities and a better interface for all users. VA has relied extensively on assistance from contractors for these efforts. VA obligated over $1.1 billion for contracts with 138 contractors during fiscal years 2011 through 2016 for iEHR and VistA Evolution. Contract data showed that the 15 key contractors that worked on both programs accounted for $741 million of the funding obligated for system development, project management, and operations and maintenance to support the two programs (see figure). VA recently announced that it intends to change its VistA modernization approach and acquire the same electronic health record system that DOD is implementing. With respect to key FITARA-related areas, the department has reported progress on consolidating and optimizing its data centers, although this progress has fallen short of targets set by the Office of Management and Budget. VA has also reported $23.61 million in data center-related cost savings, yet does not expect to realize further savings from additional closures. In addition, VA's Chief Information Officer (CIO) certified the use of adequate incremental development for 10 of the department's major IT investments; however, VA has not yet updated its policy and process for CIO certification as GAO recommended. Finally, VA has issued a software licensing policy and has generated an inventory of its software licenses to inform future investment decisions.

For example, climate change can increase the frequency and intensity of natural disasters, causing populations to move from an area. Climate change can also intensify slow-onset disasters, such as drought, crop failure, or sea level rise, potentially altering longer-term migration trends. GAO was asked to review how U.S. agencies address climate change as a potential driver of global migration. For State, USAID, and DOD, this report (1) describes executive branch actions related to climate change and migration from fiscal years 2014 through 2018; (2) examines the extent to which the agencies discussed the potential effects of climate change on migration in their plans and risk assessments; and (3) describes agency activities on the issue. GAO analyzed documents on administration priorities; reviewed agency plans, risk assessments, and documentation of agency activities; and interviewed agency officials. From fiscal years 2014 through 2018, a variety of executive branch actions related to climate change—such as executive orders and strategies—affected the Department of State (State), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Department of Defense (DOD), including their activities that could potentially address the nexus of climate change and migration. For example, a fiscal year 2016 presidential memorandum—rescinded in 2017—required agencies to develop implementation plans to identify the potential impact of climate change on human mobility, among other things. In general, however, climate change as a driver of migration was not a focus of the executive branch actions. For example, a fiscal year 2014 executive order—also rescinded in 2017—requiring agencies to prepare for the impacts of climate change did not highlight migration as a particular concern. State, USAID, and DOD have discussed the potential effects of climate change on migration in agency plans and risk assessments. For example, State and USAID required climate change risk assessments when developing country and regional strategies, and a few of the strategies reviewed by GAO identified the nexus of climate change and migration as a risk. However, State changed its approach in 2017, no longer providing missions with guidance on whether and how to include climate change risks in their integrated country strategies. In doing so, State did not include in its 2018 guidance to the missions any information on how to include climate change risks, should the missions choose to do so. Without clear guidance, State may miss opportunities to identify and address issues related to climate change as a potential driver of migration. The three agencies have been involved in climate change related activities but none were specifically focused on the nexus with global migration. For example, USAID officials said that the agency's adaptation efforts, such as its Pastoralist Areas Resilience Improvement through Market Expansion project in Ethiopia, were the most likely to include activities, such as enhancing resilience, that can indirectly address the issue of climate change as a driver of migration. GAO recommends that State provide missions with guidance that clearly documents its process for climate change risk assessments for country strategies.

It traces the evolution of these powers from the 18th century, highlighting how the U.S. Constitution's silence on emergency power led to ad hoc executive actions during crises. The report discusses the expansion of emergency powers through various statutes, including the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA) and the National Emergencies Act (NEA).

IEEPA, like the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA) from which it branched, sits at the center of the modern U.S. sanctions regime. Changes in the use of IEEPA powers since the act's enactment in 1977 have caused some to question whether the statute's oversight provisions are robust enough given the sweeping economic powers it confers upon the President upon declaration of a state of emergency. Over the course of the twentieth century, Congress delegated increasing amounts of emergency power to the President by statute. The Trading with the Enemy Act was one such statute. Congress passed TWEA in 1917 to regulate international transactions with enemy powers following the U.S. entry into the First World War. Congress expanded the act during the 1930s to allow the President to declare a national emergency in times of peace and assume sweeping powers over both domestic and international transactions. Between 1945 and the early 1970s, TWEA became a critically important means to impose sanctions as part of U.S. Cold War strategy. Presidents used TWEA to block international financial transactions, seize U.S.-based assets held by foreign nationals, restrict exports, modify regulations to deter the hoarding of gold, limit foreign direct investment in U.S. companies, and impose tariffs on all imports into the United States. Following committee investigations that discovered that the United States had been in a state of emergency for more than 40 years, Congress passed the National Emergencies Act (NEA) in 1976 and IEEPA in 1977. The pair of statutes placed new limits on presidential emergency powers. Both included reporting requirements to increase transparency and track costs, and the NEA required the President to annually assess and extend, if appropriate, the emergency. However, some experts argue that the renewal process has become pro forma. The NEA also afforded Congress the means to terminate a national emergency by adopting a concurrent resolution in each chamber. A decision by the Supreme Court, in a landmark immigration case, however, found the use of concurrent resolutions to terminate an executive action unconstitutional. Congress amended the statute to require a joint resolution, significantly increasing the difficulty of terminating an emergency. Like TWEA, IEEPA has become an important means to impose economic-based sanctions since its enactment; like TWEA, Presidents have frequently used IEEPA to restrict a variety of international transactions; and like TWEA, the subjects of the restrictions, the frequency of use, and the duration of emergencies have expanded over time. Initially, Presidents targeted foreign states or their governments. Over the years, however, presidential administrations have increasingly used IEEPA to target individuals, groups, and non-state actors such as terrorists and persons who engage in malicious cyber-enabled activities. As of March 1, 2019, Presidents had declared 54 national emergencies invoking IEEPA, 29 of which are still ongoing. Typically, national emergencies invoking IEEPA last nearly a decade, although some have lasted significantly longer--the first state of emergency declared under the NEA and IEEPA, which was declared in response to the taking of U.S. embassy staff as hostages by Iran in 1979, may soon enter its fifth decade. IEEPA grants sweeping powers to the President to control economic transactions. Despite these broad powers, Congress has never attempted to terminate a national emergency invoking IEEPA. Instead, Congress has directed the President on numerous occasions to use IEEPA authorities to impose sanctions. Congress may want to consider whether IEEPA appropriately balances the need for swift action in a time of crisis with Congress' duty to oversee executive action. Congress may also want to consider IEEPA's role in implementing its influence in U.S. foreign policy and national security decision-making."], "all_classes": null, "length": 14753}
{"pred": " The report provides an overview of the U.S. pipeline system, highlighting its scale, types, and associated security challenges.

Interstate pipelines run through remote areas and highly populated urban areas, and are vulnerable to accidents, operating errors, and malicious physical and cyber-based attack or intrusion. The energy sector accounted for 35 percent of the 796 critical infrastructure cyber incidents reported to DHS from 2013 to 2015. Several federal and private entities have roles in pipeline security. TSA is primarily responsible for the oversight of pipeline physical security and cybersecurity. GAO was asked to review TSA's efforts to assess and enhance pipeline security and cybersecurity. This report examines, among other objectives: (1) the guidance pipeline operators reported using to address security risks and the extent that TSA ensures its guidelines reflect the current threat environment; (2) the extent that TSA has assessed pipeline systems' security risks; and (3) the extent TSA has assessed its effectiveness in reducing pipeline security risks. GAO analyzed TSA documents, such as its Pipeline Security Guidelines ; evaluated TSA pipeline risk assessment efforts; and interviewed TSA officials, 10 U.S. pipeline operators—selected based on volume, geography, and material transported—and representatives from five industry associations. Pipeline operators reported using a range of guidelines and standards to address physical and cybersecurity risks, including the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) Pipeline Security Guidelines , initially issued in 2011. TSA issued revised guidelines in March 2018 to reflect changes in the threat environment and incorporate most of the principles and practices from the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity . However, TSA's revisions do not include all elements of the current framework and TSA does not have a documented process for reviewing and revising its guidelines on a regular basis. Without such a documented process, TSA cannot ensure that its guidelines reflect the latest known standards and best practices for physical security and cybersecurity, or address the dynamic security threat environment that pipelines face. Further, GAO found that the guidelines lack clear definitions to ensure that pipeline operators identify their critical facilities. GAO's analysis showed that operators of at least 34 of the nation's top 100 critical pipeline systems (determined by volume of product transported) deemed highest risk had identified no critical facilities. This may be due, in part, to the guidelines not clearly defining the criteria to determine facilities' criticality. To assess pipeline security risks, TSA conducts pipeline security reviews—Corporate Security Reviews and Critical Facility Security Reviews—to assess pipeline systems' vulnerabilities. However, GAO found that the number of TSA security reviews has varied considerably over the last several years, as shown in the table on the following page. TSA officials stated that staffing limitations have prevented TSA from conducting more reviews. Staffing levels for TSA's Pipeline Security Branch have varied significantly since fiscal year 2010 with the number of staff ranging from 14 full-time equivalents in fiscal years 2012 and 2013 to 1 in 2014. Further, TSA does not have a strategic workforce plan to help ensure it identifies the skills and competencies—such as the required level of cybersecurity expertise—necessary to carry out its pipeline security responsibilities. By establishing a strategic workforce plan, TSA can help ensure that it has identified the necessary skills, competencies, and staffing. GAO also identified factors that likely limit the usefulness of TSA's risk assessment methodology for prioritizing pipeline system reviews. Specifically, TSA has not updated its risk assessment methodology since 2014 to reflect current threats to the pipeline industry. Further, its sources of data and underlying assumptions and judgments regarding certain threat and vulnerability inputs are not fully documented. In addition, the risk assessment has not been peer reviewed since its inception in 2007. Taking steps to strengthen its risk assessment, and initiating an independent, external peer review would provide greater assurance that TSA ranks relative risk among pipeline systems using comprehensive and accurate data and methods. TSA has established performance measures to monitor pipeline security review recommendations, analyze their results, and assess effectiveness in reducing risks. However, these measures do not possess key attributes—such as clarity, and having measurable targets—that GAO has found are key to successful performance measures. By taking steps to ensure that its pipeline security program performance measures exhibit these key attributes, TSA could better assess its effectiveness at reducing pipeline systems' security risks. Pipeline Security Branch officials also reported conducting security reviews as the primary means for assessing the effectiveness of TSA's efforts to reduce pipeline security risks. However, TSA has not tracked the status of Corporate Security Review recommendations for the past 5 years. Until TSA monitors and records the status of these reviews' recommendations, it will be hindered in its efforts to determine whether its recommendations are leading to significant reduction in risk. GAO makes 10 recommendations to TSA to improve its pipeline security program management (many are listed on the next page), and DHS concurred. GAO recommends, among other things, that the TSA Administrator take the following actions: implement a documented process for reviewing, and if deemed necessary, for revising TSA's Pipeline Security Guidelines at defined intervals; clarify TSA's Pipeline Security Guidelines by defining key terms within its criteria for determining critical facilities; develop a strategic workforce plan for TSA's Security Policy and Industry Engagement‘s Surface Division; update TSA's pipeline risk assessment methodology to include current data to ensure it reflects industry conditions and threats; fully document the data sources, underlying assumptions and judgments that form the basis of TSA's pipeline risk assessment methodology; take steps to coordinate an independent, external peer review of TSA's pipeline risk assessment methodology; ensure the Security Policy and Industry Engagement‘s Surface Division has a suite of performance measures which exhibit key attributes of successful performance measures; and enter information on Corporate Security Review recommendations and monitor and record their status."], "all_classes": null, "length": 15361}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report to understand the main points. The report is about the U.S. global defense posture, specifically in Europe, and the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI). \n\nFirst, the report explains that global defense posture is crucial for U.S. military operations and communicating strategic interests. It's guided by the National Defense Strategy and National Military Strategy, with DOD Instruction 3000.12 outlining three elements: Forces, Footprint, and Agreements. EUCOM is one of the six geographic combatant commands responsible for missions in Europe, parts of Asia, the Middle East, and the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans. \n\nThe report mentions that the number of U.S. military sites in EUCOM's area of responsibility and the number of military personnel assigned to Europe have decreased substantially since the end of the Cold War. By the end of fiscal year 2014, two heavy combat brigades had been deactivated. As of May 2016, EUCOM supported one airborne infantry brigade and one Stryker brigade, along with approximately 62,000 military personnel across about 250 sites. \n\nThen there's a discussion about the Department of Defense's efforts to estimate and report the total cost of its global defense posture. The report points out that in 2009, there were weaknesses in DOD's approach for adjusting its global defense posture, and recommendations were made, such as issuing guidance for estimating total costs and modifying annual reports to include cost estimates. \n\nIn 2011, the report noted that EUCOM lacked comprehensive cost data in a key posture planning document, which hindered decision-makers from making informed decisions. Recommendations included revising posture planning guidance to include cost analysis and requiring posture plans to include comprehensive cost estimates. \n\nDOD agreed with these recommendations and took steps to implement them. However, the report also highlights that DOD's approach to estimating the cost of ERI initiatives has not fully addressed the need for long-term cost estimates and that the department is not providing Congress with future cost projections. \n\nThe report discusses the changes in ERI's objectives, including deterring Russian aggression and developing the capacity to field a credible combined force. DOD has requested increased ERI funding, with approximately $4.5 billion requested for posture enhancements through the end of fiscal year 2017. \n\nThe", "answers": ["In response to Russia's annexation of Crimea in March 2014, the President announced the ERI, to reassure allies in Europe of U.S. commitment to their security. This initiative has been funded using OCO appropriations, which Congress provides in addition to DOD's base budget appropriations. The Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the Continuing Appropriations and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017, included a provision for GAO to review matters related to ERI. In this report, we (1) describe changes in ERI's objectives, funding under ERI, and DOD's posture in Europe since 2014 and (2) evaluate the extent to which DOD's planning processes for posture initiatives funded under ERI prioritize those initiatives, estimate their long-term costs, and communicate their estimated costs to Congress. GAO analyzed DOD strategy documentation, budget and cost analysis guidance, budget justification materials, and cost and obligations data. GAO also interviewed knowledgeable officials within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, U.S. European Command, the military services, and the State Department. Since 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) has expanded the European Reassurance Initiative's (ERI) objectives, increased its funding, and planned enhancements to European posture. DOD expanded ERI's objectives from the short-term reassurance of allies and partners to include deterring Russian aggression in the long term and developing the capacity to field a credible combined force should deterrence fail. With respect to funding, DOD will have requested approximately $4.5 billion for ERI's posture enhancements through the end of fiscal year 2017 (about $3.2 billion for fiscal year 2017 alone), and in July 2016 EUCOM identified funding needs for future posture initiatives. The expansion of ERI's objectives has contributed to DOD's enhancing its posture in Europe. Specifically, DOD has increased the size and duration of Army combat unit deployments, planned to preposition Army equipment in Eastern Europe, added new enduring locations (e.g., locations that DOD expects to access and use to support U.S. security interests for the foreseeable future), improved infrastructure, and negotiated new agreements with European nations. As of April 2017, DOD was considering further force enhancements under ERI as part of the department's ERI budget request. DOD also was reviewing whether new enduring locations to support ERI were needed and was considering other improvements to existing infrastructure. DOD's process for planning ERI has not established priorities among posture initiatives funded under ERI relative to those in its base budget, nor estimated long-term sustainment costs for some posture initiatives funded under ERI, nor communicated future costs to Congress. ERI is being planned using a separate process from DOD's established processes and is funded from DOD's overseas contingency operations (OCO) appropriations. GAO found several weaknesses: Lack of prioritization : DOD establishes priorities among ERI posture initiatives but has not evaluated them against base budget initiatives using its posture management process. As a result, DOD lacks an understanding of the relative importance of ERI initiatives and may be investing in projects that it will not continue should OCO funding become unavailable. Lack of sustainment costs : EUCOM and the military services have not fully estimated the long-term costs to sustain equipment and construction funded under ERI. Based on DOD's approach for calculating rough order sustainment costs, GAO determined that these costs could be substantial. DOD officials said that GAO correctly applied DOD's approach for estimating sustainment costs, but noted that actual costs may be lower, because the military services may not fully fund sustainment. In the absence of comprehensive estimates, DOD has been limited in its ability to assess affordability and plan for future costs. Not communicating future costs : DOD limits Congress's visibility into the resources needed to implement ERI and achieve its objectives because it does not include future costs in its ERI budget request. This is a public version of a classified report issued in August 2017. Information on specific posture planning, guidance, and budget estimates that DOD deemed to be classified have been omitted from this report. GAO recommends that DOD prioritize ERI posture initiatives against initiatives in its base budget, develop cost estimates for sustaining initiatives, and communicate future costs to Congress.

The report is about Medicaid spending on long-term care, specifically assisted living facilities. It mentions that spending increased from $146 billion in 2013 to $158 billion in 2015. \n\nThe report also talks about the differences in spending between institutional settings like nursing homes and home-based services. It notes that state Medicaid programs may cover certain services in assisted living facilities, but not room and board. \n\nThere's a lot about the federal-state partnership, with CMS overseeing state Medicaid programs through regulations, approvals, technical assistance, data collection, and reviews. States handle day-to-day administration, including monitoring HCBS programs, within federal rules. Each state has a designated agency to administer Medicaid, which may delegate responsibilities to other agencies, like the Department of Aging or Mental Health. However, the state Medicaid agency is ultimately accountable to the federal government for compliance with HCBS requirements.\n\nThe report discusses the different types of HCBS programs, including HCBS waiver programs, which are the most common. These programs serve beneficiaries who need care usually provided in an institution. CMS oversees these by reviewing and approving applications and reviewing reports. \n\nThere are specific requirements for states to demonstrate they have systems in place to protect the health and welfare of beneficiaries. These include administrative authority, level of care, qualified providers, service plans, and financial accountability. \n\nCMS also provides ongoing oversight through annual reports that states must submit for each HCBS waiver program. However, there are issues with the oversight of assisted living facilities compared to nursing homes. \n\nThe report also mentions that CMS has taken steps to improve oversight of beneficiary health and welfare in HCBS programs by adding new requirements for state monitoring of critical incidents. However, the agency's ability to effectively monitor how well states are assuring beneficiary health and welfare is limited by gaps in state reporting to CMS. \n\nThe report concludes with three recommendations to CMS: provide guidance and clarify requirements regarding the monitoring and reporting of deficiencies that states using HCBS waivers are required to report on their annual reports; establish standard Medicaid reporting requirements for all states to annually report key information on critical incidents, considering at a minimum the type of critical incidents involving Medicaid beneficiaries and the type of residential facilities, including assisted living facilities, where the incidents occurred; and ensure that all states submit annual reports for HCBS waivers on time as required. \n\nThe HHS has", "answers": ["The number of individuals receiving long term care services from Medicaid in community residential settings is expected to grow.

This report (1) describes state spending on and coverage of these services, (2) describes how state Medicaid agencies oversee the health and welfare of beneficiaries in these settings, and (3) examines the extent that CMS oversees state Medicaid agency monitoring of assisted living services. GAO surveyed all state Medicaid agencies and interviewed officials in a nongeneralizeable sample of three states with varied oversight processes for their assisted living programs. GAO reviewed regulations and guidance, and interviewed CMS officials. State Medicaid agencies in 48 states that covered assisted living services reported spending more than $10 billion (federal and state) on assisted living services in 2014. These 48 states reported covering these services for more than 330,000 beneficiaries through more than 130 different programs. Most programs were operated under Medicaid waivers that allow states to target certain populations, limit enrollment, or restrict services to certain geographic areas. With respect to oversight of their largest assisted living programs, state Medicaid agencies reported varied approaches to overseeing beneficiary health and welfare, particularly in how they monitored critical incidents involving beneficiaries receiving assisted living services. State Medicaid agencies are required to protect beneficiary health and welfare and operate systems to monitor for critical incidents—cases of potential or actual harm to beneficiaries such as abuse, neglect, or exploitation. Twenty-six state Medicaid agencies could not report to GAO the number of critical incidents that occurred in assisted living facilities, citing reasons including the inability to track incidents by provider type (9 states), lack of a system to collect critical incidents (9 states), and lack of a system that could identify Medicaid beneficiaries (5 states). State Medicaid agencies varied in what types of critical incidents they monitored. All states identified physical, emotional, or sexual abuse as a critical incident. A number of states did not identify other incidents that may indicate potential harm or neglect such as medication errors (7 states) and unexplained death (3 states). State Medicaid agencies varied in whether they made information on critical incidents and other key information available to the public. Thirty-four states made critical incident information available to the public by phone, website, or in person, while another 14 states did not have such information available at all. Oversight of state monitoring of assisted living services by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is limited by gaps in state reporting. States are required to annually report to CMS information on deficiencies affecting beneficiary health and welfare for the most common program used to provide assisted living services. However, states have latitude in what they consider a deficiency. States also must describe their systems for monitoring critical incidents, but CMS does not require states to annually report data from their systems. Under federal internal control standards, agencies should have processes to identify information needed to achieve objectives and address risk. Without clear guidance on reportable deficiencies and no requirement to report critical incidents, CMS may be unaware of problems. For example, CMS found, after an in-depth review in one selected state seeking to renew its program, that the state lacked an effective system for assuring beneficiary health and welfare, including reporting insufficient information on the number of unexpected or suspicious beneficiary deaths. The state had not reported any deficiencies in annual reports submitted to CMS in 5 prior years. GAO recommendations to CMS include clarifying state requirements for reporting program deficiencies and requiring annual reporting of critical incidents. HHS concurred with GAO's recommendations to clarify deficiency reporting and stated that it would consider annual reporting requirements for critical incidents after completing an ongoing review."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6063}
{"pred": " The report outlines the regulatory frameworks for rail transportation safety in the United States, focusing on the roles of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). FRA oversees the safety of railroads operating on the general system, which includes freight railroads and intercity passenger railroads. FTA, on the other hand, regulates rail transit systems that typically serve individual metropolitan areas, using track not shared with freight and other passenger trains. Rail transit includes a variety of modes, such as heavy and light rail, streetcars, automated guideways, cable cars, and others. Rail transit is an important component of the nation’s transportation network, particularly in large metropolitan areas. Rail transit systems provided over 4.4 billion passenger trips in 2016. “Heavy rail” systems in large cities accounted for much of the total rail transit activity, including 88 percent of passenger trips in 2016. The report highlights the importance of state safety oversight for rail transit systems, noting that 61 rail transit systems within 28 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico are subject to safety oversight by one of the 31 agencies in FTA’s state safety oversight program. The states have long played a central role in conducting safety oversight of rail transit systems. The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 required, among other things, that states with rail transit operators designate an agency to oversee the safety of those systems, known as a state safety oversight agency. However, limitations have been identified in the state safety oversight program. In 2006, we reported on some state safety agency challenges in overseeing rail transit safety. Specifically, we found many of the state safety agencies lacked enough qualified staff and adequate levels of training to meet their responsibilities. In a 2009 hearing before the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, then Secretary Ray LaHood of the Department of Transportation discussed some of the weaknesses under the current state safety oversight program and introduced a public transportation safety legislative proposal. In 2010, various bills were introduced in both houses of Congress that would have provided FTA with various enforcement mechanisms and with the authority to issue safety regulations. Additionally, the bills would have required the Secretary to establish a federal certification program for employees and contractors who carry out a state public transportation safety program. In the 112th Congress, the Senate amended a House bill to include a public transportation safety provision,", "answers": ["In 2012 and 2015, DOT was provided with additional authority to oversee the safety of rail transit. Within DOT, FTA is now implementing this authority. The DOT's Office of Inspector General has reported, though, that FTA faces challenges in carrying out its enhanced safety oversight. FRA, also in DOT, has long carried out safety oversight of freight, intercity passenger, and commuter railroads. GAO was asked to review various rail safety and oversight issues, including the differences between FRA's and FTA's rail safety oversight programs. This report examines (1) key characteristics of FRA's and FTA's rail safety oversight programs and (2) strengths and limitations of FRA's and FTA's rail safety oversight programs. GAO assessed FRA's and FTA's information about rail safety oversight activities against guidance from the Office of Management and Budget, leading practices developed by the transit industry, and federal standards for internal control. GAO also interviewed stakeholders, including rail operators chosen based on mode, size, and location. The Department of Transportation's (DOT) Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and Federal Transit Administration (FTA) carry out different approaches to rail safety oversight. FRA has a more centralized safety oversight program for railroads, while FTA's program for oversight of rail transit safety largely relies on state safety agencies to monitor and enforce rail transit safety, as established in federal statute. Key characteristics of both programs include: (1) safety regulations, (2) inspections and other oversight activities, and (3) enforcement mechanisms to ensure that safety deficiencies are addressed (see figure). There are strengths and limitations to FRA's and FTA's approaches to their safety oversight missions, including how the two agencies develop safety regulations, conduct inspections, and carry out enforcement. The National Transportation Safety Board has reported, and stakeholders GAO spoke with generally agreed, that strengths of FRA's rail safety oversight program include its safety regulations, its risk-based inspection program, and its enforcement authorities. FRA also has potential limitations in its oversight framework, though, such as difficulty evaluating the effectiveness of its enforcement mechanisms. FTA has made some progress implementing changes to the rail transit safety program. However, FTA has not provided all the necessary guidance and support to states' safety agencies to ensure they develop appropriate and effective rail transit safety inspection programs. In particular, FTA has not provided states with guidance on how to develop and implement risk-based inspection programs. Though FTA has said that it will develop such guidance, it does not have a plan or timeline to do so. Without guidance from FTA on how to develop and carry out risk-based inspections, state safety agencies may not allocate their limited resources efficiently, and important safety issues may go undetected. In addition, FTA has not developed a process or methodology to evaluate whether state safety agency enforcement authorities and practices are effective. Without clear evidence that state safety agencies' enforcement is effective, states and FTA may not be able to compel rail transit operators to remedy safety deficiencies. As a result, deficiencies may remain for long periods, potentially contributing to safety incidents. GAO recommends that FTA (1) create a plan, with timeline, for developing risk-based inspection guidance for state safety agencies, and (2) develop and communicate a method for how FTA will monitor whether state safety agencies' enforcement practices are effective. DOT agreed with our recommendations. DOT, NTSB, and WMATA provided technical comments that we incorporated as appropriate."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8086}
{"pred": " The report discusses NASA's Commercial Crew Program, which aims to develop and certify crew transportation systems to ensure continued U.S. access to the International Space Station (ISS). The program has evolved through multiple phases, with NASA initially engaging several companies under Space Act agreements, which are more flexible and not subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). These agreements allowed NASA to provide technical support and funding while the contractors developed their systems. In the final two phases, NASA used FAR-based contracts, which allowed the agency to procure missions to the ISS while continuing to provide technical expertise and funding to the contractors. The program established a verification closure notice process, in which the contractors submit data to NASA to verify they have met all the requirements to be certified. This certification must occur before contractors are allowed to fly initial crewed missions to the ISS. In September 2014, NASA awarded firm-fixed-price contracts to Boeing and SpaceX, valued at up to $4.2 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, for the Commercial Crew Transportation Capability phase. Under a firm-fixed-price contract, the contractor must perform a specified amount of work for the price negotiated by the contractor and government. This is in contrast to a cost-reimbursement contract, in which the government generally agrees to pay the contractor’s allowable costs regardless of whether work is completed. The program also established a verification closure notice process, in which the contractors submit data to NASA to verify they have met all the requirements to be certified. This certification must occur before contractors are allowed to fly initial crewed missions to the ISS. The report also highlights the challenges faced by the program in ensuring the safety of the contractors’ crew transportation systems, including the risk of further delays in the contractors’ schedules. The program has not fully shared information with Congress regarding the risks of future schedule delays for the contractors, and as a result, Congress lacks insight into when the contractors will be certified. Additionally, there may be a gap in access to the ISS if the Commercial Crew Program experiences additional delays. While NASA has begun to discuss potential options, it currently does not have a contingency plan for how to ensure an uninterrupted presence on the ISS beyond 2019. The report outlines five recommendations for NASA to address these issues, including incorporating the results of its schedule risk analysis into its quarterly reports to Congress, developing a contingency plan to ensure a presence on the ISS until a Commercial Crew Program contractor is certified, documenting how the agency will determine its risk tolerance level with respect to loss of crew before the agency certification review,", "answers": ["In 2014, NASA awarded two firm-fixed-price contracts to Boeing and SpaceX, worth a combined total of up to $6.8 billion, to develop crew transportation systems and conduct initial missions to the ISS. In February 2017, GAO found that both contractors had made progress, but their schedules were under mounting pressure. The contractors were originally required to provide NASA all the evidence it needed to certify that their systems met its requirements by 2017. A House report accompanying H.R. 5393 included a provision for GAO to review the progress of NASA's human exploration programs. This report examines the Commercial Crew Program, including (1) the extent to which the contractors have made progress towards certification and (2) how NASA's certification process addresses safety of the contractors' crew transportation systems. GAO analyzed contracts, schedules, and other documentation and spoke with officials from NASA, the Commercial Crew Program, Boeing, SpaceX, and two of NASA's independent review bodies that provide oversight. Both of the Commercial Crew Program's contractors, Boeing and Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX), are making progress finalizing designs and building hardware for their crew transportation systems, but both contractors continue to delay their certification milestone (see figure). Certification is the process that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will use to ensure that each contractor's system meets its requirements for human spaceflight for the Commercial Crew Program. Further delays are likely as the Commercial Crew Program's schedule risk analysis shows that the certification milestone is likely to slip. The analysis identifies a range for each contractor, with an earliest and latest possible completion date, as well as an average. The average certification date was December 2019 for Boeing and January 2020 for SpaceX, according to the program's April 2018 analysis. Since the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011, the United States has been relying on Russia to carry astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS). Additional delays could result in a gap in U.S. access to the space station as NASA has contracted for seats on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft only through November 2019. NASA is considering potential options, but it does not have a contingency plan for ensuring uninterrupted U.S. access. NASA's certification process addresses the safety of the contractors' crew transportation systems through several mechanisms, but there are factors that complicate the process. One of these factors is the loss of crew metric that was put in place to capture the probability of death or permanent disability to an astronaut. NASA has not identified a consistent approach for how to assess loss of crew. As a result, officials across NASA have multiple ways of assessing the metric that may yield different results. Consequently, the risk tolerance level that NASA is accepting with loss of crew varies based upon which entity is presenting the results of its assessment. Federal internal controls state that management should define risk tolerances so they are clear and measurable. Without a consistent approach for assessing the metric, the agency as a whole may not clearly capture or document its risk tolerance with respect to loss of crew. GAO is making five recommendations, including that NASA develop a contingency plan for ensuring a U.S. presence on the ISS and clarify how it will determine its risk tolerance for loss of crew. NASA concurred with three recommendations; partially concurred on the recommendation related to loss of crew; and non-concurred with a recommendation to report its schedule analysis to Congress.

Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points.\n\nThe report discusses how the eight agencies are led, with different appointment methods. The first four are appointed by the President with Senate advice and consent. Then there's the Congressional Budget Office and Congressional Research Service, which are appointed by Congress. The Office of Compliance is led by an executive director appointed by the board of directors. The Library of Congress is led by the Librarian of Congress, who is appointed by the President with Senate advice and consent. The Government Publishing Office is led by the Director, appointed by the President with Senate advice and consent. The Office of the Architect of the Capitol is led by the Architect, appointed by the President with Senate advice and consent, but with a commission that recommends candidates. There have been legislative attempts to change these processes, like moving the appointment of the Architect from the President to Congress, but they haven't been enacted. The report also mentions specific bills, like H.R. 2843 and H.R. 2185, which were introduced in the 111th Congress to change the appointment process for the Architect of the Capitol. These bills aimed to shift the appointment authority from the President to congressional leaders and committees, with the Architect serving a 10-year term. However, no further action was taken on these bills. The report also touches on the appointment of the Register of Copyrights, with legislation proposed to change the process to a presidential appointment, but again, no action was taken. \n\nThe report provides details on each agency's appointment process, tenure (if set), reappointment or removal provisions, salaries, and recent appointments. For example, the Architect of the Capitol is appointed by the President with Senate advice and consent for a 10-year term, following a commission that recommends candidates. Prior to 1989, the Architect was selected by the President for an unlimited term without any formal involvement of Congress. The report also discusses the Comptroller General, who is appointed by the President with Senate advice and consent for a 15-year term, and can be removed by impeachment or joint resolution of Congress.

{"pred": " \n\nThe report discusses the role of banks in the U.S. economy, highlighting their importance in connecting borrowers to savers and allocating funds. Banks are inherently risky due to activities like extending credit and undertaking liabilities, which can lead to significant societal and economic benefits or losses. In response to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, which threatened the total collapse of the financial system and the real economy, policymakers implemented numerous changes to financial regulation, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act; P.L. 111-203) in 2010. This act aimed to strengthen regulation and address risks by implementing changes to bank regulation, including the Basel III Accords, which called for making certain bank regulations more stringent. The report also highlights the ongoing debate over the effectiveness of these regulations, with some arguing that the potential benefits (e.g., better-managed risks, increased consumer protection, greater systemic stability, potentially higher economic growth over the long term) outweigh the potential costs (e.g., compliance costs incurred by banks, reduced credit availability for consumers and businesses, potentially slower economic growth). The report further discusses the regulatory changes made by Congress, including the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCP Act; P.L. 115-174), which modified certain regulations facing small banks and banks large enough to be subjected to Dodd-Frank enhanced regulation but still below the size thresholds exceeded by the very largest banks. The report also covers the recent changes in regulation proposed by regulators, including the Community Bank Leverage Ratio (CBLR) and the Volcker Rule, which are part of the regulatory framework for bank regulation.

In response to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, many new bank regulations were implemented pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act; P.L. 111-203) or under the existing authorities of bank regulators to address apparent weaknesses in the regulatory regime. While some observers view those changes as necessary and effective, others argued that certain regulations were unjustifiably burdensome. To address those concerns, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-174) relaxed certain regulations. Opponents of that legislation argue it unnecessarily pared back important safeguards, but proponents of deregulation argue additional pare backs are needed. Meanwhile, a variety of economic and technological trends continue to affect banks. As a result, the 116th Congress faces many issues related to banking, including the following: Safety and Soundness. Banks are subject to regulations designed to reduce the likelihood of bank failures. Examples include requirements to hold a certain amount of capital (which enables a bank to absorb losses without failing) and the so-called Volcker Rule (a ban on banks' proprietary trading). In addition, anti-money laundering requirements aim to reduce the likelihood banks will execute transactions involving criminal proceeds. Banks are also required to take steps to avoid becoming victims of cyberattacks. The extent to which these regulations (i) are effective, and (ii) appropriately balance benefits and costs is a matter of debate. Consumer Protection, Fair Lending, and Access to Banking. Certain laws are designed to protect consumers and ensure that lenders use fair lending practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has authorities to regulate for consumer protection. No consensus exists on whether current regulations strike an appropriate balance between protecting consumers while ensuring access to credit and justifiable compliance costs. In addition, whether Community Reinvestment Act regulations as currently implemented effectively and efficiently encourage banks to provide services in their areas of operation is an open question. Large Banks and \"Too Big To Fail.\" Regulators also regulate for systemic risks, such as those associated with very large and complex financial institutions that may contribute to systemic instability. Dodd-Frank Act provisions include enhanced prudential regulation for certain large banks and changes to resolution processes in the event one fails. In addition, bank regulators imposed additional capital requirements on certain large, complex banks. Subsequently, some argued that certain of these additional regulations were too broadly applied and overly stringent. In response, Congress reduced the applicability of the Dodd-Frank measures and regulators have proposed changes to the capital rules. Whether relaxing these rules will provide needed relief to these banks or unnecessarily pare back important safeguards is a debated issue. Community Banks. The number of small or \"community\" banks has declined substantially in recent decades. No consensus exists on the degree to which regulatory burden, market forces, and the removal of regulatory barriers to interstate branching and banking are causing the decline. What Companies Should Be Eligible for Bank Charters. To operate legally as a bank, an institution must hold a charter granted by a state or federal government. Traditionally, these are held by companies generally focused on and led by people with experience in finance. However, recently companies with a focus on technology are interested in having legal status as a bank, either through a charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or a state-level industrial loan company charter. Policymakers disagree over whether allowing these companies to operate as banks would create appropriately regulated providers of financial services or inappropriately extend government-backed bank safety nets and disadvantage existing banks. Recent Market and Economic Trends. Changing economic forces also pose issues for the banking industry. Some observers argue that increases in regulation could drive certain financial activities into a relatively lightly regulated \"shadow banking\" sector. Innovative financial technology may alter the way certain financial services are delivered. If interest rates rise, it could create opportunities and risks. Such trends could have implications for how the financial system performs and influence debates over appropriate banking regulations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12828}
{"pred": " \n\nColombia, one of the oldest democracies in the Western Hemisphere, has endured a multifaceted civil conflict for over five decades. The conflict, which began in the 1940s with the formation of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and other leftist groups, has resulted in significant human rights violations, including noncombatant killings, kidnappings, forced displacements, and other crimes. The conflict has taken a heavy toll on Colombian society, with over 220,000 Colombians dying in the armed conflict through 2012, 81% of them civilians. The report also provides statistics quantifying the scale of the conflict, which has taken a huge toll on Colombian society: more than 23,000 selective assassinations between 1981 and 2012; internal displacement of more than 5 million Colombians due to land seizure and violence; 27,000 kidnappings between 1970 and 2010; and 11,000 deaths or amputees from anti-personnel land mines laid primarily by Colombia's main insurgent guerrilla group, the FARC. To date, more than 8 million Colombians, or roughly 15% of the population, have registered as conflict victims. Although the violence has scarred Colombia, the country has achieved a significant turnaround. Once considered a likely candidate to become a failed state, Colombia, over the past two decades, has overcome much of the violence that had clouded its future. For example, between 2000 and 2016, Colombia saw a 94% decrease in kidnappings and a 53% reduction in homicides (below 25 per 100,000 in 2016). Coupled with success in lowering violence, Colombia has opened its economy and promoted trade, investment, and growth. Colombia has become one of Latin America's most attractive locations for foreign direct investment. Yet, after steady growth over several years, Colombia's economy slowed to 3.1% growth in 2015 and declined to 1.7% in 2017.

Drug trafficking fueled the violence by funding both left-wing and right-wing armed groups. Some analysts feared Colombia would become a failed state in the late 1990s, but the Colombian government devised a new security strategy, known as Plan Colombia, to counter the insurgencies. Originally designed as a 6-year program, Plan Colombia ultimately became a 17-year U.S.-Colombian bilateral effort. The partnership focused initially on counternarcotics and later on counterterrorism; it then broadened to include sustainable development, human rights, trade, regional security, and many other areas of cooperation. Between FY2000 and FY2016, the U.S. Congress appropriated more than $10 billion to help fund Plan Colombia and its follow-on programs. For FY2018, Congress appropriated $391.3 million in foreign aid for Colombia, including assistance to promote peace and end the conflict. President Juan Manuel Santos (2010-2018) made concluding a peace accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)—the country's largest leftist guerrilla organization—his government's primary focus. Following four years of formal peace negotiations, Colombia's Congress ratified the FARC-government peace accord in November 2016. During a U.N.-monitored demobilization effort in 2017, approximately 11,000 FARC disarmed and demobilized. This figure included FARC who had been held in prison for crimes of rebellion and those making up FARC militias, who were accredited by the Colombian government as eligible to demobilize. On August 7, 2018, Iván Duque, a senator from the conservative Democratic Center party, was inaugurated to a four-year presidential term. Duque, who also worked at the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington, DC, and is Colombia's youngest president in a century, campaigned as a critic of the peace accord with the FARC. His party objected to specific measures concerning justice and political representation. Some observers maintain that his election has generated uncertainty for implementation of the accord. Shortly after taking office, Duque suspended peace talks with the National Liberation Army (ELN), the country's second-largest rebel group, which had begun under President Santos. Since the ratification of the peace accord, Colombia's long-term strategy has evolved from defeating insurgents to post-conflict stabilization. Many considered Plan Colombia and its successor strategies a remarkable advance, given the country's improvements in security and economic stability. Nevertheless, recent developments have called into question Colombia's progress. The FARC's demobilization has triggered open conflict among armed actors (including FARC dissidents and transnational criminal groups), which seek to control drug cultivation and trafficking, illegal mining, and other illicit businesses that the demobilized FARC abandoned. The ongoing lack of governance in remote rural areas recalls the conditions that originally gave rise to the FARC and other armed groups. Many observers continue to raise concerns about the country's human-rights conditions, sharp increases in coca cultivation and cocaine production, and problems stemming from the failing authoritarian government of neighboring Venezuela, which shares a nearly 1,400-mile border with Colombia. Venezuela's humanitarian crisis has set in motion an exodus of migrants, many of whom have sought temporary residence (or extended stays) in Colombia. Political upheaval has added yet more uncertainty after the United States and many other Western Hemisphere and European nations, including Colombia, called for a democratic transition in Venezuela and recognized the president of the Venezuelan National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, as the country's interim president in January 2019. The U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement went into force in May 2012. The United States remains Colombia's top trade partner.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points. The report is about the FAA's methodology for calculating the Maximum Possible Loss (MPL) for commercial space launches, as mandated by the Commercial Space Launch Act Amendments of 1988. \n\nFirst, the report explains that the 1988 amendments established a framework for federal payment of a portion of claims by third parties for injuries, damage, or loss from a commercial launch or reentry accident. The goal was to create a competitive environment for the U.S. commercial space launch industry. The act also provided government protection against some losses, known as indemnification, while minimizing taxpayer costs. \n\nThe report discusses how the FAA determines the MPL value for each launch license. It mentions that the MPL is intended to reflect the greatest dollar amount of loss to third parties and the federal government for bodily injury and property damage that can be reasonably expected to result from a launch or reentry accident. The FAA calculates separate MPL values for potential damages to third parties and the federal government. For each launch license, the FAA determines MPL values with the intent of estimating the greatest dollar amount of losses that reasonably could be expected from a launch or reentry accident, which have no less than a 1 in 10 million chance of occurring. For damages to the federal government, the MPL values are determined with the intent of estimating the greatest dollar amount of losses that reasonably could be expected from a launch or reentry accident, which have no less than a 1 in 100,000 chance of occurring. \n\nThe report also mentions that the FAA has revised two components of its MPL methodology since the 2012 report. For example, in April 2016, the agency adopted a new method for estimating the number of casualties, known as the risk profile method. This method uses different tools to simulate a range of possible scenarios to create a distribution of potential casualty numbers and the simulated probability of different levels of casualty numbers. The risk profile method replaced the FAA's \"overlay method,\" which was used since the early 1990s and didn't work well for launches of small launch vehicles in remote areas or reentries. \n\nThe report then goes into detail about the FAA's process for determining the MPL value for a launch or reentry license. It mentions that the process includes three elements: 1. Number of casualties. Estimating the number", "answers": ["The federal government shares liability risks with the commercial space launch industry for accidents that result in damages to third parties or federal property. This arrangement requires space launch companies to have a specific amount of insurance to cover these damages. The government is potentially liable for damages above that amount, up to a cap GAO estimated to be $3.1 billion in 2017, subject to appropriations in advance. CSLCA, enacted in 2015, directed the Department of Transportation, of which FAA is a part, to evaluate its MPL methodology and, if necessary, develop a plan to update that methodology. The act also included a provision requiring GAO to assess FAA's evaluation and any actions needed to update the methodology. This report discusses the extent to which (1) FAA's evaluation report addresses the requirements in CSLCA and (2) FAA has addressed previously identified weaknesses in the MPL methodology. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed FAA on its loss methodology evaluation and actions to address weaknesses. The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) report evaluating its maximum probable loss (MPL) methodology did not fully address the evaluation and consultation requirements specified by the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act (CSLCA). Balance of Risk. CSLCA required FAA to include ensuring that the federal government is not exposed to greater indemnification costs and that launch companies are not required to purchase more insurance coverage than necessary as a result of FAA's MPL methodology. FAA said that it ensured this balance by improving its methodology, but it did not reevaluate its probability thresholds after revising its methodology. These thresholds are used to divide the risk of loss between launch companies and the government. Impact on Costs. The act required FAA to consider the costs to both the industry and the federal government of implementing an updated methodology. FAA's report discussed the impact on indirect costs, such as data collection, but did not discuss direct costs: insurance premiums for launch companies and indemnification liability for the federal government. Consultation. The act also required FAA to consult with the commercial space sector and insurance providers in evaluating its MPL methodology in accordance with the preceding requirements. While the agency consulted with some stakeholders, these consultations were limited in scope. FAA officials said they have not been able to take the actions needed to fully satisfy the mandated elements because of issues such as resource limitations and the lack of available data. However, by not resolving these issues, FAA lacks assurance that launch companies are not purchasing more insurance than needed or that the federal government is not being exposed to greater indemnification costs than expected. FAA has addressed two of three previously identified weaknesses in its MPL methodology but has not yet dealt with the remaining weakness. Specifically, the agency has revised its methodology for estimating the number of potential casualties for a launch and changed the factor it uses to derive estimated property damage from estimated casualties. However, FAA has not updated the amount used for the cost of an individual casualty. GAO recommended in a March 2017 report (GAO-17-366) that FAA update this amount. Not doing so could understate the amount of insurance launch companies are required to purchase, exposing the federal government to excess risk. GAO also determined that while FAA has two tools and methods it can use in making its MPL estimates, it does not have guidance on determining which are most appropriate for a given launch scenario. For example, one tool is more comprehensive but also labor intensive to use, while the other is inappropriate for certain launch scenarios and could result in misleading MPL amounts. Officials said they have begun to create such guidance but do not have an estimated completion date. Without such guidance, FAA cannot ensure that the most appropriate MPL methodology is used for each launch. FAA should fully address mandated requirements in evaluating its MPL—probability thresholds, direct costs, and stakeholder consultations— and establish an estimated completion date for developing guidance on tools and methods to use for specific launch scenarios. The Department of Transportation concurred with the recommendations, and provided technical comments."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4125}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this Coast Guard report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points. \n\nThe report starts by giving an overview of the Coast Guard's structure and operations. It mentions the large staff, the number of aircraft and boats, and the geographic division into Pacific and Atlantic areas with districts, sectors, and stations. The headquarters handles program oversight, policy development, and personnel administration. \n\nThen there's a list of 11 statutory missions under the Homeland Security Act of 2002, grouped into six mission programs. The report discusses how the Coast Guard manages these missions, with examples like marine safety involving inspections and accident investigations, especially for commercial fishing vessels, which have a high death rate. \n\nThe Coast Guard has set goals and targets for each mission to assess performance, identify gaps, and implement corrective actions. They also need to establish targets for the current and next fiscal years, some derived from external factors like DHS's requirement for a 100% target for people in imminent danger saved in the maritime environment. \n\nHowever, there are concerns about the affordability of modernizing the Coast Guard's assets, as they are pursuing multiple new acquisitions without long-term planning. The report mentions the Coast Guard's efforts to acquire new vessels like the National Security Cutter and Fast Response Cutter, but there are issues with the data collected, such as incomplete information on the number of active commercial fishing vessels, which affects the ability to calculate accident, injury, and fatality trends. \n\nThe report also points out that the Coast Guard's performance goals, such as the five-year average of recreational boating deaths and injuries, may be underreported, making it hard to accurately assess actual injury rates. Additionally, the number of detected foreign fishing vessel incursions is questioned for its validity as a performance measure. \n\nThe report highlights several recommendations for improvement, such as enhancing the completeness of mission data, using more realistic asset performance data, improving the reliability of performance goal data, increasing transparency of data on mission performance, and improving transparency of capital planning. \n\nThe Coast Guard has agreed to these recommendations and is taking steps to implement them, such as updating data fields, engaging stakeholders, and revising process documents. However, the report indicates that further actions are needed to fully address the recommendations, especially regarding the documentation and reporting of known data limitations. \n\nAdditionally, the report mentions that the Coast Guard's Annual Performance Report (APR) has not been publicly released since 2", "answers": ["The Coast Guard, a component of DHS, serves as the principal federal agency responsible for maritime safety, security, and environmental stewardship in U.S. ports and waterways. To ensure that the Coast Guard is effectively fulfilling its missions, agency managers must have accurate information and base decisions on sound analyses for effective program management. This statement discusses Coast Guard actions needed to (1) improve the quality of data used for program management and (2) improve the transparency of its data for reporting on mission performance and planning. This statement is based on relevant products GAO issued from June 2014 through December 2017 on Coast Guard strategic planning and management issues, as well as related recommendation follow-up conducted through February 2018. GAO reviewed applicable laws, regulations, policies and guidance. GAO also interviewed Coast Guard officials responsible for administering these programs and obtained information on how they used data to inform decisionmaking. GAO interviewed a range of stakeholders, including federal and industry officials. GAO's prior work recommended multiple actions to improve the Coast Guard's program management by improving the quality of data it uses to manage and report on its mission performance. Specifically, GAO recommended actions such as collecting more complete data and clarifying the data limitations to facilitate more effective program management. For example, in December 2017, GAO found that more information is needed to calculate vessel safety statistics that could enhance the Coast Guard's knowledge about accident, injury, and fatality trends involving commercial fishing vessels. Having more complete information could be useful to carrying out its marine safety mission, and GAO recommended, among other things, that the Coast Guard ensure that data collected during commercial fishing vessel incident investigations is accurately captured. In 2018, the Coast Guard reported taking initial steps to capture more accurate data. GAO's prior work also identified areas where the Coast Guard could improve the transparency of the data it uses for reporting on its mission performance as well its capital planning purposes. For example, in an October 2017 report on performance goals, GAO found the Coast Guard's Annual Performance Report (APR) has not been released publicly since 2011. Consequently, there has not been full visibility over performance across all of the Coast Guard's missions. Coast Guard officials stated that a decision by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership to limit the number of performance goals shared publicly had deterred the Coast Guard from public release of its APR. GAO recommended that APRs be available on the Coast Guard's website; the Coast Guard plans to publicly release future APRs. In addition, previous GAO reports found that the Coast Guard's annual 5-year capital investment plan, which projects acquisition funding needs for the upcoming 5 years, did not consistently reflect current total cost estimates or the effects of tradeoffs made as part of the annual budget cycle. GAO made recommendations to help the Coast Guard plan for future acquisitions and the difficult trade off decisions it will face given funding constraints. The Coast Guard agreed, but it is unclear when it will complete the 20-year plan. GAO is not making new recommendations in this statement but has made them to the Coast Guard and DHS in the past on improving its program management through, among other things, better quality and more transparent data. DHS and the Coast Guard agreed with these recommendations and reported actions or plans to address them."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2542}
{"pred": " The report discusses the history and current state of federal small business contracting programs in the United States. It begins by explaining how these programs were established in 1953, following World War II and the Korean War, when Congress recognized that the existence of thousands of small business concerns was being threatened by war-induced shortages of materials and an inability to obtain defense contracts or financial assistance. In response, Congress passed and President Dwight Eisenhower signed into law the Small Business Act (P.L. 83-163), which authorized the Small Business Administration (SBA). The act specifies that it is the declared policy of Congress to promote the interests of small businesses to \"preserve free competitive enterprise.\" Congress specified that one of the ways to preserve free competitive enterprise was to insure that small businesses received a \"fair proportion\" of federal contracts and subcontracts. The report also discusses the various federal programs, requirements, procurement officers, and procurement offices involved in promoting federal contracting and subcontracting with small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs), SDBs participating the SBA's \"8(a) Program,\" Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) small businesses, women-owned small businesses (WOSBs), and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs). The SBA administers many, but not all, of these programs. It examines the following federal requirements and authorities in promoting contracting and subcontracting with small businesses: 1. The requirement that federal agencies generally reserve contracts that have an anticipated value greater than the micro-purchase threshold (currently $10,000) but not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $250,000) exclusively for small businesses unless the contracting officer is unable to obtain offers from two or more small businesses that are competitive with market prices and the quality and delivery of the goods or services being purchased. 2. The establishment of small business procurement goals, both government-wide and agency specific, to promote the awarding of contracts to small businesses. 3. The requirement that federal agencies generally set aside contracts that have an anticipated value exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold exclusively for small businesses when there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from at least two responsible small businesses offering the products of different small businesses (Rule of Two) and the award will be made at a fair market price. 4. The authority provided federal agencies to make sole source awards to small businesses when the award could not otherwise be made (e.g., only a single source is available", "answers": ["Congress has broad authority to impose requirements upon the federal procurement process, that is, the process whereby agencies obtain goods and services from the private sector. One way in which Congress has exercised this authority is by adopting measures to promote contracting and subcontracting between \"small businesses\" and federal agencies. These measures, among other things, declare a congressional policy of ensuring that a \"fair proportion\" of federal contract and subcontract dollars is awarded to small businesses; establish government-wide and agency-specific goals for the percentage of federal contract and subcontract dollars awarded to small businesses; establish an annual Small Business Goaling Report to measure progress in meeting these goals; generally require federal agencies, under specified circumstances, to reserve contracts that have an anticipated value greater than the micro-purchase threshold (currently $10,000), but not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $250,000) exclusively for small businesses; authorize federal agencies, under specified circumstances, to set aside contracts that have an anticipated value greater than the simplified acquisition threshold exclusively for small businesses; authorize federal agencies to make sole source awards to small businesses when the award could not otherwise be made (e.g., only a single source is available, under urgent and compelling circumstances); authorize federal agencies to set aside contracts for, or grant other contracting preference to, specific types of small businesses (e.g., 8(a) small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, women-owned small businesses (WOSBs) and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs)); and task the Small Business Administration (SBA) and other federal procurement officers with reviewing and restructuring proposed procurements to maximize opportunities for small business participation. Small business contracting programs generally have strong bipartisan support. However, that does not mean that these programs face no opposition, or that issues have not been raised concerning the impact and operations of specific programs. For example, small business advocates note that implementing regulations in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) narrow the reach (and impact) of some small business contracting preferences by excluding specific types of contracts, such as those listed in the Federal Supply Schedules, from FAR requirements pertaining to small business contracting. Advocates want the federal government to enact policies that reduce or eliminate such exclusions. Critics have questioned some of these programs' effectiveness, in terms of both promoting small business opportunities to win federal contracts and promoting a more diversified, robust economy. Many observers judge the relative success or failure of federal efforts to enhance small business contracting opportunities by whether federal government and individual federal agencies meet the predetermined procurement goals in the annual Small Business Goaling Report. In recent years, the federal government has generally succeeded in meeting the government-wide goals of awarding 23% of the total value of all small business eligible prime contract awards to small businesses, 5% to small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs), and 3% to SDVOSBs. It has had difficulty meeting the goals of 5% to WOSBs and 3% to HUBZone small businesses. The Small Business Goaling Report is the most convenient measure available to compare federal small business contracting performance over time, but it has limitations. For example, the SBA excludes some contracts from the report in its determination of what is \"small business eligible\" and some federal procurement activities are not included because they are not recorded in the Federal Procurement Data System—Next Generation. It also does not evaluate the effect these contracts have on small businesses, industry competitiveness, or the overall economy."], "all_classes": null, "length": 9547}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe LWCF was established in 1965 with the goal of preserving and developing outdoor recreation resources. Its main objectives were to facilitate participation in recreation and to enhance the health and vitality of U.S. citizens. The fund is authorized to receive $900 million annually, primarily from oil and gas leases on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), federal motorboat fuel tax, and surplus property sales. However, these revenues are only available if appropriated by Congress through the discretionary appropriations process. Additionally, the LWCF receives mandatory appropriations from the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA), which are not subject to annual appropriation by Congress. These can be used only for grants to states for outdoor recreation purposes.\n\nThe total revenues that have accrued throughout the program's history are $40.9 billion, but less than half have been appropriated ($18.9 billion) through FY2019. The unappropriated balance is estimated at $22.0 billion through FY2019. The LWCF Act outlines uses for the fund, with at least 40% for federal purposes and 40% for state financial assistance. Federal purposes include land and water acquisition by the federal government. State purposes involve a matching grant program for outdoor recreation.\n\nOver the years, the fund has been used for three main purposes: federal land acquisition, the state grant program, and other purposes. The state grant program has been funded for recreational planning, acquiring recreational lands and waters, and developing outdoor recreational facilities. Other purposes have been funded for various other natural resource-related programs, including facility maintenance of the land management agencies, ecosystem restoration, the Historic Preservation Fund, the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, the FS Forest Legacy program, FWS State and Tribal Wildlife Grants, the FWS Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, U.S. Geological Survey science and cooperative programs, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Indian Land and Water Claim Settlements.\n\nThe report also discusses the other purposes for which LWCF appropriations have been provided throughout the fund's history. It identifies the amount of funding contained in annual appropriations laws for other purposes and the types of purposes for which funds have been appropriated.

The LWCF Act authorizes the fund to receive $900 million annually, with the monies available only if appropriated by Congress (i.e., discretionary appropriations). The fund also receives mandatory appropriations under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA). The level of annual appropriations for the LWCF has varied since the origin of the fund in FY1965. The LWCF Act outlines uses of the fund for federal and state purposes. Of the total made available through appropriations or deposits under GOMESA, not less than 40% is to be used for \"federal purposes\" and not less than 40% is to be used to provide \"financial assistance to states.\" The act lists the federal purposes for which the President is to allot LWCF funds \"unless otherwise allotted in the appropriation Act making them available.\" These purposes primarily relate to acquisition of lands and waters (and interests therein) by the federal government. With regard to state purposes, the act authorizes a matching grant program to states for outdoor recreation purposes. Throughout the LWCF's history, appropriations acts typically have provided funds for land acquisition and outdoor recreational grants to states. Beginning in FY1998, appropriations also have been provided each year (except FY1999) to fund other purposes related to natural resources. The extent to which the LWCF should be used for purposes other than federal land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants to states, and which other purposes should be funded from the LWCF, continue to be the subject of legislation and debate in Congress. In the past few decades, Presidents have sought LWCF funds for a variety of other purposes. Congress chooses which if any of these requests to fund, and has chosen programs not sought by the President for a particular year. Among other programs, appropriations have been provided for facility maintenance of the land management agencies, ecosystem restoration, the Historic Preservation Fund, the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, the Forest Legacy Program, State and Tribal Wildlife Grants (under the Fish and Wildlife Service), the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, U.S. Geological Survey science and cooperative programs, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Indian Land and Water Claim Settlements. Since FY1998, a total of $2.7 billion has been appropriated for other purposes, of a total LWCF appropriation of $18.9 billion over the history of the fund. The Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service have received the largest shares of the total appropriations for other purposes, about $1.4 billion (53%) and $1.0.billion (38%), respectively, from FY1998 to FY2019. Several agencies shared the remaining $0.2 billion (9%) of the appropriations. Both the dollar amounts and the percentages of annual LWCF appropriations for other purposes have varied widely since FY1998. The dollar amounts have ranged from $0 in FY1999 to $456.0 million in FY2001. The percentage of annual funds provided for other purposes ranged from 0% in FY1999 to a high of 59% in both FY2006 and FY2007. In some years, the appropriation for other purposes was significantly less than the Administration requested. For instance, for FY2008, the George W. Bush Administration sought $313.1 million; the appropriation was $101.3 million. The appropriation for other purposes last exceeded $100.0 million in FY2010, and most recently was $93.3 million, in FY2019. Prior to FY2008, several other purposes typically were funded each year from LWCF. Since FY2008, funds have been appropriated annually only for grants under two programs: Forest Legacy and Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy government report about the Navy's readiness issues. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points.\n\nThe report mentions that since January 2017, the Navy has experienced four significant mishaps at sea, resulting in serious damage to ships and the loss of 17 sailors. Three of these incidents involved ships homeported in Yokosuka, Japan. The report also provides a summary of major mishaps from 2009 to 2017 in Appendix II. \n\nThe Navy currently has 277 ships, which is a 17% reduction from the 333 ships in 1998. Over the past two decades, the number of ships deployed overseas has remained roughly constant at about 100 ships, so each ship is being deployed more to maintain the same level of presence. \n\nThe report states that the Navy has been reporting persistently low readiness levels, partly due to increased deployment lengths needed to meet the high demand for its aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, and amphibious ships. For example, the deployment lengths for carrier strike groups increased from an average of 6.4 months during 2008-2011 to a less sustainable 9 months for three carrier strike groups in 2015. In 2016, the Navy extended the deployments of the Harry S Truman and Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Groups to 8 and 8.5 months, respectively. \n\nThe Navy has had to shorten, eliminate, or defer training and maintenance periods to support these high deployment rates. These decisions have resulted in declining ship conditions across the fleet and have increased the amount of time required for the shipyards to complete maintenance on these ships. Lengthened maintenance periods, in turn, compress the time that ships are available for training and operations. \n\nThe report also discusses the Navy's increased reliance on overseas homeports to maintain global presence. Since 2006, the percentage of the fleet assigned to overseas homeports has doubled. In 2006, 20 ships were homeported overseas (7% of the fleet); today, 40 ships are homeported overseas (14% of the fleet) in Japan, Spain, Bahrain, and Italy; and an additional destroyer will be homeported in Yokosuka, Japan in 2018. \n\nThe Navy attributes these, in part", "answers": ["Since January 2017, the Navy has suffered four significant mishaps at sea that resulted in serious damage to its ships and the loss of 17 sailors. Three of these incidents involved ships homeported in Japan. In response to these incidents, the Chief of Naval Operations ordered an operational pause for all fleets worldwide, and the Vice Chief of Naval Operations directed a comprehensive review of surface fleet operations, stating that these tragic incidents are not limited occurrences but part of a disturbing trend in mishaps involving U.S. ships. This statement provides information on the effects of homeporting ships overseas, reducing crew size on ships, and not completing maintenance on time on the readiness of the Navy and summarizes GAO recommendations to address the Navy's maintenance, training, and other challenges. In preparing this statement, GAO relied on work it has published since 2015 related to the readiness of ships homeported overseas, sailor training and workload issues, maintenance challenges, and other issues. GAO updated this information, as appropriate, based on Navy data. GAO's prior work shows that the Navy has increased deployment lengths, shortened training periods, and reduced or deferred maintenance to meet high operational demands, which has resulted in declining ship conditions and a worsening trend in overall readiness. The Navy has stated that high demand for presence has put pressure on a fleet that is stretched thin across the globe. Some of the concerns that GAO has highlighted include: Degraded readiness of ships homeported overseas: Since 2006, the Navy has doubled the number of ships based overseas. Overseas basing provides additional forward presence and rapid crisis response, but GAO found in May 2015 that there were no dedicated training periods built into the operational schedules of the cruisers and destroyers based in Japan. As a result, the crews of these ships did not have all of their needed training and certifications. Based on updated data, GAO found that, as of June 2017, 37 percent of the warfare certifications for cruiser and destroyer crews based in Japan—including certifications for seamanship—had expired. This represents more than a fivefold increase in the percentage of expired warfare certifications for these ships since GAO's May 2015 report. The Navy has made plans to revise operational schedules to provide dedicated training time for overseas-based ships, but this schedule has not yet been implemented. Crew size reductions contribute to sailor overwork and safety risks: GAO found in May 2017 that reductions to crew sizes the Navy made in the early 2000s were not analytically supported and may now be creating safety risks. The Navy has reversed some of those changes but continues to use a workweek standard that does not reflect the actual time sailors spend working and does not account for in-port workload—both of which have contributed to some sailors working over 100 hours a week. Inability to complete maintenance on time: Navy recovery from persistently low readiness levels is premised on adherence to maintenance schedules. However, in May 2016, GAO found that the Navy was having difficulty completing maintenance on time. Based on updated data, GAO found that, in fiscal years 2011 through 2016, maintenance overruns on 107 of 169 surface ships (63 percent) resulted in 6,603 lost operational days (i.e., the ships were not available for training and operations). Looking to the future, the Navy wants to grow its fleet by as much as 30 percent but continues to face challenges with manning, training, and maintaining its existing fleet. These readiness problems need to be addressed and will require the Navy to implement GAO's recommendations—particularly in the areas of assessing the risks associated with overseas basing, reassessing sailor workload and the factors used to size ship crews, managing investments to modernize and improve the efficiency of the naval shipyards, and applying sound planning and sustained management attention to its readiness rebuilding efforts. In addition, continued congressional oversight will be needed to ensure that the Navy demonstrates progress in addressing its maintenance, training, and other challenges. GAO made 14 recommendations in prior work cited in this statement. The Department of Defense generally concurred with all of them but has implemented only 1. Continued attention is needed to ensure that these recommendations are addressed, such as the Navy assessing the risks associated with overseas basing and reassessing sailor workload and factors used in its manpower requirements process."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3534}
{"pred": " The report discusses the concept of the digital economy and its implications for international tax policy. The digital economy encompasses various economic activities that are connected through computers, mobile phones, or other internet-connected devices. In the realm of international tax policy, certain types of activities and markets have been singled out for selective taxation by some jurisdictions—primarily in Europe. These digital economy business models operate in \"two-sided markets\" in which they provide services to individual users (sometimes at zero charge) and sell other services to businesses (e.g., advertising to users). Proponents of these \"digital services taxes\" (DSTs) justify them on a number of grounds, including the goal of having multinational corporations (MNCs) pay their \"fair share\" of taxes, taxing profits purportedly derived from consumers in their jurisdictions, or adapting traditional rules and systems of international taxation to account for new forms of \"disruptive\" business models that can be conducted virtually over the internet. U.S. opposition to these unilateral taxes has been voiced by several government officials. Robert Stack, while Treasury Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Tax Affairs under President Obama, said that such efforts are primarily political efforts to target U.S. corporations. More recently, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has issued multiple statements in opposition to unilateral taxation of digital economy businesses. Some Members of the tax-writing committees in Congress have also criticized these efforts. This report analyzes DST proposals from an economic and policy perspective as they have been introduced, discussed, and adapted in European countries. Some commentators and policymakers argue that MNCs in the digital economy are \"undertaxed\" or are not paying a \"fair share\" of taxes in their jurisdictions. Two issues that often underlie these sentiments are (1) the ability of digital economy MNCs to provide services without establishing a physical presence (or \"permanent establishment\") in the country in which their customers reside and (2) the ability of digital economy MNCs to shift their profits away from countries where they conduct real economy activity (e.g., sales, development, production) toward low-tax jurisdictions where the MNCs are conducting little to no real economic activity. Even if a country is able to establish the right to tax an MNC's profits in the digital economy (via permanent establishment rules), the profits subject to tax in that jurisdiction could be reduced via transfer pricing rules. A commonly held principle across international tax law is that there must be a substantial enough connection between a country and a corporation's activities to establish \"nexus\" in that country, enabling", "answers": ["Several countries, primarily in Europe, and the European Commission have proposed or adopted taxes on revenue earned by multinational corporations (MNCs) in certain \"digital economy\" sectors from activities linked to the user-based activity of their residents. These proposals have generally been labeled as \"digital services taxes\" (DSTs). For example, beginning in 2019, Spain is imposing a DST of 3% on online advertising, online marketplaces, and data transfer service (i.e., revenue from sales of user activities) within Spain. Only firms with €750 million in worldwide revenue and €3 million in revenues with users in Spain are to be subject to the tax. In 2020, the UK plans to implement a 3% DST that would apply only to businesses whose revenues exceed £25 million per year and groups that generate global revenues from search engines, social media platforms, and online marketplaces in excess of £500 million annually. The UK labels its DST as an \"interim\" solution until international tax rules are modified to allow countries to tax the profits of foreign MNCs if they have a substantial enough \"digital presence\" based on local users. The member states of the European Commission are also actively considering such a rule. These policies are being considered and enacted against a backdrop of ongoing, multilateral negotiations among members and nonmembers of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). These negotiations, prompted by discussions of the digital economy, could result in significant changes for the international tax system. Proponents of DSTs argue that digital firms are \"undertaxed.\" This sentiment is driven in part by some high-profile tech companies that reduced the taxes they paid by assigning ownership of their income-producing intangible assets (e.g., patents, marketing, and trade secrets) to affiliate corporations in low-tax jurisdictions. Proponents of DSTs also argue that the countries imposing tax should be entitled to a share of profits earned by digital MNCs because of the \"value\" to these business models made by participation of their residents through their content, reviews, purchases, and other contributions. Critics of DSTs argue that the taxes target income or profits that would not otherwise be subject to taxation under generally accepted income tax principles. U.S. critics, in particular, see DSTs as an attempt to target U.S. tech companies, especially as minimum thresholds are high enough that only the largest digital MNCs (such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon) will be subject to these specific taxes. DSTs are structured as a selective tax on revenue (akin to an excise tax) and not as a tax on corporate profits. A tax on corporate profits taxes the return to investment in the corporate sector. Corporate profit is equal to total revenue minus total cost. In contrast, DSTs are \"turnover taxes\" that apply to the revenue generated from taxable activities regardless of costs incurred by a firm. Additionally, international tax rules do not allow countries to tax an MNC's cross-border income solely because their residents purchase goods or services provided by that firm. Rather, ownership of assets justifies a country to be allocated a share of that MNC's profits to tax. Under these rules and their underlying principles, the fact that a country's residents purchase digital services from an MNC is not a justification to tax the MNC's profits. DSTs are likely to have the economic effect of an excise tax on intermediate services. The economic incidence of a DST is likely to be borne by purchasers of taxable services (e.g., companies paying digital economy firms for advertising, marketplace listings, or user data) and possibly consumers downstream from those transactions. As a result, economic theory and the general body of empirical research on excise taxes predict that DSTs are likely to increase prices in affected markets, decrease quantity supplied, and reduce investment in these sectors. Compared to a corporate profits tax—which, on balance, tends to be borne by higher-income shareholders—DSTs are expected to be more regressive forms of raising revenue, as they affect a broad range of consumer goods and services. Certain design features of DSTs could also create inequitable treatment between firms and increase administrative complexity. For example, minimum revenue thresholds could be set such that primarily large, foreign (and primarily U.S.) corporations are subject to tax. Requirements to identify the location of users could also introduce significant costs on businesses. This report traces the emergence of DSTs from multilateral tax negotiations in recent years, addresses various purported policy justifications of DSTs, provides an economic analysis of their effects, and raises several issues for Congress."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12505}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about commercial disclosure requirements and the First Amendment. Let me start by understanding the key points of the report.\n\nThe report discusses how the First Amendment, which protects the right to speak and the right not to speak, applies to laws that require commercial actors to disclose information to consumers. The Supreme Court has long accepted that Congress can compel certain disclosures, even those involving protected speech, without running afoul of the First Amendment. However, the Court has also emphasized that the government's ability to more freely regulate commercial speech has been linked to its general authority \"to regulate commercial transactions.\" Thus, even though commercial disclosure requirements compel speech, courts generally have not analyzed such provisions under the strict scrutiny standard. Instead, courts have often employed less rigorous standards to evaluate such provisions. The precise nature of a court's First Amendment analysis, however, will depend on the character of the disclosure requirement at issue. \n\nThe report explains that while the First Amendment usually protects even untruthful speech, in order to better encourage uninhibited and robust debate, the Court has recognized that regulating \"for truthfulness\" in the commercial arena is unlikely to \"undesirably inhibit spontaneity\" because commercial speech is generally less spontaneous. Instead, it is more calculated, motivated by a \"commercial interest.\" In particular, if a particular advertisement concerns a subject in which \"the public lacks sophistication\" and cannot verify the claims, the Court has suggested that the government may have a freer hand to address such concerns. \n\nThe report also discusses the different legal frameworks for analyzing the constitutionality of commercial disclosure requirements. It mentions that the Supreme Court in 1943 described the First Amendment's protection against compelled speech as a \"fixed star in our constitutional constellation.\" Therefore, government actions mandating speech are generally subject to strict scrutiny by courts, and will be upheld \"only if the government proves that they are narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests.\" However, the Court has also long accepted a variety of laws that require commercial actors to make certain disclosures to consumers, confirming that Congress can compel certain disclosures, even those involving protected speech, without running afoul of the First Amendment. \n\nThe report explains that commercial disclosure requirements have largely withstood constitutional scrutiny in part because, historically, commercial speech has received less protection under the First Amendment than other speech. The government's ability to more freely regulate commercial speech has been linked to its general authority \"to regulate commercial transactions.\" Thus, notwithstanding the fact that commercial disclosure requirements", "answers": ["Federal law contains a wide variety of disclosure requirements, including food labels, securities registrations, and disclosures about prescription drugs in direct-to-consumer advertising. These disclosure provisions require commercial actors to make statements that they otherwise might not, compelling speech and implicating the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. Nonetheless, while commercial disclosure requirements may regulate protected speech, that fact in and of itself does not render such provisions unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has historically allowed greater regulation of commercial speech than of other types of speech. Since at least the mid-1970s, however, the Supreme Court has been increasingly protective of commercial speech. This trend, along with other developments in First Amendment law, has led some commentators to question whether the Supreme Court might apply a stricter test in assessing commercial disclosure requirements in the near future. Nonetheless, governing Supreme Court precedent provides that disclosure requirements generally receive lesser judicial scrutiny when they compel only commercial speech, as opposed to noncommercial speech. In National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra, a decision released in June 2018, the Supreme Court explained that it has applied a lower level of scrutiny to compelled disclosures under two circumstances. First, the Supreme Court has sometimes upheld laws that regulate commercial speech if the speech regulation is part of a larger regulatory scheme that is focused on conduct and only incidentally burdens speech. If a law is properly characterized as a regulation of conduct, rather than speech, then it may be subject to rational basis review, a deferential standard that asks only whether the regulation is a rational way to address the problem. However, it can be difficult to distinguish speech from conduct, and the Supreme Court has not frequently invoked this doctrine to uphold laws against First Amendment challenges. Second, the Supreme Court has sometimes applied a lower level of scrutiny to certain commercial disclosure requirements under the authority of a 1985 case, Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel. In Zauderer, the Court upheld a disclosure requirement after noting that the challenged provision compelled only \"factual and uncontroversial information about the terms under which . . . services will be available.\" The Court said that under the circumstances, the service provider's First Amendment rights were sufficiently protected because the disclosure requirement was \"reasonably related\" to the government's interest \"in preventing deception of consumers.\" Lower courts have generally interpreted Zauderer to mean that if a commercial disclosure provision requires only \"factual and uncontroversial information\" about the goods or services being offered, it should be analyzed under rational basis review. If a commercial disclosure requirement does not qualify for review under Zauderer, then it will most likely be analyzed under the intermediate standard that generally applies to government actions that regulate commercial speech. Some legal scholars have argued that recent Supreme Court case law suggests the Court may subject commercial disclosure provisions to stricter scrutiny in the future, either by limiting the factual circumstances under which these two doctrines apply or by creating express exceptions to these doctrines. If a court applies a heightened level of scrutiny, it may require the government to present more evidence of the problem it is seeking to remedy and stronger justifications for choosing a disclosure requirement to achieve its purposes."], "all_classes": null, "length": 9534}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is about the United States' involvement in Afghanistan's security and governance, specifically since 2001. The US has two missions: a counterterrorism mission they lead and the NATO-led Resolute Support mission, which they participate in with other coalition nations. The goal of Resolute Support is to create self-sustaining Afghan security ministries and forces that can maintain security in Afghanistan. The US is conducting these missions in a challenging security environment that has deteriorated since the January 2015 transition to Afghan-led security. The UN reported nearly 24,000 security incidents in Afghanistan in 2017, the most ever recorded, and despite a slight decrease in the overall number of security incidents in early 2018, the UN noted significant security challenges, including a spike in high-casualty attacks in urban areas and coordinated attacks by the insurgency on ANDSF checkpoints. The US contributes significantly to these missions, both in terms of personnel and funding. As of May 2018, the US was contributing 54% of Resolute Support military personnel. Of the approximately 14,000 US military personnel in Afghanistan as of June 2018, about 8,500 were assigned to Resolute Support to train, advise, and assist the ANDSF. For fiscal year 2018, Congress appropriated about $4.67 billion for the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund—the primary mechanism of U.S. financial support for manning, training, and equipping the ANDSF. Other international donors provided about $800 million, and the Afghan government committed to providing about $500 million, according to DOD reporting. The report also discusses the structure of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF), which includes the Afghan National Army (ANA) and the Afghan National Police (ANP). The ANA is divided into several components, including the ANA corps, Afghan Air Force, Special Mission Wing, ANA Special Operations Command, and Ktah Khas (counterterrorism forces). The ANP includes the Afghan Uniformed Police, Afghan Anti-Crime Police, Afghan Border Police, Public Security Police, Counter Narcotics Police of Afghanistan, and General Command of Police Special Units. The report highlights that while the ANDSF have improved", "answers": ["Developing independently capable ANDSF is a key component of U.S. and coalition efforts to create sustainable security and stability in Afghanistan under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)-led Resolute Support mission. The United States is the largest contributor of funding and personnel to Resolute Support, providing and maintaining ANDSF equipment, along with training, advising, and assistance to help the ANDSF effectively use and sustain the equipment in the future. House Report 114-537 included a provision for GAO to review the ANDSF's capability and capacity to operate and sustain U.S.-purchased weapon systems and equipment. This report addresses (1) what has been reported about ANDSF capabilities and capability gaps and (2) the extent to which DOD has information about the ANDSF's ability to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment. To conduct this work, GAO analyzed DOD and NATO reports and documents, examined three critical equipment types, and interviewed DOD officials in the United States and Afghanistan. This is a public version of a sensitive report issued in September 2018. Information that DOD deemed sensitive has been omitted. Since the Resolute Support mission began in 2015, the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) have improved some fundamental capabilities, such as high-level operational planning, but continue to rely on U.S. and coalition support to fill several key capability gaps, according to Department of Defense (DOD) reporting. DOD has initiatives to address some ANDSF capability gaps, such as a country-wide vehicle maintenance and training effort, but DOD reports it does not expect the ANDSF to develop and sustain independent capabilities in some areas, such as logistics, for several years. While DOD has firsthand information on the abilities of the Afghan Air Force and Special Security Forces to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment, it has little reliable information on the equipment proficiency of conventional ANDSF units. U.S. and coalition advisors are embedded at the tactical level for the Air Force and Special Security Forces, enabling DOD to directly assess those forces' abilities. However, the advisors have little direct contact with conventional ANDSF units on the front lines. As a result, DOD relies on those units' self-assessments of tactical abilities, which, according to DOD officials, can be unreliable. GAO's analysis of three critical equipment types illustrated the varying degrees of DOD's information (see figure above). For example, DOD provided detailed information about the Air Force's ability to operate and maintain MD-530 helicopters and the Special Security Forces' ability to operate and maintain Mobile Strike Force Vehicles; however, DOD had limited information about how conventional forces operate and maintain radios and Mobile Strike Force Vehicles. DOD's lack of reliable information on conventional forces' equipment operations and maintenance abilities adds to the uncertainty and risk in assessing the progress of DOD efforts in Afghanistan. GAO recommends that DOD develop options for collecting reliable information on conventional ANDSF units' ability to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment. DOD concurred with this recommendation."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4887}
{"pred": " The report discusses the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), which was enacted in 1974 and provides formula grants to states to improve child protective service systems. The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) administers the CAPTA state grant program and provides guidance and oversight to states. In fiscal year 2017, Congress provided about $25 million for the program. As part of the CAPTA state grant program, states are required to submit to the Secretary of HHS plans outlining how they intend to use CAPTA funds to improve their child protective service systems, among other things. State plans remain in effect for the duration of states’ participation in the grant program; if modifications are needed, these must be submitted. In addition to state plans, states are required to submit to HHS an annual data report providing information on agency decisions made in response to referrals of child abuse and neglect, as well as preventive services provided to families, among other things. CAPTA requires state governors to provide a series of assurances in their state plans. Since 2003, governors have had to provide an assurance that states have in effect and are enforcing a state law or program that includes policies and procedures to address the needs of infants affected by prenatal substance abuse or displaying withdrawal symptoms at birth. Under states’ policies and procedures, health care providers are required to notify CPS of such infants. Governors must also assure that a plan of safe care is developed for these infants. Although CAPTA does not define “plans of safe care,” for the purposes of this report we define them as plans to ensure the safety and well-being of infants who are born substance-affected. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 (CARA) amended certain provisions of CAPTA that relate to substance-affected infants (see table 1). In addition to provisions related to substance-affected infants, CAPTA also requires governors to provide an assurance to the Secretary of HHS that they have provisions or procedures for certain individuals to report known and suspected instances of child abuse and neglect, which are generally referred to as mandated reporter laws. All states have statutes identifying persons who are required to report suspected child maltreatment to an appropriate agency, such as child protective services, a law enforcement agency, or a state’s toll-free child abuse reporting hotline, according to a 2016 HHS report. Mandatory reporters often include social workers; teachers, principals, and other school personnel; physicians, nurses, and other health care workers; and", "answers": ["Under CAPTA, states perform a range of prevention activities, including addressing the needs of infants born with prenatal drug exposure. The number of children under the age of 1 entering foster care increased by about 15 percent from fiscal years 2012 through 2015. Child welfare professionals attribute the increase to the opioid epidemic. GAO was asked to examine the steps states are taking to implement CAPTA requirements on substance-affected infants and related amendments enacted in 2016. This report examines (1) the extent to which states have adopted policies and procedures to notify CPS of substance-affected infants; (2) state efforts to develop plans of safe care, and associated challenges; and (3) steps HHS has taken to help states implement the provisions. To obtain this information, GAO surveyed state CPS directors in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and reached a 100 percent response rate. GAO also visited 3 states (Kentucky, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania); reviewed relevant documents such as federal laws and regulations, and HHS guidance; and interviewed HHS officials. GAO did not assess states' compliance with CAPTA requirements. All states reported adopting, to varying degrees, policies and procedures regarding health care providers notifying child protective services (CPS) about infants affected by opioids or other substances. Under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), as amended, governors are required to provide assurances that the states have laws or programs that include policies and procedures to address the needs of infants affected by prenatal substance use. This is to include health care providers notifying CPS of substance-affected infants. In response to GAO's survey, 42 states reported having policies and procedures that require health care providers to notify CPS about substance-affected infants and 8 states reported having policies that encourage notification. The remaining 1 state has a policy requiring health care providers to assess the needs of mothers and infants and if they conclude that infants are at risk for abuse or neglect, CPS is notified. In response to GAO's survey, 49 states reported that their CPS agency has policies to develop a plan of safe care; 2 reported not having such a requirement. Under CAPTA, states are required to develop a plan of safe care for substance-affected infants. Although not defined in law, a plan of safe care generally entails an assessment of the family's situation and a plan for connecting families to appropriate services to stabilize the family and ensure the child's safety and well-being. States reported that plans typically address the infant's safety needs, immediate medical needs, and the caregiver's substance use treatment needs. However, officials in the 3 states GAO visited noted challenges, including uncertainty about what to include in plans and the level of intervention needed for infants at low risk of abuse or neglect. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has provided technical assistance and guidance to states to implement these CAPTA requirements. Most states reported in GAO's survey that additional guidance and assistance would be very or extremely helpful for addressing their challenges. Nevertheless, HHS officials told GAO that the agency does not anticipate issuing additional written guidance, but that states can access technical assistance through their regional offices and the National Center on Substance Abuse and Child Welfare—a resource center funded by HHS. However, of the 37 states that reported on the helpfulness of the assistance they have received, 19 said it was only moderately helpful to not helpful. States offered suggestions for improving the assistance, such as developing substance abuse training materials for staff and holding video conferences with other states to share information. In October 2017, HHS officials explained that some states have submitted plans that include details on how they are addressing the CAPTA requirements. HHS officials reported that some of the plans submitted to date indicated that states are not meeting the requirements and those states have been asked to develop program improvement plans. Without more specific guidance and assistance to enhance states' understanding of CAPTA requirements and better address known challenges such as the ones described in this report, states may miss an opportunity to provide more effective protections and services for the children and families most in need. GAO recommends that HHS provide additional guidance and technical assistance to states to address known challenges and enhance their understanding of requirements. HHS did not concur with the recommendation. As discussed in the report, GAO continues to believe that added guidance would benefit states."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8623}
{"pred": " The report examines the challenges faced by implementing partners of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Department of State (State) in accessing banking services for humanitarian assistance projects. It highlights the reliance on correspondent banking relationships for international financial transactions, including the transfer of U.S. humanitarian assistance funds. These transfers typically involve intermediary banks to move funds from U.S.-based accounts to accounts in recipient countries, where the funds are used by in-country staff to implement the project. The report notes that the number of correspondent banking relationships has declined over the past several years, especially for banks located in higher-risk jurisdictions (such as those subject to sanctions), have customers perceived as higher-risk, and who generate revenues insufficient to recover compliance costs. The decline in correspondent banking relationships could affect the ability to send and receive international payments and may drive some payment flows underground, with potential consequences on growth, financial inclusion, and the stability and integrity of the financial system. When performing overseas money transfers, U.S. banks and financial institutions must comply with the Bank Secrecy Act’s (BSA) anti-money laundering (AML) regulations and relevant regulations that implement U.S. sanctions. The BSA has established reporting, recordkeeping, and other AML requirements for financial institutions. BSA/AML regulations require that each bank tailor a compliance program that is specific to its own risks based on factors such as products and services offered, and customers and locations served. By complying with BSA/AML requirements, U.S. financial institutions assist government agencies in the detection and prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing. In addition to BSA regulations established by Treasury, federal banking regulators have issued their own BSA regulations. These regulations require banks to establish and maintain a BSA compliance program that, among other things, identifies and reports suspicious activity. The banking regulators are also required to review banks’ compliance with BSA/AML requirements and regulations, and they generally do so every 12 to 18 months as a part of their routine safety and soundness examinations. Among other things, examiners review whether banks have an adequate system of internal controls to ensure ongoing compliance with BSA/AML regulations. The federal banking regulators may take enforcement actions using their prudential authorities for violations of BSA/AML requirements. They may also assess civil money penalties against financial institutions and individuals. Banks must also comply with relevant regulations that implement U.S. sanctions in certain countries. When the United States imposes sanctions on an entity or individual, it freezes assets subject to U.S.", "answers": ["Since 2012, the United States has provided approximately $36 billion in humanitarian assistance to save lives and alleviate human suffering. Much of this assistance is provided in areas plagued by conflict or other issues that increase the risk of financial crimes. The World Bank and others have reported that humanitarian assistance organizations face challenges in accessing banking services that could affect project implementation. GAO was asked to review the possible effects of decreased banking access for nonprofit organizations on the delivery of U.S. humanitarian assistance. In this report, GAO examines (1) the extent to which State and USAID partners experienced banking access challenges, (2) USAID partners' reporting on such challenges, and (3) actions U.S. agencies have taken to help address such challenges. GAO selected four high-risk countries—Syria, Somalia, Haiti, and Kenya—based on factors such as their inclusion in multiple financial risk-related indices, and selected a non-generalizable sample of 18 projects in those countries. GAO reviewed documentation and interviewed U.S. officials and the 18 partners for the selected projects. Implementing partners (partners) for 7 of 18 Department of State (State) and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) humanitarian assistance projects that GAO selected noted encountering banking access challenges, such as delays or denials in transferring funds overseas. Of those 7 projects, 1 partner told us that banking access challenges adversely affected its project and 2 additional partners told us that the challenges had the potential for adverse effects. Moreover, the majority of partners (15 out of 18) for the 18 projects noted experiencing banking access challenges on their global portfolio of projects over the previous 5 years. USAID's partners' written reports do not capture potential risks posed by banking access challenges because USAID generally does not require most partners to report in writing any challenges that do not affect implementation. Six of the 7 projects that encountered challenges were USAID-funded. Of those 6 USAID projects, 5 partners told us that these challenges did not rise to the threshold of affecting project implementation that would necessitate reporting, and 1 did not report challenges although its project was adversely affected. Additionally, GAO's review of about 1,300 USAID partner reports found that the few instances where challenges were mentioned lacked sufficient detail for GAO to determine their type, severity, or origin. Without information on banking access challenges that pose potential risks to project implementation, USAID is not aware of the full extent of risks to achieving its objectives. The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and State have taken various actions to help address banking access challenges encountered by nonprofit organizations (NPO), but USAID's efforts have been limited. Treasury's efforts have focused on engagement between NPOs and U.S. agencies, while State has issued guidance on the topic to its embassies and designated an office to focus on these issues. In contrast, USAID lacks a comparable office, and NPOs stated that it is difficult to find USAID staff to engage with on this topic. Further, GAO found that awareness of specific challenges was generally limited to USAID staff directly overseeing the project. Without communicating these challenges to relevant parties, USAID may not be aware of all risks to agency objectives and may not be able to effectively engage with external entities on efforts to address these challenges. GAO recommends that USAID should take steps to (1) collect information on banking access challenges experienced by USAID's partners and (2) communicate that information both within USAID and with external entities, such as other U.S. agencies and partners.

{"pred": " The Department of Defense (DOD) has established the Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) to support military families with special needs, both at their current and proposed locations. The program is designed to ensure that these families receive the necessary services and support, including medical and educational services, during the relocation process. The EFMP has three components: identification and enrollment, assignment coordination, and family support. Identification and enrollment: Medical and educational personnel at each installation are responsible for identifying eligible family members with special medical or educational needs to enroll in the EFMP. Once identified by a qualified medical provider, active duty servicemembers are required to enroll in their service’s EFMP. Servicemembers are also required to self-identify when they learn a family member has a qualifying condition. Assignment coordination: Before finalizing a servicemember’s assignment to a new location, DOD requires each Military Service to consider any family member’s special needs during this process, including the availability of required medical and special educational services at a new location. Family support: DOD requires each Military Service’s EFMP to include a family support component through which it helps families with special needs identify and gain access to programs and services at their current, as well as proposed, locations. Servicemembers assigned to a joint base would receive family support from the Service that is responsible for leading that installation. For example, an Airman assigned to a joint base where the Army is the lead would receive family support from the Army installation’s EFMP. The Office of Special Needs (OSN) was established by the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2010 to develop, implement, and oversee a policy to support these families. Among other things, this policy must (1) address assignment coordination and family support services for families with special needs; (2) incorporate requirements for resources and staffing to ensure appropriate numbers of case managers are available to develop and maintain services plans that support these families; and (3) include requirements regarding the development and continuous updating of a services plan for each military family with special needs. OSN is also responsible for collaborating with the Services to standardize EFMP components as appropriate and for monitoring the Services’ EFMPs. OSN has been delegated the responsibility of implementing DOD’s policy for families with special needs by the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness through the Assistant Secretary for Manpower and Reserve Affairs according to DOD officials. Currently, OSN is administered under the direction of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Military Community", "answers": ["Military families with special medical and educational needs face unique challenges because of their frequent moves. To help assist these families, DOD provides services plans, which document the support a family member requires. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 included a provision for GAO to review the Services' EFMPs, including DOD's oversight of these programs. This report examines the extent to which (1) each Service provides family support and (2) the Services monitor and DOD evaluates assignment coordination and family support. GAO analyzed DOD and Service-specific EFMP guidance and documents; analyzed fiscal year 2016 EFMP data (the most recent available); visited seven military installations, selected for their large numbers of military-connected students; and interviewed officials responsible for implementing each Service's EFMP, as well as officials in OSN that administer DOD's EFM policy. The support provided to families with special needs through the Department of Defense's (DOD) Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) varies widely for each branch of Military Service. Federal law requires DOD's Office of Special Needs (OSN) to develop a uniform policy that includes requirements for (1) developing and updating a services plan for each family with special needs and (2) resources, such as staffing, to ensure an appropriate number of family support providers. OSN has developed such a policy, but DOD relies on each Service to determine its compliance with the policy. However, Army and Navy officials said they have not received feedback from OSN about the extent to which their Service-specific guidance complies. Federal internal control standards call for developing clear policies to achieve agency goals. In addition, DOD's most recent annual reports to Congress do not indicate the extent to which each Service provides services plans or allocates sufficient resources for family support providers. According to GAO's analysis, the Military Services have developed relatively few services plans, and there is wide variation in the number of family support providers employed, which raises questions about potential gaps in services for families with special needs (see table). Each Service uses various mechanisms to monitor how servicemembers are assigned to installations (assignment coordination) and obtain family support, but DOD has not established common performance measures to assess these activities. DOD has taken steps to better support families with special needs, according to the DOD officials GAO interviewed. For example, DOD established a working group to identify gaps in services. However, OSN officials said that DOD lacks common performance measures for assignment coordination and family support because the Services have not reached consensus on what those measures should be. In addition, OSN does not have a process to systematically evaluate the results of the Services' monitoring activities. Federal internal control standards call for assessing performance over time and evaluating the results of monitoring activities. Without establishing common performance measures and assessing monitoring activities, DOD will be unable to fully determine the effect of its efforts to better support families with special needs and the adequacy of the Services' EFMPs as required by federal law. GAO makes a total of three recommendations to DOD. DOD should assess and report to Congress on the extent to which each Service provides sufficient family support personnel and services plans, develop common performance metrics for assignment coordination and family support, and evaluate the results of the Services' monitoring activities.

{"pred": " The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a large, deployable infrared telescope designed to succeed the Hubble Space Telescope. It is intended to operate in a solar orbit approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth, with a 6.5-meter primary mirror, providing about 100 times the sensitivity of Hubble. The telescope's science instruments are designed to observe very faint infrared sources and therefore are required to operate at extremely cold temperatures. To help keep these instruments cold, a multi-layered tennis court-sized sunshield is being developed to protect the mirrors and instruments from the sun’s heat. The JWST project is divided into three major segments: the observatory segment, the ground segment, and the launch segment. When complete, the observatory segment of JWST is to include several elements (Optical Telescope Element (OTE), Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM), and spacecraft) and major subsystems (sunshield and cryocooler). The hardware configuration referred to as OTIS was created when the Optical Telescope Element and the Integrated Science Instrument Module were integrated. Additionally, JWST is dependent on software to deploy and control various components of the telescope, and to collect and transmit data back to Earth. The elements, major subsystems, and software are being developed through a mixture of NASA, contractor, and international partner efforts. The majority of work remaining is being carried out by two contractors: Northrop Grumman and the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy’s Space Telescope Science Institute. Northrop Grumman plays the largest role, developing the sunshield, the Optical Telescope Element, the spacecraft, and the Mid-Infrared Instrument’s cryocooler, in addition to integrating and testing the observatory. The Space Telescope Science Institute’s role includes soliciting and evaluating research proposals from the scientific community, and receiving and storing the scientific data collected, both of which are services that it currently provides for the Hubble Space Telescope.

The project has delayed its planned launch three times since September 2017 due to problems discovered in testing. In June 2018, NASA approved new cost and schedule estimates for JWST. Since the project established its cost and schedule baselines in 2009, the project's costs have increased by 95 percent and the launch date has been moved back by 81 months. Conference Report No. 112-284, accompanying the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012, included a provision for GAO to assess the project annually and report on its progress. This is the seventh report. This report assesses (1) the considerations NASA took into account when updating the project's cost and schedule commitments and (2) the extent to which NASA has taken steps to improve oversight and performance of JWST, among other issues. GAO reviewed relevant NASA policies, analyzed NASA and contractor data, and interviewed NASA and contractor officials. In June 2018, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) revised the cost and schedule commitments for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to reflect known technical challenges, as well as provide additional time to address unanticipated challenges. For example, the revised launch readiness date of March 2021 included 5.5 months to address a design issue for the cover of the sunshield (see image). The purpose of the sunshield is to protect the telescope's mirrors and instruments from the sun's heat. NASA found that hardware on the cover came loose during testing in April 2018. The new cost estimate of $9.7 billion is driven by the schedule extension, which requires keeping the contractor's workforce on board longer than expected. Before the project enters its final phase of integration and test, it must conduct a review to determine if it can launch within its cost and schedule commitments. As part of this review, the project is not required to update its joint cost and schedule confidence level analysis—an analysis that provides the probability the project can meet its cost and schedule commitments—but government and industry cost and schedule experts have found it is a best practice to do so. Such analysis would provide NASA officials with better information to support decisions on allocating resources, especially in light of the project's recent cost and schedule growth. NASA has taken steps to improve oversight and performance of JWST, and identified the JWST project manager as responsible for monitoring the continued implementation of these changes. Examples of recent changes include increasing on-site presence at the contractor facility and conducting comprehensive audits of design processes. Sustaining focus on these changes through launch will be important if schedule pressures arise later and because of past challenges with communications. GAO will follow up on the project's monitoring of these improvements in future reviews. GAO recommends NASA update the project's joint cost and schedule confidence level analysis.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this detailed report on child nutrition programs. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points.\n\nThe report starts by defining child nutrition programs as USDA-FNS programs providing food to children in institutional settings. It lists the main programs: NSLP, SBP, FFVP, SMP, and CACFP. The HHFKA was the last reauthorization, which expired in 2015 but the programs continued with annual appropriations. The 114th Congress started but didn't complete reauthorization, with both committees reporting legislation (S. 3136 and H.R. 5003) that died at the end of the Congress. The 115th Congress didn't have significant reauthorization efforts, but the 2018 farm bill included some provisions related to child nutrition programs. The report then goes into various issues related to these programs, such as nutritional content and sourcing, access to meals, implementation of the Community Eligibility Provision, and issues around unpaid meal costs and lunch shaming. Stakeholders include school food authorities, advocacy groups, and food industry organizations. The report also discusses legislative proposals in the 114th and 115th Congresses, such as the House version of the 2018 farm bill (H.R. 2) which would have allowed more flexibility in meal offerings, but this wasn't included in the final bill. There were also proposals to expand the Summer EBT program, which provides electronic benefits to eligible families for summer meals. The report mentions that the 2018 farm bill included some provisions related to child nutrition programs, but the main reauthorization efforts were not completed. The report also covers the changes in nutrition standards over time, including the removal of weekly limits on grains and protein, and the adjustments in milk, whole grain, and sodium requirements. It also discusses the Community Eligibility Provision's impact on meal access and the issues around unpaid meal costs and lunch shaming.

I need to highlight the main points: the different child nutrition programs, the HHFKA and its expiration, the reauthorization efforts in the 114th and 115th Congresses, the issues around food quality, sourcing, access, and lunch shaming. Also, mention the stakeholders involved and", "answers": ["The term child nutrition programs refers to several U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service (USDA-FNS) programs that provide food for children in institutional settings. These include the school meals programs—the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program—as well as the Child and Adult Care Food Program, Summer Food Service Program, Special Milk Program, and Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program. The most recent child nutrition reauthorization, the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA; P.L. 111-296), made a number of changes to the child nutrition programs. In some cases, these changes spurred debate during the law's implementation, particularly in regard to updated nutrition standards for school meals and snacks. On September 30, 2015, some of the authorities created by the HHFKA expired. Efforts to reauthorize the child nutrition programs in the 114th Congress, while not completed, considered several related issues and prompted further discussion about the programs. There were no substantial reauthorization attempts in the 115th Congress. Current issues discussed in this report include the following: Nutrition standards for school meals and snacks. The HHFKA required USDA to update the nutrition standards for school meals and other foods sold in schools. USDA issued final rules on these standards in 2012 and 2016, respectively. Some schools had difficulty implementing the nutrition standards, and USDA and Congress have taken actions to change certain parts of the standards related to whole grains, sodium, and milk. Offerings in the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP). There have been debates recently over whether the FFVP should include processed and preserved fruits and vegetables, including canned, dried, and frozen items. Currently, statute permits only fresh offerings. \"Buy American\" requirements for school meals. The school meals programs' authorizing laws require schools to source foods domestically, with some exceptions, under Buy American requirements. Efforts both to tighten and loosen these requirements have been made in recent years. The enacted 2018 farm bill (P.L. 115-334) instructed USDA to \"enforce full compliance\" with the Buy American requirements and report to Congress within 180 days of enactment. Congregate feeding in summer meals. Under current law, children must consume summer meals on-site. This is known as the \"congregate feeding\" requirement. Starting in 2010, Congress funded demonstration projects, including the Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) demonstration, to test alternatives to congregate feeding in summer meals. Congress has increased funding for Summer EBT in recent appropriations cycles and there have been discussions about whether to continue or expand the program. Implementation of the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP). The HHFKA created CEP, an option for qualifying schools, groups of schools, and school districts to offer free meals to all students. Because income-based applications for school meals are no longer required in schools adopting CEP, its implementation has created data issues for federal and state programs relying on free and reduced-price lunch eligibility data. Unpaid meal costs and \"lunch shaming.\" The issue of students not paying for meals and schools' handling of these situations has received increasing attention. Some schools have adopted what some term as \"lunch shaming\" practices, including throwing away a student's selected hot meal and providing a cold meal alternative when a student does not pay. Congress and USDA have taken actions recently to reduce instances of student nonpayment and stigmatization. Paid lunch pricing. One result of new requirements in the HHFKA was price increases for paid (full price) lunches in many schools. Attempts have been made—some successfully—to loosen these \"paid lunch equity\" requirements in recent years."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5157}
{"pred": " The Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund (CSPF) is a defined benefit multiemployer pension plan, primarily funded by employer contributions. These plans are typically found in industries with many small employers such as trucking, building and construction, and retail food sales. CSPF was established in 1955 to provide pension benefits to International Brotherhood of Teamsters union members in the trucking industry. The plan has faced significant financial challenges, including underfunding, employer withdrawals, and market downturns. CSPF was the subject of investigations by the IRS, DOL, and DOJ in the 1970s, leading to a consent decree in 1982. The decree established a framework for managing the plan's assets, with oversight by the court and the DOL. The plan's trustees are required to use an independent asset manager, known as the named fiduciary, to manage the plan's assets. The named fiduciary has exclusive authority to manage the plan's assets, subject to court approval. The named fiduciary is responsible for developing and implementing investment policy statements for the assets they manage, taking into account the plan's actuarial requirements. The report also discusses the financial challenges faced by many multiemployer pension plans, including CSPF, and the potential solutions to these challenges. The report concludes that CSPF is in a critical financial condition and that the potential solutions to these challenges are limited.

CSPF is one of the nation's largest multiemployer defined benefit pension plans, covering about 385,000 participants. Since 1982, the plan has operated under a court-enforceable consent decree which, among other things, requires that the plan's assets be managed by independent parties. Within 7 years, CSPF estimates that the plan's financial condition will require severe benefit cuts. GAO was asked to review the events and factors that led to the plan's critical financial status and how its investment outcomes compare to similar plans. GAO describes (1) what is known about the factors that contributed to CSPF's critical financial condition; (2) what has been CSPF's investment policy, and the process for setting and executing it, since the consent decree was established; and (3) how CSPF's investments have performed over time, particularly compared to similar pension plans. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations; interviewed CSPF representatives, International Brotherhood of Teamsters officials and members, federal officials, and knowledgeable industry stakeholders; reviewed CSPF documentation including investment policy statements and board of trustee meeting minutes; and analyzed investment returns and fees from required, annual pension plan filings and from consultant benchmarking reports. The Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund (CSPF) was established in 1955 to provide pension benefits to trucking industry workers, and is one of the largest multiemployer plans. According to its regulatory filings, CSPF had less than half the estimated funds needed to cover plan liabilities in 1982 at the time it entered into a court-enforceable consent decree that provides for oversight of certain plan activities. Since then, CSPF has made some progress toward achieving its targeted level of funding; however, CSPF has never been more than 75 percent funded and its funding level has weakened since 2002, as shown in the figure below. Stakeholders GAO interviewed identified numerous factors that contributed to CSPF's financial condition. For example, stakeholders stated that changes within the trucking industry as well as a decline in union membership contributed to CSPF's inability to maintain a healthy contribution base. CSPF's active participants made up about 69 percent of all participants in 1982, but accounted for only 16 percent in 2016. The most dramatic change in active participants occurred in 2007 when the United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) withdrew from the plan. At that time, UPS accounted for about 30 percent of the plan's active participants (i.e. workers). In addition, the market declines of 2001 to 2002 and 2008 had a significant negative impact on the plan's long-term investment performance. Stakeholders noted that while each individual factor contributed to CSPF's critical financial condition, the interrelated nature of the factors also had a cumulative effect on the plan's financial condition. Both CSPF's investment policy and the process for setting and executing it have changed several times since the consent decree was established in 1982. The original consent decree gave an independent asset manager—called a named fiduciary—exclusive authority to set and change the plan's investment policies and manage plan assets, and prohibited CSPF trustees from managing assets or making investment decisions. Initially, the named fiduciaries sold the troubled real estate assets acquired during the pre-consent decree era. Subsequent changes include the following: In 1993, the named fiduciaries started to increase investment in equities, and their policies continued to direct that asset allocations be weighted toward equities until early 2017. Between 2003 and 2010, the court approved three plan decisions to move a total of 50 percent of CSPF's assets into passively-managed accounts (passive management typically seeks to match the performance of a specific market index and reduce investment fees). An early-2017 investment policy change precipitated by CSPF's deteriorating financial condition will continue to move plan assets into fixed income investments ahead of projected insolvency, or the date when CSPF is expected to have insufficient assets to pay promised benefits when due. As a result, assets will be gradually transitioned from “return-seeking assets”—such as equities and emerging markets debt—to high-quality investment grade debt and U.S. Treasury securities with intermediate and short-term maturities. The plan is projected to become insolvent on January 1, 2025. CSPF officials and named fiduciary representatives said these changes are intended to reduce the plan's exposure to market risk and volatility, and provide participants greater certainty prior to projected insolvency. GAO found that CSPF's investment returns and expenses were generally in line with similarly sized institutional investors and with demographically similar multiemployer pension plans. For example, GAO's analysis of returns using the peer group measure used by CSPF known as the Wilshire Associates' Trust Universe Comparison Service (TUCS), showed that CSPF's annual investment returns since 1995 were above the median about as many times as they were below. Similarly, comparing CSPF's returns to a peer group of similar multiemployer defined benefit plans using federally required annual reports found that CSPF's annual investment returns were in line with those of its peers. Specifically, CSPF's annual returns were above the median nine times and below it six times—and CSPF's overall (dollar-weighted) average annual return from 2000 through 2014 was close to that of the peer median average return of 4.8 percent. In addition, GAO found that CSPF's investment fees and other administrative expenses have also been in line with other large multiemployer plans. For example: CSPF's investment fees as a percentage of assets were about 9 percent lower than the median of large defined benefit multiemployer plans over the 2000 through 2014 period—though much of that difference is accounted for by a relative reduction in investment fees since 2007. CSPF's investment fees as a percentage of assets were, on average, about 34 basis points (or 0.34 percent). CSPF's administrative expenses related to the day-to-day operations of the plan have also been in line with other large multiemployer plans. CSPF's administrative expenses per participant were below the median for large defined benefit multiemployer plans for 12 of the 15 years over the 2000 through 2014 period. As of 2014, CSPF's administrative expense was $98 per participant, which is about 16 percent less than the median for large defined benefit multiemployer plans.

{"pred": " The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 established the Choice Program, which allowed veterans to receive care from community providers when VA facilities could not provide timely or accessible care. The program was funded with up to $10 billion, and additional $9.4 billion was allocated through legislation in 2017 and 2018. The Choice Program will sunset on June 6, 2019. The program is administered by two TPAs—Health Net and TriWest—each responsible for managing networks of community providers in specific multi-state regions. The TPAs handle scheduling, payment, and processing of claims for eligible veterans. VA’s contracts with the TPAs do not include a payment timeliness requirement for the payments TPAs make to community providers. Instead, a contract modification effective in March 2016 established a non-enforceable “goal” of processing—approving, rejecting or denying—and, if approved, paying clean claims within 30 days of receipt. The Choice Program's authority will sunset on June 6, 2019. The VA MISSION Act of 2018 requires VA to consolidate its community care programs once the Choice Program sunsets, and to reimburse community providers in a timely manner. The report details the challenges faced by the Choice Program, including delays in payments to community providers, issues with provider education, and inadequate monitoring of contractual requirements. The report also discusses the steps taken by VA to improve payment timeliness, including the implementation of new systems and processes, and the development of future contracts for the Veterans Community Care Program. The report concludes with two recommendations for VA to address ongoing issues with the Choice Program and ensure timely reimbursement for community providers.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points. The main topic is the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014, which created the Choice Program. This program allowed veterans to get care from community providers when VA facilities couldn't provide timely or accessible care. The report mentions that the program was funded with up to $10 billion, and additional $9.4 billion was allocated through legislation in 2017 and 2018.

Each TPA managed networks of", "answers": ["Questions have been raised about the lack of timeliness of TPAs' payments to community providers under the Choice Program and how this may affect the willingness of providers to participate in the program as well as in the forthcoming Veterans Community Care Program. You asked GAO to review issues related to the timeliness of TPAs' payments to community providers under the Choice Program. This report examines, among other things, (1) the length of time TPAs have taken to pay community providers' claims and factors affecting timeliness of payments, and (2) actions taken by VA and the TPAs to reduce the length of time TPAs take to pay community providers for Choice Program claims. GAO reviewed TPA data on the length of time taken to pay community provider claims from November 2014 through June 2018, the most recent data available at the time of GAO's review. GAO also reviewed documentation, such as the contracts between VA and its TPAs, and interviewed VA and TPA officials. In addition, GAO interviewed a non-generalizable sample of 15 community providers, selected based on their large Choice Program claims volume, to learn about their experiences with payment timeliness. The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Choice Program (Choice Program) was created in 2014 to address problems with veterans' timely access to care at VA medical facilities. The Choice Program allows eligible veterans to obtain health care services from providers not directly employed by VA (community providers), who are then reimbursed for their services through one of the program's two third-party administrators (TPA). GAO's analysis of TPA data available for November 2014 through June 2018 shows that the length of time the TPAs took to pay community providers' clean claims each month varied widely—from 7 days to 68 days. VA and its TPAs identified several key factors affecting timeliness of payments to community providers under the Choice Program, including VA's untimely payments to TPAs, which in turn extended the length of time TPAs took to pay community providers' claims; and inadequate provider education on filing claims. VA has taken actions to address key factors that have contributed to the length of time TPAs have taken to pay community providers. For example, VA updated its payment system and related processes to pay TPAs more quickly. According to VA data, as of July 2018, VA was paying at least 90 percent of the TPAs' invoices within 7 days. In addition, VA and the TPAs have taken steps to improve provider education to help providers resolve claims processing issues. However, 9 of the 15 providers GAO interviewed said they continue to experience lengthy telephone hold times. According to VA and TPA officials, steps have been taken to improve the customer service offered to community providers. However, VA officials do not collect data on or monitor TPA compliance with customer service requirements—such as calls being answered within 30 seconds or less—for provider calls because they said they are not enforcing the requirements and are allowing TPAs to prioritize calls from veterans. Without collecting data and monitoring compliance, VA does not have information on challenges providers may face when contacting TPAs to resolve payment issues. GAO is making two recommendations, including that VA should collect data on and monitor compliance with its requirements pertaining to customer service for community providers. VA concurred with GAO's recommendations and described steps it will take to implement them."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5443}
{"pred": " The report provides an overview of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), its governance structure, and capital investment strategies. WMATA, established in 1967 through an interstate compact involving the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia, operates six rail lines—Red, Orange, Blue, Green, Yellow, and Silver—spanning 118 linear miles of guideway. The system includes 51 miles of subway, 58 miles at ground level, and 9 miles on aerial structures. WMATA's capital investments are funded through a combination of federal grants, state and local contributions, and long-term debt. From fiscal years 2011 through 2017, WMATA received about $5.8 billion in capital funding, with the federal government contributing $3.2 billion (over half) and state and local jurisdictions providing $2.4 billion (41 percent). WMATA also took on about $230 million in long-term debt to finance its capital program during this time period. The federal funding included grant awards, in addition to annual appropriations authorized under PRIIA. In 2008, PRIIA authorized $1.5 billion to WMATA, available in increments over 10 years beginning in fiscal year 2009, or until expended, for capital improvements and preventive maintenance. PRIIA funding and certain federal grants require state or local jurisdictions to provide matching funds. Additionally, a large portion of funding from state and local jurisdictions is governed by capital-funding agreements, which are periodically negotiated between WMATA and the states and localities. From fiscal years 2011 through 2017, state and local jurisdictions contributed on average about $340 million annually to WMATA, generally for capital purposes. The annual capital contributions from the jurisdictions are expected to more than double as a result of the recent legislation enacted by the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia in 2018. In addition, WMATA officials told us that it will have the ability to further leverage this dedicated funding and issue debt to finance its capital projects. The report also outlines WMATA's capital planning process, which includes developing the following: Capital Needs Inventory. WMATA periodically identifies its capital investment needs in this inventory. WMATA issued a Capital Needs Inventory in February 2010 and another in November 2016, each covering a 10-year period. According to WMATA, Capital Needs Inventories help inform the", "answers": ["Safety incidents in recent years on WMATA's rail system have raised questions about its processes for performing critical maintenance and replacing capital assets. WMATA initiated a new preventive maintenance program for its rail track in 2017, and is currently implementing a new capital planning process. GAO was asked to examine issues related to WMATA's capital funding and maintenance practices. This report examines: (1) how WMATA spent its capital funds from fiscal years 2011 through 2017, (2) how WMATA's new capital planning process addresses weaknesses it identified in the prior process, and (3) WMATA's progress toward its track preventive maintenance program's goals and how the program aligns with leading program management practices. GAO analyzed WMATA's financial and program information, interviewed officials of WMATA, the Federal Transit Administration, and five transit agencies selected for similarities to WMATA. GAO compared WMATA's capital planning process and track maintenance program with leading practices. From fiscal years 2011 through 2017, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) spent almost $6 billion on a variety of capital assets, with the largest share spent on improving its rail and bus fleet (see figure). Over this period, WMATA's capital spending was, on average, about $845 million annually. WMATA's new capital planning process could address some weaknesses it identified in the prior process. WMATA established a framework for quantitatively prioritizing capital needs (investments to a group of related assets) over a 10-year period. However, WMATA has not established documented policies and procedures for implementing the new process, such as those for selecting specific projects for funding in its annual capital budget. WMATA is currently using its new capital planning process to make fiscal year 2020 investment decisions. WMATA has proposed a fiscal year 2020 capital budget of $1.4 billion. Without documented policies and procedures for implementing the new planning process, WMATA's stakeholders do not have reasonable assurance that WMATA is following a sound process for making investment decisions. WMATA has made significant progress toward its track preventive maintenance program's goals, which are to reduce both track-defect and electrical-fire incidents by 50 percent in fiscal year 2019 compared with 2017. In fiscal year 2018, WMATA met its goal for reducing track defect incidents and reduced electrical fire incidents by 20 percent. However, in designing the program, WMATA did not fully assess risks. For example, WMATA did not quantitatively assess the impact of track defects or electrical fires on its ability to provide service, nor did it consider other risks such as non-electrical track fires, which represent about 30 percent of all fires on the system, or other factors, such as resources or track time. Without a comprehensive risk assessment, WMATA lacks reasonable assurance that the program is designed to address risks affecting the safety of the rail system or other risks that could hinder the new program's success. GAO is making five recommendations, including that WMATA establish documented policies and procedures for the new capital planning process and conduct a comprehensive risk assessment for the track preventive maintenance program. WMATA described actions planned or underway to address GAO's recommendations. GAO believes the recommendations should be fully implemented, as discussed in the report."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10886}
{"pred": " The World Trade Organization (WTO) is an international organization that administers the trade rules and agreements negotiated by its 164 members to eliminate trade barriers and create nondiscriminatory rules to govern trade. The United States was a major force behind the establishment of the WTO in 1995 and the rules and agreements that resulted from the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations (1986-1994). The WTO encompassed and expanded on the commitments and institutional functions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which was established in 1947 by the United States and 22 other nations. Through the GATT and WTO, the United States and other countries sought to establish a more open, rules-based trading system in the postwar era, with the goal of fostering international economic cooperation, stability, and prosperity worldwide. Today, the vast majority of world trade, approximately 98%, takes place among WTO members. The evolution of U.S. leadership in the WTO and the institution's future agenda have been of interest to Congress. The terms set by the WTO agreements govern the majority of U.S. trading relationships. Some 65% of U.S. global trade is with countries that do not have free trade agreements (FTAs) with the United States, including China, the European Union (EU), India, and Japan, and thus rely on the terms of WTO agreements. Congress has recognized the WTO as the \"foundation of the global trading system\" within U.S. trade legislation and plays a direct legislative and oversight role over WTO agreements. U.S. FTAs also build on core WTO agreements. While the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) represents the United States at the WTO, Congress holds constitutional authority over foreign commerce and establishes U.S. trade negotiating objectives and principles and implements U.S. trade agreements through legislation. U.S. priorities and objectives for the GATT/WTO are reflected in trade promotion authority (TPA) legislation since 1974. Congress also has oversight of the USTR and other executive branch agencies that participate in WTO meetings and enforce WTO commitments. The WTO's effectiveness as a negotiating body for broad-based trade liberalization has come under intensified scrutiny, as has its role in resolving trade disputes.

Congress has recognized the World Trade Organization (WTO) as the \"foundation of the global trading system\" within trade promotion authority (TPA) and plays a direct legislative and oversight role over WTO agreements. The statutory basis for U.S. WTO membership is the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (P.L. 103-465), and U.S. priorities and objectives for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)/WTO have been reflected in various TPA legislation since 1974. Congress also has oversight of the U.S. Trade Representative and other agencies that participate in WTO meetings and enforce WTO commitments.

Today, 98% of global trade is among WTO members. The WTO is a consensus and member-driven organization. Its core principles include nondiscrimination (most favored nation treatment and national treatment), freer trade, fair competition, transparency, and encouraging development. These are enshrined in a series of WTO trade agreements covering goods, agriculture, services, intellectual property rights, and trade facilitation, among other issues. Some countries, including China, have been motivated to join the WTO not just to expand access to foreign markets but to spur domestic economic reforms, help transition to market economies, and promote the rule of law. The WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) provides an enforceable means for members to resolve disputes over WTO commitments and obligations. The WTO has processed more than 500 disputes, and the United States has been an active user of the dispute settlement system. Supporters of the multilateral trading system consider the dispute settlement mechanism an important success of the system. At the same time, some members, including the United States, contend it has procedural shortcomings and has exceeded its mandate in deciding cases. Many observers are concerned that the effectiveness of the WTO has diminished since the collapse of the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations, which began in 2001, and believe the WTO needs to adopt reforms to continue its role as the foundation of the global trading system. To date, WTO members have been unable to reach consensus for a new comprehensive multilateral agreement on trade liberalization and rules. While global supply chains and technology have transformed international trade and investment, global trade rules have not kept up with the pace of change. Many countries have turned to negotiating free trade agreements (FTAs) outside the WTO as well as plurilateral agreements involving subsets of WTO members rather than all members. At the latest WTO Ministerial conference in December 2017, no major deliverables were announced. Several members committed to make progress on ongoing talks, such as fisheries subsidies and e-commerce, while other areas remain stalled. While many were disappointed by the limited progress, in the U.S. view, the outcome signaled that \"the impasse at the WTO was broken,\" paving the way for groups of like-minded countries to pursue new work in other key areas. Certain WTO members have begun to explore aspects of reform and future negotiations. Potential reforms concern the administration of the organization, its procedures and practices, and attempts to address the inability of WTO members to conclude new agreements. Proposed DS reforms also attempt to improve the working of the dispute settlement system, particularly the Appellate Body—the seven-member body that reviews appeals by WTO members of a panel's findings in a dispute case. Some U.S. frustrations with the WTO are not new and many are shared by other trading partners, such as the European Union. At the same time, the Administration's overall approach has spurred new questions regarding the future of U.S. leadership and U.S. priorities for improving the multilateral trading system. Concerns have emphasized that the Administration's recent actions to unilaterally raise tariffs under U.S. trade laws and to possibly impede the functioning of the dispute settlement system might undermine the credibility of the WTO system. A growing question of some observers is whether the WTO would flounder for lack of U.S. leadership, or whether other WTO members like the EU and China taking on larger roles would continue to make it a meaningful actor in the global trade environment. The growing debate over the role and future direction of the WTO may be of interest to Congress. Important issues it may address include how current and future WTO agreements affect the U.S. economy, the value of U.S. membership and leadership in the WTO, whether new U.S. negotiating objectives or oversight hearings are needed to address prospects for new WTO reforms and rulemaking, and the relevant authorities and impact of potential U.S. withdrawal from the WTO on U.S. economic and foreign policy interests."], "all_classes": null, "length": 21561}

The report is about improper payments in federal programs, right? It mentions IPIA, IPERA, and IPERIA, which are laws related to this issue. The agencies have to take certain steps to address improper payments, like conducting risk assessments, developing estimates, analyzing root causes, and reporting results. There's also mention of OMB guidance on developing these estimates, which are statistical in nature and allow flexibility. The report reviews 10 programs across different agencies, looking at their processes for estimating improper payments. Some agencies use alternative methodologies, like the Department of Education for Direct Loans after a cost-benefit analysis. Others, like the Department of Defense, use actual debts from overpayments. The Office of Personnel Management uses debts from overpayments for the Retirement program. The report also discusses the importance of testing processes, such as using a risk-based approach to address key risks like eligibility. OMB guidance states that when an agency's review is unable to determine whether a payment was proper due to insufficient documentation, the payment must be considered an improper payment. However, the treatment of nonresponse cases varied among the agencies, which could affect the accuracy of the estimates. Additionally, the IRS has not updated its methodology to include all improper payments, even those that may be recovered, leading to an understatement of the problem. The report concludes that while agencies have varying processes for estimating improper payments, some key risks like eligibility are not adequately addressed, which could impact the effectiveness of corrective actions. The report also highlights that without clearer guidance on how to handle these risks, the improper payment estimates may not be reliable. The report makes several recommendations to the Director of OMB and to the agencies involved, including developing guidance on how agencies test to identify improper payments and clarifying the treatment of nonresponse cases. The report also mentions that the IRS has not updated its methodology to include all improper payments, even those that may be recovered, which could lead to an understatement of the problem.

Estimation of improper payments is key to understanding the extent of the problem and to developing effective corrective actions. Relevant laws and guidance provide agencies flexibility in developing estimates. This report describes agencies' processes to estimate improper payments in selected programs for fiscal year 2017 and the extent to which certain differences in these processes can affect the usefulness of the resulting estimates. GAO selected 10 programs across six agencies with the largest reported program outlays in fiscal years 2015 and 2016.

The six agencies GAO reviewed reported taking various approaches related to key components of estimating improper payments—shown in the figure below—for 10 selected programs, which collectively reported outlays of over $2.5 trillion for fiscal year 2017. Sample selection. Eight of the 10 programs GAO reviewed reported using statistically valid approaches, and the remaining 2 reported using alternative methodologies approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The sampled data elements varied, including payments, medical claims, and tax returns. The age of the data used to develop fiscal year 2017 improper payment estimates also varied, ranging from calendar year 2013 to fiscal year 2017. Identification of improper payments. Some of the six agencies reported using processes designed specifically to estimate improper payments, whereas others reported leveraging existing reviews. These agencies' policies and procedures include a review of aspects of eligibility, except for those related to the Department of Defense's (DOD) Military Pay and the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Retirement overpayments. DOD and OPM have not fully assessed whether their estimation processes effectively consider key program risks. OMB guidance does not specifically address how agencies are to test to identify improper payments, such as using a risk-based approach to help ensure that key risks of improper payments are addressed. The six agencies also varied in the treatment of insufficient documentation, both in identifying and in reporting the root causes of improper payments. For the agencies that contact entities outside the agency to estimate improper payments, the treatment of nonresponse differed, with one agency including nonresponses as improper payments and another generally excluding the nonresponse cases from review. Although OMB guidance states that agencies should treat cases of insufficient documentation as improper payments, it does not specifically address the treatment of nonresponse cases. Calculation of the improper payment estimate. The six agencies generally reported using law and OMB guidance to calculate improper payment estimates for the selected programs, except for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) removed overpayments that were recovered when developing its estimate. OMB guidance requires agencies to include recovered amounts in their estimates. Removing these overpayments understates the EITC improper payment estimate and may limit IRS's ability to develop corrective actions to prevent improper payments. GAO recommends that OMB develop guidance on treatment of nonresponse cases and testing to identify improper payments, that DOD and OPM assess their estimation processes, and that IRS revise its methodology to not exclude recovered payments from its estimate. All of the agencies either agreed or partially agreed with the specific recommendations to them. GAO believes that the actions are warranted, as discussed in the report."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4147}
{"pred": " The report examines the Coast Guard's implementation of the Transition Assistance Program (TAP), focusing on data reliability and factors affecting participation. Key findings include:\n\n1. **TAP Implementation Structure**: The Coast Guard's TAP managers are stationed at 13 installations, each overseeing one or two managers per district. These managers oversee both their installation and units in the region, such as Coast Guard Base Cleveland, which manages operations across eight states and the Great Lakes area. The program manager in Coast Guard Headquarters oversees TAP for the Coast Guard.\n\n2. **TAP Participation Factors**: The most common factor affecting TAP participation, cited at 11 of 12 Coast Guard installations surveyed, pertained to servicemembers assigned to geographically remote locations. The next three most commonly cited factors—each cited by 7 of the 12 installations—related to the timing of participation: rapid separation from the military, not being sufficiently aware of the need to attend TAP, and starting the transition process too late to attend. Headquarters-based TAP officials identified additional factors that may affect participation, such as separating from the Coast Guard Reserves or retiring with no plans to work after leaving the military. However, the Coast Guard lacks participation data to verify whether participation rates for these groups are in fact lower than for other Coast Guard servicemembers.\n\n3. **TAP Data Collection System**: The Coast Guard's current data collection system is insufficient to ensure reliable data. For example, TAP staff enter TAP participation data into a shared spreadsheet that all TAP managers can edit. Specifically, staff record the names of servicemembers they identify as TAP-eligible and whether these individuals completed required portions of TAP. However, the data are updated on an ad-hoc basis, and may not be timely or complete. The report also notes that the Coast Guard lacks an up-to-date Commandant Instruction that specifies when to record TAP participation data, which is a major reason for the data being unreliable. Consequently, the data are updated on an ad-hoc basis, and may not be timely or complete. The report also mentions that the Coast Guard is in the process of adopting a new data system, in October 2018, to more reliably track TAP participation and that they expect to fully adopt this system—DOD’s TAP-IT Enterprise System—after a new Commandant Instruction is finalized, in May 2018.\n\n4. **TAP Participation Challenges**: Servicemembers assigned to remote locations face", "answers": ["Thousands of Coast Guard servicemembers have left the military and transitioned into civilian life, and some of these new veterans may face significant challenges, such as finding and maintaining employment. To help them prepare, federal law mandated that DHS provide separating Coast Guard servicemembers with counseling, employment assistance, and information on veterans' benefits through TAP. GAO was asked to examine TAP implementation. This review analyzes (1) the reliability of TAP data on participation levels for Coast Guard servicemembers and the factors that affect participation, and (2) the Coast Guard's performance measures and monitoring efforts related to TAP. GAO interviewed Coast Guard headquarters staff; surveyed 12 Coast Guard installations that conduct TAP (100 percent response rate); collected and reviewed participation data for reliability; and interviewed TAP managers from three installations selected for size and location, and 25 Coast Guard servicemembers at one location. (For a companion report on TAP implementation for separating and retiring servicemembers in other military services, see GAO-18-23 .) The United States Coast Guard (Coast Guard), which is overseen by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), lacks complete or reliable data on participation in the Transition Assistance Program (TAP), designed to assist servicemembers returning to civilian life. According to senior Coast Guard officials, a major reason why data are not reliable is the lack of an up-to-date Commandant Instruction that specifies when to record TAP participation data. Consequently, the data are updated on an ad-hoc basis and may not be timely or complete, according to officials. Federal internal control standards call for management to use quality information to achieve the entity's objectives. Until the Coast Guard issues an up-to-date Commandant Instruction that establishes policies and procedures to improve the reliability and completeness of TAP data, it will lack quality information to gauge the extent to which it is meeting TAP participation requirements in the VOW to Hire Heroes Act of 2011. According to GAO's survey of Coast Guard installations, various factors affected participation, such as servicemembers serving at geographically remote locations or separating from the Coast Guard rapidly. TAP officials and Coast Guard servicemembers GAO interviewed said commanders and direct supervisors sometimes pulled servicemembers out of TAP class or postponed participation because of mission priorities. TAP managers also said they rely on delivering TAP online because many Coast Guard servicemembers are stationed remotely. The Coast Guard cannot effectively measure performance to ensure key TAP requirements are met because it lacks reliable data and does not monitor compliance with several TAP requirements. Further, the Coast Guard has not established a formal performance goal against which it can measure progress, although federal internal control standards stipulate that management should consider external requirements—such as the laws with which the entity is required to comply—to clearly define objectives in specific and measurable terms. Establishing a goal could help the Coast Guard define expected performance. In addition, the Coast Guard does not monitor TAP requirements regarding the timeliness of servicemembers' TAP participation or their access to additional 2-day classes. Consequently, it cannot know whether servicemembers are starting TAP early enough to complete the program or those who elected to attend additional 2-day classes were able to do so before separation or retirement, as required by the Act. Finally, the Coast Guard lacks an up-to-date Commandant Instruction that establishes the roles and responsibilities of Coast Guard staff in implementing TAP. Federal internal control standards stipulate that management should assign responsibility and delegate authority to key roles throughout the entity. Issuing an up-to-date Commandant Instruction that defines roles and responsibilities would clarify who is ultimately responsible for ensuring Coast Guard servicemembers attend TAP, thereby facilitating accountability. GAO is making seven recommendations, including that the Coast Guard issue a new Commandant Instruction establishing data collection policies, set TAP performance goals, monitor timeliness and access, and define roles and responsibilities.

{"pred": " (One page, 500 words)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is from a government agency, probably the GAO (Government Accountability Office), and it discusses radiation exposure, health effects, and federal regulations.\n\nFirst, the report mentions the NRC's website stating that higher radiation doses lead to quicker effects and higher death probability. It talks about survivors of the atomic bombs in Japan experiencing cancers like leukemia and colon cancer, and acute radiation syndrome with symptoms ranging from nausea to death within days or weeks. In contrast, low-dose radiation effects are harder to detect, and below 100 mSv, the National Academies' 2006 report didn't definitively establish the cancer risk. The report also discusses how federal agencies like EPA, NRC, DOE, and FDA rely on scientific advisory bodies for radiation protection, using the linear no-threshold model, which assumes every incremental increase in radiation exposure raises cancer risk. The 2006 report suggested a proportionate relationship between low-dose radiation and cancer risk, and that new data strengthened confidence in these estimates. However, there are challenges in accurately estimating cancer risks from very low doses, especially when using the linear no-threshold model. For example, data from Japanese atomic bomb survivors, who received acute exposure, may not be directly applicable to U.S. populations with chronic low-dose exposure. Despite this, the NRC continues to follow the recommendations of scientific advisory bodies to use the linear no-threshold model, as there's no convincing evidence of a dose threshold below which low levels are beneficial or not harmful. Similarly, the EPA would consider changing the model only if there's a strong recommendation from scientific advisory bodies and an endorsement by the National Academies. The linear no-threshold model is used in federal regulations to set dose limits for radiation exposure, which are below the level the National Academies considers low dose. For example, the NRC's annual dose limit for the public from nuclear power plants is a hundredth of the level the National Academies considers low dose. The report also mentions that agencies have different limits based on the setting, like higher limits for workers but still below low dose. The ALARA principle is applied, meaning keeping exposures as low as reasonably achievable. The plant in the report set their own limit at 40% of the NRC's limit and used robots to reduce worker exposure. The FDA", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's September 2017 report, entitled Low-Dose Radiation: Interagency Collaboration on Planning Research Could Improve Information on Health Effects ( GAO-17-546 ). The Department of Energy (DOE), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Food and Drug Administration generally used the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public in the radiation exposure settings that GAO reviewed. These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas. GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research . Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.

{"pred": " The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) of 1977 was enacted to ensure that federally insured banks meet the credit needs of the communities in which they are chartered. The law was a response to concerns that banks were not providing sufficient credit to local areas, particularly low- and moderate-income (LMI) neighborhoods, and that they were using deposits from these areas to fund out-of-state and international lending activities. The CRA requires federal banking regulators to conduct examinations to assess whether a bank is meeting local credit needs. These examinations are based on the three tests: lending, investment, and service. The regulators issue CRA credits, or points, where banks engage in qualifying activities that occur within assessment areas. These credits are then used to issue each bank a performance rating from a four-tiered system of descriptive performance levels (Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve, or Substantial Noncompliance). The CRA applies to banking institutions with deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), such as national banks, savings associations, and state-chartered commercial and savings banks. The CRA does not apply to credit unions, insurance companies, securities companies, and other nonbank institutions because of the differences in their financial business models. The CRA's impact on lending activity has been publicly debated. Some observers are concerned that the CRA may induce banks to forgo more profitable lending opportunities in nontargeted neighborhoods by encouraging a disproportionate amount of lending in LMI communities. Furthermore, some argue that the CRA compels banks to make loans to higher-risk borrowers that are more likely to have repayment problems, which may subsequently compromise the financial stability of the banking system. For example, some researchers have attributed the increase in risky lending prior to the 2007-2009 recession to banks attempting to comply with CRA objectives. Others are concerned that enforcement of CRA objectives has not been stringent enough to compel banks to increase financial services in LMI areas. Almost all banks receive Satisfactory or better performance ratings on their CRA examinations, which some may consider indicative of weak enforcement. This report informs the congressional debate concerning the CRA's effectiveness in incentivizing bank lending and investment activity to LMI customers. It begins with a description of bank CRA examinations, including how a bank delineates its assessment area; the activities that may qualify for points under the three tests (i.e., lending, investment, and service) that collectively make up the CRA examination; and how the composite CRA rating is calculated. Next, the report analyzes the difficulty in attrib", "answers": ["The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA; P.L. 95-128, 12 U.S.C. §§2901-2908) addresses how banking institutions meet the credit needs of the areas they serve, particularly in low- and moderate-income (LMI) neighborhoods. The federal banking regulatory agencies—the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)—currently implement the CRA. The regulators issue CRA credits, or points, where banks engage in qualifying activities—such as mortgage, consumer, and business lending; community investments; and low-cost services that would benefit LMI areas and entities—that occur with a designated assessment area. These credits are then used to issue each bank a performance rating. The CRA requires these ratings be taken into account when banks apply for charters, branches, mergers, and acquisitions among other things. The CRA, which was enacted in 1977, was subsequently revised in 1989 to require public disclosure of bank CRA ratings to establish a four-tiered system of descriptive performance levels (i.e., Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve, or Substantial Noncompliance). In 1995, the CRA examination was customized to account for differences in bank sizes and business models. In 2005, the bank size definitions were revised and indexed to the Consumer Price Index. The 2005 amendments also expanded opportunities for banks to earn CRA credit for public welfare investments (such as providing housing, services, or jobs that primarily benefit LMI individuals). Qualifying activities under the CRA have evolved to include consumer and business lending, community investments, and low-cost services that would benefit LMI areas and entities. Congressional interest in the CRA stems from various perceptions of its effectiveness. Some have argued that, by encouraging lending in LMI neighborhoods, the CRA may also encourage the issuance of higher-risk loans to borrowers likely to have repayment problems (under the presumption that low-income is correlated with lower creditworthiness), which can translate into losses for lenders. Others are concerned that the CRA is not generating sufficient incentives to increase credit availability to qualified LMI borrowers, which may impede economic recovery for some, particularly following the 2007-2009 recession. This report informs the congressional debate concerning the CRA's effectiveness in incentivizing bank lending and investment activity to LMI borrowers. After a discussion of the CRA's origins, it presents the CRA's examination process and bank activities that are eligible for consideration of CRA credits. Next, it discusses the difficulty of determining the CRA's influence on bank behavior. For example, the CRA does not specify the quality and quantity of CRA-qualifying activities, meaning that compliance with the CRA does not require adherence to lending quotas or benchmarks. In the absence of benchmarks, determining the extent to which CRA incentives have influenced LMI credit availability relative to other factors is not straightforward. Banks also face a variety of financial incentives—for example, capital requirements, the prevailing interest rate environment, changes in tax laws, and technological innovations—that influence how much (or how little) they lend to LMI borrowers. Because multiple financial profit incentives and CRA incentives tend to exist simultaneously, it is difficult to determine the extent to which CRA incentives have influenced LMI credit availability relative to other factors."], "all_classes": null, "length": 7111}
{"pred": " The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is a large federal agency with a complex structure, comprising over 1,000 facilities and offices across the United States, its territories, and the Philippines. The VA is divided into three major administrations: the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA). The VHA is the largest in terms of workforce, with approximately 316,800 employees in 2017, followed by the VBA and NCA with about 22,700 and 1,850 employees, respectively. The remaining 15,000 employees are in various staff offices. The VA's budget request for fiscal year 2018 includes $82.1 billion in discretionary resources and $104.3 billion in mandatory funding. The report highlights the VA's structure for addressing misconduct, including the Office of Human Resource Management (OHRM), Office of Accountability Review (OAR), Office of Inspector General (OIG), Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection (OAWP), Corporate Senior Executive Management Office (CSEMO), and Client Services Response Team (CSRT). The report also discusses the process for addressing employee misconduct, including the receipt of allegations, review and referral of allegations, notice to the employee once allegations are substantiated, and disciplinary action. The report identifies several issues with the VA's information systems, including the lack of standardization, the lack of personnel identifiers, and the lack of complete data.

Misconduct by VA employees can have serious consequences for some veterans, including poor quality of care. GAO was asked to review employee misconduct across VA. This report reviews the extent to which VA (1) collects reliable information associated with employee misconduct and disciplinary actions, (2) adheres to documentation-retention procedures when adjudicating cases of employee misconduct, (3) ensures allegations of misconduct involving senior officials are reviewed according to VA investigative standards and these officials are held accountable, and (4) has procedures to investigate whistle-blower allegations of misconduct; and the extent to which (5) data and whistle-blower testimony indicate whether retaliation for disclosing misconduct occurs at VA. GAO analyzed 12 information systems across VA to assess the reliability of misconduct data, examined a stratified random sample of 544 misconduct cases from 2009 through 2015, analyzed data and reviewed cases pertaining to senior officials involved in misconduct, reviewed procedures pertaining to whistle-blower investigations, and examined a nongeneralizable sample of whistle-blower disclosures from 2010 to 2014. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) collects data related to employee misconduct and disciplinary actions, but fragmentation and data-reliability issues impede department-wide analysis of those data. VA maintains six information systems that include partial data related to employee misconduct. For example, VA's Personnel and Accounting Integrated Data system collects information on disciplinary actions that affect employee leave and pay, but the system does not collect information on other types of disciplinary actions. The system also does not collect information such as the offense or date of occurrence. GAO also identified six other information systems that various VA administrations and program offices use to collect specific information regarding their respective employees' misconduct and disciplinary actions. GAO's analysis of all 12 information systems found data-reliability issues—such as missing data, lack of identifiers, and lack of standardization among fields. Without collecting reliable misconduct and disciplinary action data on all cases department-wide, VA's reporting and decision making on misconduct are impaired. VA inconsistently adhered to its guidance for documentation retention when adjudicating misconduct allegations, based on GAO's review of a generalizable sample of 544 out of 23,622 misconduct case files associated with employee disciplinary actions affecting employee pay. GAO estimates that VA would not be able to account for approximately 1,800 case files. Further, GAO estimates that approximately 3,600 of the files did not contain required documentation that employees were adequately informed of their rights during adjudication procedures—such as their entitlement to be represented by an attorney. The absence of files and associated documentation suggests that individuals may not have always received fair and reasonable due process as allegations of misconduct were adjudicated. Nevertheless, VA's Office of Human Resource Management does not regularly assess the extent to which files and documentation are retained consistently with applicable requirements. VA did not consistently ensure that allegations of misconduct involving senior officials were reviewed according to investigative standards and these officials were held accountable. For example, based on a review of 23 cases of alleged misconduct by senior officials that the VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) referred to VA facility and program offices for additional investigation, GAO found VA frequently did not include sufficient documentation for its findings, or provide a timely response to the OIG. In addition, VA was unable to produce any documentation used to close 2 cases. Further, OIG policy does not require the OIG to verify the completeness of investigations, which would help ensure that facility and program offices had met the requirements for investigating allegations of misconduct. Regarding senior officials, VA did not always take necessary measures to ensure they were held accountable for substantiated misconduct. As the figure below shows, GAO found that the disciplinary action proposed was not taken for 5 of 17 senior officials with substantiated misconduct. As a result of June 2017 legislation, a new office within VA—the Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection—will be responsible for receiving and investigating allegations of misconduct involving senior officials. VA has procedures for investigating whistle-blower complaints, but the procedures allow the program office or facility where a whistle-blower has reported misconduct to conduct the investigation. According to the OIG, it has the option of investigating allegations of misconduct, or exercising a “right of first refusal” whereby it refers allegations of misconduct to the VA facility or program office where the allegation originated. VA does not have oversight measures to ensure that all referred allegations of misconduct are investigated by an entity outside the control of the facility or program office involved in the misconduct, to ensure independence. As a result, GAO found instances where managers investigated themselves for misconduct, presenting a conflict of interest. Data and whistle-blower testimony indicate that retaliation may have occurred at VA. As the table below shows, individuals who filed a disclosure of misconduct with the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) received disciplinary action at a much higher rate than the peer average for the rest of VA in fiscal years 2010–2014. Additionally, GAO's interviews with six VA whistle-blowers who claim to have been retaliated against provided anecdotal evidence that retaliation may be occurring. These whistle-blowers alleged that managers in their chain of command took several untraceable actions to retaliate against the whistle-blowers, such as being denied access to computer equipment necessary to complete assignments. GAO makes numerous recommendations to VA to help enhance its ability to address misconduct issues (several of the recommendations are detailed on the following page). GAO recommends, among other things, that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs develop and implement guidance to collect complete and reliable misconduct and disciplinary-action data department-wide; such guidance should include direction and procedures on addressing blank fields, lack of personnel identifiers, and standardization among fields; direct applicable facility and program offices to adhere to VA's policies regarding misconduct adjudication documentation; direct the Office of Human Resource Management to routinely assess the extent to which misconduct-related files and documents are retained consistently with applicable requirements; direct the Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection (OAWP) to review responses submitted by facility or program offices to ensure evidence produced in senior-official case referrals demonstrates that the required elements have been addressed; direct OAWP to issue written guidance on how OAWP will verify whether appropriate disciplinary action has been implemented; and develop procedures to ensure (1) whistle-blower investigations are reviewed by an official independent of and at least one level above the individual involved in the allegation, and (2) VA employees who report wrongdoing are treated fairly and protected against retaliation. GAO also recommends, among other things, that the VA OIG revise its policy and require verification of evidence produced in senior-official case referrals.

Some regulators seek to protect and benefit the public at large through regulation, while others seek to achieve the same goals through the promotion of market efficiency. Additionally, Congress granted the FCC wide latitude and flexibility to revise its interpretation of the public interest standard to reflect changing circumstances and the agency has not defined it in more concrete terms. These circumstances, paired with changes in FCC leadership, have led to significant changes over time in how the FCC regulates the broadcast and telecommunications industries. The FCC is directed by five commissioners appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for five-year terms. The President designates one of the commissioners as chairperson.

These powers come from the Constitution or statutory law. Some are always available, while others are standby and only activate when a national emergency is declared. Congress can modify or rescind these authorities. \n\nThe report mentions that before World War I, Presidents used emergency powers at their discretion, often through proclamations.

In 1976, Congress passed the National Emergencies Act, which curtailed the use of such proclamations. \n\nThe report also talks about historical figures like John Locke, who influenced the Founding Fathers. Locke argued that the executive could have broad discretion in emergencies, even if not in wartime. He believed that the public good could be advanced by such actions. \n\nThe report goes into the history of emergency powers, starting with the Continental Congress during the Revolutionary War. Then, the Constitutional Convention in 1787, where emergency powers weren't a major topic. However, the Constitution's Article I, Section 8, and other clauses imply emergency powers. \n\nThere's a discussion about the different views of presidential power, like the \"stewardship\" theory (Theodore Roosevelt) versus a more limited view (William Howard Taft). The report also mentions that the extent of emergency powers is influenced by the President's interpretation of their office. \n\nThe report then talks about specific laws that grant emergency powers, such as the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970 and the Defense Production Act. These laws are either continuously available or require a declaration of a national emergency to activate them. \n\nThe National Emergencies Act of 1976 established procedures for declaring a national emergency, including how long it remains in effect and the process for congressional oversight. The act also introduced accountability measures for the President's use of emergency powers. \n\nThe report also discusses the concept of a national emergency, which is characterized by suddenness, urgency, and the need for immediate action. It can be a public calamity, such as a natural disaster, or other conditions that threaten life and well-being. \n\nThe report includes historical examples, such as the ", "answers": ["The President of the United States has available certain powers that may be exercised in the event that the nation is threatened by crisis, exigency, or emergency circumstances (other than natural disasters, war, or near-war situations). Such powers may be stated explicitly or implied by the Constitution, assumed by the Chief Executive to be permissible constitutionally, or inferred from or specified by statute. Through legislation, Congress has made a great many delegations of authority in this regard over the past 230 years. There are, however, limits and restraints upon the President in his exercise of emergency powers. With the exception of the habeas corpus clause, the Constitution makes no allowance for the suspension of any of its provisions during a national emergency. Disputes over the constitutionality or legality of the exercise of emergency powers are judicially reviewable. Both the judiciary and Congress, as co-equal branches, can restrain the executive regarding emergency powers. So can public opinion. Since 1976, the President has been subject to certain procedural formalities in utilizing some statutorily delegated emergency authority. The National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. §§1601-1651) eliminated or modified some statutory grants of emergency authority, required the President to formally declare the existence of a national emergency and to specify what statutory authority activated by the declaration would be used, and provided Congress a means to countermand the President's declaration and the activated authority being sought. The development of this regulatory statute and subsequent declarations of national emergency are reviewed in this report."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4981}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about USPS's competitive products. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points.\n\nThe report starts by mentioning that USPS has a wide range of competitive products, which are a growing sector. The volume increased from 750 million in 2008 to 4.9 billion in 2017. Revenue from these products went from 10% to 28% of USPS mail revenues. The report also notes that e-commerce growth is expected to increase the volume of competitive products, especially for last-mile delivery. USPS has seen revenue from these products exceed expectations by $500 million in 2017 due to e-commerce and marketing efforts. However, they expect increased competition in first- and last-mile delivery services. To stay competitive, USPS uses scanning data to provide real-time visibility and accurate delivery time estimates. They also optimize their network, including processing facilities and post offices, to reduce costs. \n\nThe report then goes into the structure of USPS, divided into seven postal areas with 67 postal districts. Each level has managers responsible for overseeing the level below. For example, district managers are accountable to area vice presidents, and postmasters are accountable to district managers. \n\nScanning is a key part of tracking competitive products. USPS uses automation and scanning devices to capture barcode information. When items can't go through all automated scans, employees manually scan barcodes. These barcodes link the item with information in USPS databases, such as delivery address, product type, and when the item was accepted. \n\nThe report mentions that USPS has a scanning process with up to 13 scans to track the movement of competitive products. The first scan is when the item is accepted, and the last scan is when it's delivered. The interim scans reflect the item's progress through the postal network. \n\nUSPS uses devices like the Mobile Delivery Device (MDD) and Intelligent Mail Device (IMD) for scanning. MDDs have GPS and transmit data via cellular network. IMDs are used in facilities without GPS. \n\nThe report states that USPS has a high scanning rate, but some missed or inaccurate scans do occur. These can affect millions of products. Examples include missed scans due to improper procedures or supervisors not adequately monitoring. \n\nThe report also discusses that USPS has not based its operational policies and procedures on any internal control standards. They don't follow the COSO Framework or the Federal Government's", "answers": ["USPS's competitive products have become increasingly important, comprising about 28 percent of USPS's total revenue. USPS scans these packages at various points throughout the postal network. When scans are inaccurate or missing, questions are raised about the veracity of USPS's data on scanning performance and can lead to customer complaints. GAO was asked to review USPS's scanning policies and procedures. In this report, GAO (1) describes USPS's scanning performance and (2) examines how USPS ensures accurate scanning. GAO reviewed USPS's policies and procedures and assessed them against internal control standards; interviewed officials from USPS and five high-volume mailers; and conducted site visits to six post offices in two USPS districts that represented a range of volume, number of routes, and performance. Mail products over which the United States Postal Service (USPS) does not exercise market dominance, such as many of its packages, are called competitive products. These items are scanned throughout the mail delivery system to track their progress (see figure). USPS data show that these products are almost always scanned. For example, USPS data showed that for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2018; all but one of USPS's 67 districts met their scanning goals. Additionally, mailers that account for a high volume of USPS's competitive products told GAO that they believed USPS was generally scanning products correctly. However, a small percentage of missed or inaccurate scans occur. For example, a report from one USPS district showed that for one week, 0.73 percent of the products delivered were missing a scan and that for the fiscal year to date almost 155,000 competitive products were missing a delivery scan. USPS has designed and implemented procedures and activities to help ensure accurate scanning, but some limitations could contribute to scanning errors. For example, USPS has not based its operational procedures for scanning on any internal control standards. USPS officials said the procedures were based on USPS's unique responsibilities, management experience, and sound business practices, but the officials could not identify specific standards or a framework that they followed as the basis for the procedures. USPS officials said they did not believe any internal controls standards applied to these procedures. By not basing procedures on standards, USPS may miss opportunities to improve how it achieves its mission to scan and measure the performance of competitive products. Additionally, USPS's scanning procedure documents, such as for outlining specific delivery scanning steps, are not always consistent, and USPS relies on more informal methods, such as meetings with employees to communicate changes. Thus, employees may not have accurate procedures available to them. Finally, USPS lacks procedures to help managers identify and address incorrect scans, address customer complaints or otherwise address scanning irregularities. For example, USPS's guidance for managers is limited to a list of bullet-points that do not detail the steps managers should follow to resolve scanning irregularities. In addition, this list has not been updated since 2005. Without consistent or detailed procedures, USPS's employees and managers may not scan items accurately or find information needed to resolve scanning issues—a situation that could hinder USPS's ability to reduce inaccurate or missing scans for these important mail products. GAO recommends that USPS: (1) identify and adopt internal control standards for its operational activities such as for scanning of competitive products; (2) improve the communication of procedures for scanning competitive products; and, (3) create procedures for supervisors on how to address inaccurate scans and resolve scanning issues. USPS agreed to explore addressing the first recommendation and agreed with the other two recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5486}

The report is about NASA's mission, their major projects, the life cycle of these projects, and specific challenges faced by projects like WFIRST, TESS, and JWST. \n\nFirst, the report mentions that NASA's mission involves advancing science, technology, aeronautics, and space exploration, contributing to education, innovation, the economy, and Earth stewardship. They have various projects, including space telescopes, which are complex and require significant resources. \n\nThe report explains the life cycle of NASA's space flight projects, divided into phases A through F. Each phase has key decision points where projects must get approval before proceeding. The report also talks about the Joint Cost and Schedule Confidence Level (JCL) initiative, which is a point-in-time estimate that includes all cost and schedule elements, incorporates and quantifies known risks, assesses the impacts of cost and schedule to date, and addresses available annual resources. NASA policy requires that projects be baselined and budgeted at the 70 percent confidence level. \n\nThen there's a discussion of the three major space telescope projects: WFIRST, TESS, and JWST. Each has different phases, costs, and challenges. For example, JWST has had significant cost increases and schedule delays, leading to a revised launch date. The report also mentions that NASA has taken steps to improve program management, including better cost and schedule estimating, adequate reserves, and enhanced oversight of contractors. \n\nI need to condense all this into a concise summary. Let me start by outlining the key sections: NASA's mission, the life cycle of projects, the JCL initiative, the status of the three telescopes, challenges faced, and lessons learned. \n\nI should mention the phases A-F, the key decision points like project confirmation (decision point C), the JCL process, the 70% confidence level, cost and schedule reserves. Then, for each telescope: WFIRST's cost and schedule issues, TESS's challenges with launch date and contractor issues, JWST's technical and management problems leading to delays and cost overruns. \n\nAlso, the report highlights that NASA has implemented some of the lessons learned, such as improving cost and schedule estimating, providing adequate reserves, better oversight, and using earned value management.

Three space telescope projects are the key enablers for NASA to achieve its astrophysics' science goals, which include seeking to understand the universe. In its fiscal year 2018 budget request, NASA asked for about $697 million for these three projects, which represents over 50 percent of NASA's budget for its astrophysics' major projects. In total, these projects represent an expected investment of at least $12.4 billion. This statement reflects preliminary observations on (1) the current status and cost of NASA's major telescope projects and (2) lessons learned that can be applied to NASA's management of its telescope projects. This statement is based on ongoing work on JWST and ongoing work on the status of NASA's major projects. Both reports are planned to be published in Spring 2018. This statement is also based on past GAO reports on JWST and NASA's acquisitions of major projects, and NASA input. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) current portfolio of major space telescopes includes three projects that vary in cost, complexity, and phase of the acquisition life cycle. GAO's ongoing work indicates that these projects are each making progress in line with their phase of the acquisition cycle but also face some challenges. For example, the current launch date for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) project reflects a 57-60-month delay from the project's original schedule. GAO's preliminary observations indicate this project still has significant integration and testing to complete, with very little schedule reserve remaining to account for delays. Therefore, additional delays beyond the delay of up to 8 months recently announced are likely, and funding available under the $8 billion Congressional cost cap for formulation and development may be inadequate. There are a number of lessons learned from its acquisitions that NASA could consider to increase the likelihood of successful outcomes for its telescope projects, as well as for its larger portfolio of projects, such as its human spaceflight projects. For example, twice in the history of the JWST program, independent reviews found that the program was not holding adequate cost and schedule reserves. GAO has found that NASA has not applied this lesson learned to all of its large projects, and similar outcomes to JWST have started to emerge. For example, NASA did not incorporate this lesson with its human spaceflight programs. In July 2016 and April 2017, GAO found that these programs were holding inadequate levels of cost and schedule reserves to cover unexpected cost increases or delays. In April 2017, GAO recommended that NASA reassess the date of the programs' first test flight. NASA concurred and, in November 2017, announced a launch delay of up to 19 months. GAO is not making any recommendations in this statement, but has made recommendations in prior reports to strengthen NASA's acquisition management of its major projects.

The SBA's guarantee currently ranges from 80% to 90% of the surety's loss if a default occurs. In FY2018, the SBA guaranteed 10,800 bid and final surety bonds with a total contract value of nearly $6.5 billion. The program's guarantee rate was increased from not to exceed 70% to not to exceed 90% of losses in P.L. 114-92, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. The SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Program has been operational since April 1971. It is designed to increase small business' access to federal, state, and local government contracting, as well as private-sector contracting, by guaranteeing bid, performance, payment, and specified ancillary bonds \"on contracts … for small and emerging contractors who cannot obtain bonding through regular commercial channels.\" The program guarantees individual contracts of up to $6.5 million, and up to $10 million if a federal contracting officer certifies that such a guarantee is necessary.

Although the surety industry does not report the total value of the bonds it issues each year, estimates based on the total amount of premiums collected by the private sector in recent years suggest that the SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Program represents, by design, a relatively small percentage of the market for surety bonds (from about 1.1% to 6.7% of the value of surety bonds issued by the private sector).

A surety bond is a three-party instrument between a surety (who agrees to be responsible for the debt or obligation of another), a contractor, and a project owner. The agreement binds the contractor to comply with the contract's terms and conditions. If the contractor is unable to successfully perform the contract, the surety assumes the contractor's responsibilities and ensures that the project is completed. Surety bonds encourage project owners to contract with small businesses that may not have the credit history or prior experience of larger businesses and may be at greater risk of failing to comply with the contract's terms and conditions. Surety bonds are important to small businesses interested in competing for federal contracts because the federal government requires prime contractors—prior to the award of a federal contract exceeding $150,000 for the construction, alteration, or repair of any building or public work of the United States—to furnish a performance bond issued by a surety satisfactory to the contracting officer in an amount that the officer considers adequate to protect the government.

Advocates of raising the program's bond limit argued that doing so would increase contracting opportunities for small businesses and bring the limit more in line with limits of other small business programs, such as the 8(a) Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development Program and the Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Program. Opponents argued that raising the limit could lead to higher amounts being guaranteed by the SBA and, as a result, increase the risk of program losses.

The LDA requires lobbyists to register with the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House and to file quarterly reports disclosing their respective lobbying activities. Lobbyists are required to file their registrations and reports electronically with the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House through a single entry point. Registrations and reports must be publicly available in downloadable, searchable databases from the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House. No specific statutory requirements exist for lobbyists to generate or maintain documentation in support of the information disclosed in the reports they file. However, guidance issued by the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House recommends that lobbyists retain copies of their filings and documentation supporting reported income and expenses for at least 6 years after they file their reports. The LDA requires that the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House guide and assist lobbyists with the registration and reporting requirements and develop common standards, rules, and procedures for LDA compliance. The guidance is reviewed semiannually. The last revision was January 31, 2017, to update the registration threshold based on the Consumer Price Index and clarify the identification of clients and covered officials and issues related to rounding income and expenses. The guidance provides definitions of LDA terms, elaborates on registration and reporting requirements, includes specific examples of different scenarios, and provides explanations of why certain scenarios prompt or do not prompt disclosure under the LDA. The offices of the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House told us they continue to consider information we report on lobbying disclosure compliance when they periodically update the guidance. In addition, they told us they e-mail registered lobbyists quarterly on common compliance issues and reminders to file reports by the due dates. The LDA defines a lobbyist as an individual who is employed or retained by a client for compensation, who has made more than one lobbying contact (written or oral communication to covered officials, such as a high ranking agency official or a Member of Congress made on behalf of a client), and whose lobbying activities represent at least 20 percent of the time that he or she spends on behalf of the client during the quarter. Lobbying firms are persons or entities that have one or more employees who lobby on behalf of a client other than that person or entity.

The law also includes a provision for GAO to annually audit lobbyists' compliance with the LDA. GAO's objectives were to (1) determine the extent to which lobbyists can demonstrate compliance with disclosure requirements, (2) identify challenges to compliance that lobbyists report, and (3) describe the resources and authorities available to USAO in its role in enforcing LDA compliance, and the efforts USAO has made to improve enforcement. This is GAO's 11th report under the provision. GAO reviewed a stratified random sample of 98 quarterly disclosure LD-2 reports filed for the third and fourth quarters of calendar year 2016 and the first and second quarters of calendar year 2017. GAO also reviewed two random samples totaling 160 LD-203 reports from year-end 2016 and midyear 2017. This methodology allowed GAO to generalize to the population of 45,818 disclosure reports with $5,000 or more in lobbying activity, and 30,594 reports of federal political campaign contributions. GAO also met with officials from USAO to obtain status updates on its efforts to focus resources on lobbyists who fail to comply. GAO is not making any recommendations in this report. GAO provided a draft of this report to the Department of Justice for review and comment. The Department of Justice provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. For the 2017 reporting period, most lobbyists provided documentation for key elements of their disclosure reports to demonstrate compliance with the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, as amended (LDA). For lobbying disclosure (LD-2) reports and political contributions (LD-203) reports filed during the third and fourth quarter of 2016 and the first and second quarter of 2017, GAO estimates that 87 percent of lobbyists filed reports as required for the quarter in which they first registered; the figure below describes the filing process and enforcement; 99 percent of all lobbyists who filed (up from 83 percent in 2016) could provide documentation for income and expenses; and 93 percent filed year-end 2016 LD-203 reports as required. These findings are generally consistent with prior reports GAO issued for the 2010 through 2016 reporting periods. However, in recent years GAO's findings showed some variation in the estimated percentage of reports with supporting documentation. For example, an estimated increase in lobbyists who could document expenses is notable in 2017 and represents a statistically significant increase from 2016. As in GAO's other reports, some lobbyists were still unclear about the need to disclose certain previously held covered positions, such as paid congressional internships or certain executive agency positions. GAO estimates that 15 percent of all LD-2 reports may not have properly disclosed previously held covered positions. On the other hand, over the past several years of reporting on lobbying disclosure, GAO found that most lobbyists in the sample rated the terms associated with LD-2 reporting as “very easy” or “somewhat easy” to understand.

The report examines the SBA's appropriations over time, focusing on developments and trends since FY2000. It also provides total available funding and, for comparative purposes, actual and anticipated expenditures for the SBA's entrepreneurial development noncredit programs. The report highlights the significant variation in SBA appropriations since FY2000, with fluctuations in disaster assistance, business loan credit subsidies, and other programs. The variation in disaster assistance is primarily due to supplemental appropriations for major hurricanes. The variation in business loan credit subsidies is mainly due to the impact of changing economic conditions on the SBA's loan portfolios. During good economic times, revenue from fees and collateral liquidation is typically sufficient to cover the SBA's cost of purchasing defaulted loans. During and immediately following economic slowdowns, however, revenue from fees and collateral liquidation is typically insufficient to cover the SBA's cost of purchasing defaulted loans. The shortfall occurs because the SBA's cost of purchasing defaulted loans tends to increase when the economy slows (primarily because guaranteed loans are more likely to default during and immediately following recessions) and revenue from loan liquidation tends to be constrained during slow economic times (primarily because commercial real estate values typically fall during and immediately following recessions). As a result, additional appropriations are needed to cover these expenses, which are guaranteed by the \"full faith and credit of the United States.\" The report also discusses the SBA's other programs, including salaries and expenses, business loan administration, the Office of Inspector General (OIG), the Office of Advocacy (Advocacy), and entrepreneurial development (ED) noncredit programs.

{"pred": " The report discusses the financial status of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund (Trust Fund) and explores potential solutions to address its growing debt. The Trust Fund provides both cash assistance and medical benefits to miners with black lung disease, with monthly cash payments ranging from $650 to $1,300 in fiscal year 2017, depending on the number of dependents. Medical benefits cover hospital and nursing care, rehabilitation services, and drug and equipment charges, with an average annual cost of about $6,980 per miner. In fiscal year 2017, there were about 25,700 beneficiaries, including dependents, receiving black lung benefits. The decline in beneficiaries is attributed to decreasing coal mining employment and an aging beneficiary population. However, the number of beneficiaries could increase in the near term due to the increased occurrence of black lung disease and its most severe form, progressive massive fibrosis, particularly among Appalachian coal miners. The Trust Fund is funded by a coal tax, which is imposed at two rates depending on whether the coal is extracted from underground or surface mines. The current tax rates are $1.10 per ton of underground-mined coal and $0.55 per ton of surface-mined coal, up to 4.4 percent of the sales price. This means that if a ton of underground-mined coal is sold for less than $25, the tax paid would be less than $1.10. For instance, if a ton of underground-mined coal sold for $20, the tax would be 4.4 percent of the sales price, or $0.88. The Trust Fund's revenue is primarily obtained from mine operators through the coal tax, which is collected by the Treasury's Internal Revenue Service and then transferred to the Trust Fund. The Trust Fund's expenditures include black lung benefit payments, certain administrative costs incurred by DOL and Treasury to administer the black lung benefits program, and debt repayments. When necessary for the Trust Fund to make relevant expenditures under federal law, the Trust Fund borrows from the Treasury’s general fund. This borrowing is essentially from the general taxpayer. The Trust Fund has faced financial challenges since its establishment about 40 years ago, with expenditures consistently exceeding revenue, interest payments growing, and legislative actions not fully addressing its debt. The Trust Fund's borrowing will likely continue to increase from fiscal years 2019 through 2050 due, in part, to the scheduled coal tax rate", "answers": ["With revenue of about $450 million in fiscal year 2017, the Trust Fund paid about $184 million in benefits to more than 25,000 coal miners and eligible dependents. However, the Trust Fund also borrowed about $1.3 billion from the Treasury's general fund in fiscal year 2017 to cover its debt repayment expenditures. Adding to this financial challenge, the coal tax that supports the Trust Fund is scheduled to decrease by about 55 percent beginning in 2019. GAO was asked to review the financial positon of the Trust Fund and identify options to improve it. This report examines (1) factors that have challenged the financial position of the Trust Fund since its inception and (2) the extent to which Trust Fund debt may change through 2050, and selected options that could improve its future financial position. GAO reviewed Trust Fund financial data from fiscal years 1979 through 2017. GAO also interviewed officials from the Departments of Labor, Treasury, Health and Human Services (HHS) and representatives of coal industry and union groups. Using assumptions, such as the about 55 percent coal tax decrease and moderately declining coal production, GAO simulated the extent to which Trust Fund debt may change through 2050. GAO also simulated how selected options, such as forgiveness of debt, could improve finances. The options simulated are not intended to be exhaustive. Further, GAO is not endorsing any particular option or combination of options. GAO provided a draft of this report to DOL, Treasury, and HHS. The agencies provided technical comments, which were incorporated as appropriate. Multiple factors have challenged Black Lung Disability Trust Fund (Trust Fund) finances since it was established about 40 years ago. Its expenditures have consistently exceeded its revenues, interest payments have grown, and actions taken that were expected to improve Trust Fund finances did not completely address its debt. When necessary to make expenditures, the Trust Fund borrows with interest from the Department of the Treasury's (Treasury) general fund. Because Trust Fund expenditures have consistently exceeded revenue, it has borrowed almost every year since 1979, its first complete fiscal year, and as a result debt and interest payments increased. Legislative actions were taken over the years including (1) raising the rate of the coal tax that provides Trust Fund revenues and (2) forgiving debt. For example, the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 provided an appropriation toward Trust Fund debt forgiveness; about $6.5 billion was forgiven, according to Department of Labor (DOL) data (see figure). However, coal tax revenues were less than expected due, in part, to the 2008 recession and increased competition from other energy sources, according to DOL and Treasury officials. As a result, the Trust Fund continued to borrow from Treasury's general fund from fiscal years 2010 through 2017 to cover debt repayment expenditures. GAO's simulation suggests that Trust Fund borrowing will likely increase from fiscal years 2019 through 2050 due, in part, to the coal tax rate decrease of about 55 percent that will take effect in 2019 and declining coal production. The simulation estimates that Trust Fund borrowing may exceed $15 billion by 2050 (see figure). However, various options, such as adjusting the coal tax and forgiving interest or debt, could reduce future borrowing and improve the Trust Fund's financial position. For example, maintaining the current coal tax rates and forgiving debt of $2.4 billion could, under certain circumstances, balance the Trust Fund by 2050, whereby revenue would be sufficient to cover expenditures. However, a coal industry representative said that maintaining or increasing the coal tax would burden the coal industry, particularly at a time when coal production has been declining. Further, Treasury officials noted that the costs associated with forgiving Trust Fund interest or debt would be paid by taxpayers."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5783}
{"pred": " \n\nThe report examines how selected federal agencies assess and dispose of personal property, with a focus on how space reduction efforts have affected these processes. Personal property includes common items like computers and office equipment, as well as specialized equipment such as scientific devices and heavy machinery. Some items require special handling, such as hazardous materials, animals, and firearms. Federal agencies are required by law to maintain adequate inventory controls and accountability systems for property under their control, continually survey property to identify excess, promptly report excess property to GSA, and dispose of it in accordance with GSA regulations. Agencies are also required to use existing agency property or obtain excess property from other federal agencies before purchasing new property. The General Services Administration (GSA) assists agencies when they no longer need personal property and has established a government-wide personal property disposal process in federal regulation. The process generally begins when an agency declares a personal property item as \"excess\"—that is, the agency determines it no longer needs the item to carry out its mission. Agencies are to make this determination only after ensuring the property is not needed elsewhere within the agency. Once property is declared excess, there are four potential disposal methods: transfer to another federal agency or certain non-federal entities, donation, sale, and abandonment or destruction. Federal agencies and some non-federal entities have the priority to acquire excess property through transfer. If none of these eligible entities have requested the property for transfer after 21 days, the property becomes \"surplus\"—that is, GSA determines that federal agencies no longer need the item to carry out their missions. Surplus property may be donated to eligible entities through a State Agency for Surplus Property, representing the state of the prospective donee. Property not donated within 5 days after the close of the 21-day screening period may be sold to the general public and, finally, unsold property may be abandoned or destroyed. The report also highlights that while agencies have policies for managing accountable property, they generally do not have policies or processes for identifying unneeded property. This lack of systematic approach can lead to idle property that could be reused within the agency or the federal government, resulting in potential cost savings. The report found that agencies generally do not track or inventory low-value items due to high costs and manpower requirements, or because they believe they are not required by law to do so. While agencies are required to have systems of accounting and internal controls that provide effective control over, and accountability for, their assets, they have latitude in how they implement these procedures, including which", "answers": ["The federal government owns billions of dollars of personal property—such as office furniture, scientific equipment, and industrial machinery. By law, each agency is required to follow GSA's disposal process so that an agency's unneeded property can be used by other agencies or certain non-federal entities. Since 2012, agencies have reduced their office and warehouse space due to government-wide initiatives, a reduction that in turn has required agencies to dispose of some affected personal property. GAO was asked to review how federal agencies identify and dispose of unneeded personal property. This report examines (1) how selected agencies assess whether personal property is needed and (2) how these agencies dispose of unneeded property and how, if at all, space reduction efforts have affected disposals. GAO reviewed federal statutes and regulations, and selected five agencies—EPA, Forest Service, GSA, HUD, and IRS—mainly based on space reduction results and goals. GAO reviewed these agencies' property disposal data for 2012 through 2016 and interviewed headquarters and field staff about their property management and disposal processes. The five agencies GAO reviewed—the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Forest Service, General Services Administration (GSA), Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and Internal Revenue Service (IRS)—generally do not have policies or processes for identifying unneeded personal property, such as office furniture, on a proactive basis. Instead, officials from these agencies said they typically identified unneeded property as a result of a “triggering event,” such as an office space reduction. Executive agencies are required by law to continuously review property under their control to identify unneeded personal property and then dispose of it promptly. Without such policies or processes, agencies may not be routinely identifying unneeded property that could be used elsewhere, and efforts to maximize federal personal property use and minimize unnecessary storage costs may not be effective. GSA has issued regulations establishing a government-wide disposal process for unneeded personal property. However, according to GSA officials, the agency lacks the authority to promulgate regulations or formal guidance on management of in-use agency property, and there is no government-wide guidance to agencies on identifying unneeded personal property. Agencies are required to have internal control activities—such as policies and procedures—for reasonable assurance of efficient operations and minimal resource waste, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides guidance to agencies on implementing such activities. Guidance from OMB that emphasizes agencies' internal control responsibilities could help ensure that agencies are proactively and regularly identifying property that is no longer needed. The selected agencies reported little difficulty in following GSA's personal property disposal process, reporting over 37,000 items as unneeded property in fiscal years 2012 through 2016. This property was disposed of through transfers to other agencies, donations to authorized recipients, sales, or discarding. When disposing of personal property from space reduction projects at locations GAO visited, agencies also reported using GSA's process (see figure). Overall, agencies said they have not experienced major challenges with disposing of personal property from space reduction efforts. This lack of challenges could be because projects are geographically dispersed and spread over several years. OMB should provide guidance to executive agencies on managing their personal property, emphasizing that agencies' policies or processes should reflect the requirement to continuously review and identify unneeded personal property.

The Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) sets the standards for internal auditing, which are mandatory for the organizations to follow. The report highlights that the strategic goals of the four inter-American organizations are predominantly aligned with the high-level strategic goals for the Western Hemisphere documented by the U.S. agencies. However, the U.S. agencies did not consistently include all key monitoring provisions in their assistance agreements with these organizations. The report also found that the agencies had partial documentation of the required monitoring activities for the agreements reviewed.

The agencies risk weakening the effectiveness of these controls by not including all key monitoring provisions called for by applicable agency guidance. Additionally, if the agencies do not have full documentation of the agreements’ required monitoring activities, they may not have the information needed to make appropriate budgetary and programmatic decisions.

GAO analyzed documents and interviewed officials from State, USAID, HHS, USDA, and the organizations. GAO also analyzed a nongeneralizable sample of 12 of the 60 assistance agreements that were awarded by State, USAID, HHS, and USDA to OAS, PAHO, and IICA and were active during calendar years 2014 through 2016. For each agency, GAO selected three agreements with the lowest, median, and highest dollar value. GAO found that strategic goals of the Organization of American States (OAS), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA), and the Pan-American Institute of Geography and History (PAIGH) are predominantly aligned with the strategic goals of the Department of State (State), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). For example, IICA's strategic goals of a productive agricultural sector, enhancing agricultural development, and food security are aligned with USDA's foreign assistance goals. State, USAID, HHS, and USDA fund activities in the form of assistance agreements (e.g., grants and cooperative agreements) with OAS, PAHO, and IICA, which in 2016 totaled $32 million. According to agency officials, the agencies employ mechanisms to ensure that these agreements align with U.S. strategic goals. OAS, PAHO, IICA, and PAIGH have established mechanisms for overseeing their use of funds, such as external auditors, internal audit boards, and anti-fraud and ethics policies. State and USDA have directly supported these mechanisms. For example, State engaged in the selection process for OAS's Inspector General. GAO's review of 12 selected assistance agreements found that USDA included no financial or performance monitoring provisions in one of its agreements and that State did not include two key monitoring provisions in one of its agreements, called for by applicable guidance.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is about the rise of e-commerce and its impact on the market for counterfeit goods. \n\nFirst, the report mentions that counterfeit goods are shifting from secondary markets like flea markets to primary markets such as e-commerce sites, corporate supply chains, and traditional retail stores. This shift is important because in secondary markets, consumers are often aware they're buying counterfeits, whereas in primary markets, counterfeiters try to deceive consumers into thinking the goods are authentic. \n\nThe report also talks about how counterfeiters have changed their methods. In the past, consumers could identify counterfeits by looking at the price, appearance, or location. Now, they use third-party marketplaces to look legitimate, post pictures of real goods, and create fake reviews. They also set prices close to genuine goods to trick consumers into thinking they're getting a deal. \n\nThen there's data from CBP and ICE showing an increase in counterfeit goods seized, with a significant portion coming from China and Hong Kong. The variety of products has expanded beyond luxury items to almost every industry. The methods of importing counterfeit goods have changed, with express carriers and international mail becoming the main forms of transportation, making up about 90% of IPR seizures in recent years. \n\nThe report also includes a study where they purchased samples of four types of consumer products from third-party sellers on five e-commerce websites. They found that 20 out of 47 items were counterfeit. The counterfeit items varied in how they were identified, with some being easy to spot and others requiring more expertise. \n\nThere are health risks associated with counterfeit goods, such as counterfeit phone chargers failing safety tests and counterfeit cosmetics containing harmful substances. \n\nThe private sector, including rights holders and e-commerce websites, is taking steps to protect IPR. They have teams that work with law enforcement, and they block counterfeit items. However, there are challenges, such as the sophistication of counterfeit goods making it hard for law enforcement to distinguish between real and fake. Also, the expansion of counterfeit goods requires CBP officials to have in-depth knowledge of a broad range of products and how to identify counterfeits. \n\nCounterfeiters may break up large shipments into smaller ones to avoid seizures, which poses challenges for CBP and ICE because processing time and resources are the same regardless of shipment size. \n\nThe report also mentions that CBP and ICE", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's January 2018 report, entitled Intellectual Property: Agencies Can Improve Efforts to Address Risks Posed by Changing Counterfeits Market , ( GAO-18-216 ). Changes in the market for counterfeit goods entering the United States pose new challenges for consumers, the private sector, and U.S. agencies that enforce intellectual property rights (IPR). Specifically, growth in e-commerce has contributed to a shift in the sale of counterfeit goods in the United States, with consumers increasingly purchasing goods online and counterfeiters producing a wider variety of goods that may be sold on websites alongside authentic products. For example, 20 of 47 items GAO purchased from third-party sellers on popular consumer websites were counterfeit, according to testing by the products' rights holders (see table), highlighting potential risks to consumers. The changes in the market for counterfeit goods can also pose challenges to the private sector—for example, the challenge of distinguishing counterfeit from authentic goods listed for sale online—and complicate the enforcement efforts of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). CBP and ICE engage in a number of activities to enhance IPR enforcement; however, while ICE has assessed some of its efforts, CBP has taken limited steps to do so. CBP's and ICE's IPR enforcement activities broadly include detecting imports of potentially IPR-infringing goods, conducting special operations at U.S. ports, engaging with international partners, and undertaking localized pilot programs or port-led initiatives. CBP and ICE have collected some performance data for each of the eight activities GAO reviewed, and ICE has taken some steps to understand the impact of its efforts. However, CBP has conducted limited evaluation of its efforts to enhance IPR enforcement. Consequently, CBP may lack information needed to ensure it is investing its resources in the most efficient and effective activities. CBP and ICE generally collaborate on IPR enforcement, but according to private sector representatives, restrictions on CBP's information sharing limit private sector enforcement efforts. GAO found that CBP and ICE have undertaken efforts that align with selected key practices for interagency collaboration, such as participating in developing a national IPR enforcement strategy and agreeing on roles and responsibilities. However, sharing additional information about seized items with rights-holding companies and e-commerce websites could improve enforcement, according to private sector representatives. CBP officials said they share information to the extent allowed under current regulations, but CBP has not completed an assessment of what, if any, additional information would be beneficial to share with private sector entities.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this TANF report. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points. \n\nThe report is about the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant. It answers frequently asked questions and provides data. There's an appendix with state-level tables. The report doesn't cover TANF program rules, which are discussed in another CRS report. \n\nThe President signed legislation (P.L. 116-4) on January 24, 2019, funding TANF and related programs through June 30, 2019. This allows states to receive their quarterly TANF grants for the second quarter (January-March) and third quarter (April-June) of FY2019. However, additional legislation would be needed to pay TANF grants in the final quarter (July-September) of FY2019. \n\nTANF is funded by both federal and state funds. In FY2018, the federal block grant was $16.5 billion for the 50 states, DC, Puerto Rico, Guam, Virgin Islands, and American Indian tribes. There's also a contingency fund for states meeting certain conditions. Additionally, states must spend a minimum amount of their own funds (MOE) under the maintenance of effort requirement. The MOE is $10.3 billion per year for the 50 states, DC, and territories. \n\nTANF was created in 1996 with the PRWORA law. The block grant amount was set at $16.6 billion in 1996 and remained the same until FY2017. However, this amount was not adjusted for inflation, leading to a significant decline in real value. By FY2017, the real value had declined by one-third. Then, in FY2017, the block grant was reduced by 0.33% to finance TANF-related research and technical assistance. The reduced block grant amount is $16.5 billion. \n\nThe report includes data on the use of TANF funds, such as basic assistance, child care, work-related activities, tax credits, child welfare, and prekindergarten programs. It also mentions the flexibility in using TANF funds, such as reserving unused funds for unexpected events. \n\nThe report discusses", "answers": ["The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant funds a wide range of benefits and services for low-income families with children. TANF was created in the 1996 welfare reform law (P.L. 104-193). This report responds to some frequently asked questions about TANF; it does not describe TANF rules (see, instead, CRS Report RL32748, The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Block Grant: A Primer on TANF Financing and Federal Requirements, by Gene Falk). TANF Funding and Expenditures. TANF provides fixed funding for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the territories, and American Indian tribes. The basic block grant totals $16.5 billion per year. States are also required in total to contribute, from their own funds, at least $10.3 billion annually under a maintenance-of-effort (MOE) requirement. Though TANF is best known for funding cash assistance payments for needy families with children, the block grant and MOE funds are used for a wide variety of benefits and activities. In FY2017, expenditures on basic assistance totaled $7.1 billion—23% of total federal TANF and MOE dollars. Basic assistance is often—but not exclusively—paid as cash. In addition to funding basic assistance, TANF also contributes funds for child care and services for children who have been, or are at risk of being, abused and neglected. Some states also count expenditures in prekindergarten programs toward the MOE requirement. The TANF Assistance Caseload. A total of 1.2 million families, composed of 3.1 million recipients, received TANF- or MOE-funded assistance in September 2018. The bulk of the \"recipients\" were children—2.3 million in that month. The assistance caseload is heterogeneous. The type of family once thought of as the \"typical\" assistance family—one with an unemployed adult recipient—accounted for 32% of all families on the rolls in FY2016. Additionally, 31% of cash assistance families had an employed adult, while 38% of all TANF families were \"child-only\" and had no adult recipient. Child-only families include those with disabled adults receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI), adults who are nonparents (e.g., grandparents, aunts, uncles) caring for children, and families consisting of citizen children and ineligible noncitizen parents. Cash Assistance Benefits. TANF cash benefit amounts are set by states. In July 2017, the maximum monthly benefit for a family of three ranged from $1,021 in New Hampshire to $170 in Mississippi. Only New Hampshire (at 60% of the federal poverty guidelines) had a maximum TANF cash assistance amount for this sized family in excess of 50% of poverty-level income. Work Requirements. TANF's main federal work requirement is actually a performance measure that applies to the states. States determine the work rules that apply to individual recipients. TANF law requires states to engage 50% of all families and 90% of two-parent families with work-eligible individuals in work activities, though these standards can be reduced by \"credits.\" Therefore, the effective standards states face are often less than the 50% or 90% targets, and vary by state. In FY2017, states achieved, on average, an all-family participation rate of 53.0% and a two-parent rate of 69.5%. In FY2017, two jurisdictions did not meet the all-family participation standard: Nevada and Guam. This is a reduction from FY2012, when 16 states did not meet that standard. In FY2017, nine jurisdictions did not meet the two-parent standard. States that do not meet work standards are at risk of being penalized by a reduction in their block grant."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3000}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is about Medicare's payment rates for laboratory tests, specifically changes made after the implementation of PAMA in 2018.\n\nFirst, the report explains that before PAMA, Medicare paid for individual tests using the CLFS, which had rates based on 1984-1985 adjusted for inflation. There were also 57 geographic jurisdictions with their own fee schedules. CMS used these to calculate a national limitation amount, which was the maximum payment for individual tests. So the payment rate was the lesser of the amount claimed by the lab, the local fee for the area, or the national limitation amount for the test.\n\nThen there's information about panel tests, which are groups of tests. These can be divided into two categories: those without billing codes and those with billing codes. Panel tests without billing codes are composed of at least 2 of 23 distinct component tests. There are 7 specific combinations of these 23 component tests that are commonly used and have their own billing code. Before 2018, Medicare paid for both types of panel tests using a bundled rate based on the number of tests performed, with modest payment increases for each additional test. For example, in 2017, Medicare paid $7.15 for panel tests with two component tests and $9.12 for panel tests with three component tests, with a maximum bundled payment rate of $16.64 for all 23 component tests. Prior to 2018, the Medicare Administrative Contractors would count the number of tests performed before determining the appropriate bundled payment rate. For those panel tests with a billing code, the payment rate was the same if laboratories used the associated billing code for the panel test or listed each of the component tests separately.\n\nAfter PAMA's implementation in 2018, the 57 separate fee schedules for individual laboratory tests were replaced with a single national fee schedule. The payment rates for this single national fee schedule were based on private-payer rates for laboratory tests paid from January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016. Specifically, the payment rate for an individual test was generally based on the median private-payer rates for a given test, weighted by test volume. Payment for panel tests also changed in 201", "answers": ["Medicare paid $7.1 billion for 433 million laboratory tests in 2017. These tests help health care providers prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases. PAMA included a provision for GAO to review CMS's implementation of new payment rates for these tests. This report addresses, among other objectives, (1) how CMS developed the new payment rates; (2) challenges CMS faced in setting accurate payment rates and what factors may have mitigated these challenges; and (3) the potential effect of the new payment rates on Medicare expenditures. GAO analyzed 2016 Medicare claims data (the most recent data available when GAO started its work and the year on which new payment rates were based) and private-payer data CMS collected. GAO also interviewed CMS and industry officials. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) revised the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS) for 2018, establishing new Medicare payment rates for laboratory services. Prior to 2018, these rates were based on historical laboratory fees and were typically higher than the rates paid by private payers. The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA) required CMS to develop a national fee schedule for laboratory tests based on private-payer data. To revise the rates, CMS collected data on private-payer rates from approximately 2,000 laboratories and calculated median payment rates, weighted by volume. GAO found that the median private-payer rates were lower than Medicare's maximum payment rates in 2017 for 88 percent of tests. CMS is gradually phasing in reductions to Medicare payment rates, limited annually at 10 percent over a 3-year period (2018 through 2020), as outlined in PAMA. CMS relied on laboratories to determine whether they met data reporting requirements, but agency officials told GAO that CMS did not receive data from all laboratories required to report. CMS did not estimate the amount of data it should have received from laboratories that were required to report but did not. CMS took steps to exclude inaccurate private-payer data and estimated how collecting certain types and amounts of additional private-payer data could affect Medicare expenditures. However, it is not known whether CMS's estimates reflect the actual risk of incomplete data resulting in inaccurate Medicare payment rates. GAO found that PAMA's phased in reductions to new Medicare payment rates likely mitigated this risk of inaccurate Medicare payment rates from 2018 through 2020. However, GAO found that collecting incomplete data could have a larger effect on the accuracy of Medicare payment rates in future years when PAMA allows for greater payment-rate reductions. CMS's implementation of the new payment rates could lead Medicare to pay billions of dollars more than is necessary and result in CLFS expenditures increasing from what Medicare paid prior to 2018 for two reasons. First, CMS used the maximum Medicare payment rates in 2017 as a baseline to start the phase in of payment-rate reductions instead of using actual Medicare payment rates. This resulted in excess payments for some laboratory tests and, in some cases, higher payment rates than those Medicare previously paid, on average. GAO estimated that Medicare expenditures from 2018 through 2020 may be $733 million more than if CMS had phased in payment-rate reductions based on the average payment rates in 2016. Second, CMS stopped paying a bundled payment rate for certain panel tests (groups of laboratory tests generally performed together), as was its practice prior to 2018, because CMS had not yet clarified its authority to do so under PAMA, according to officials. CMS is currently reviewing whether it has the authority to bundle payment rates for panel tests to reflect the efficiency of conducting a group of tests. GAO estimated that if the payment rate for each panel test were unbundled, Medicare expenditures could increase by as much as $10.3 billion from 2018 through 2020 compared to estimated Medicare expenditures using lower bundled payment rates for panel tests. GAO recommends that the Administrator of CMS (1) collect complete private-payer data from all laboratories required to report or address the estimated effects of incomplete data, (2) phase in payment-rate reductions that start from the actual payment rates rather than the maximum payment rates Medicare paid prior to 2018, and (3) use bundled rates for panel tests. HHS concurred with GAO's first recommendation, neither agreed nor disagreed with the other two, and has since issued guidance to help address the third. GAO believes CMS should fully address these recommendations to prevent Medicare from paying more than is necessary."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6322}

Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points.\n\nThe report discusses the role of banks in the U.S. economy, their functions like lending, and the three categories of bank regulations: safety-and-soundness, consumer protection, and anti-money laundering. It also explains the division of regulatory authority between federal and state governments, which is a key factor in banking preemption. The report then goes into detail about the Supreme Court's decision in Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson, where the Court held that federal law preempts state laws that \"significantly interfere\" with the powers of national banks. It also discusses two Supreme Court decisions concerning the extent to which states may exercise \"visitorial powers\" over national banks. The report outlines the OCC's preemption rules and provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act concerning the preemption of state consumer protection laws. Finally, the report discusses current issues in banking preemption, including (1) the extent to which non-banks can benefit from federal preemption of state usury laws, (2) the OCC's decision to grant special purpose national bank charters to financial technology (FinTech) companies, and (3) proposals to provide legal protections to banks serving marijuana businesses that comply with state law.\n\nThe report is structured into several sections. First, it discusses general principles of federal preemption, which is grounded in the Supremacy Clause of Article VI of the Constitution. The Supreme Court has identified two ways in which federal law can preempt state law: 1) express preemption when a federal statute or regulation contains explicit preemptive language, and 2) implied preemption when Congress' command is implicitly contained in the relevant federal law's structure and purpose. The Court has identified two subcategories of implied preemption: field preemption and conflict preemption. Field preemption occurs when a federal regulatory scheme is so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that Congress left no room for the States to supplement it. Conflict preemption occurs when compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility, or when state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\n\nThe report then provides a brief history of the American \"dual banking system,\" explaining how the federal government and the states have regulated banks.

First, banks must abide by a variety of safety-and-soundness requirements designed to minimize the risk of their failure and maintain macroeconomic stability. Second, banks must comply with consumer protection rules intended to deter abusive practices and provide consumers with complete information about financial products and services. Third, banks are subject to various reporting, recordkeeping, and anti-money laundering requirements designed to assist law enforcement in investigating criminal activity. The substantive content of these requirements remains the subject of intense debate. However, the division of regulatory authority over banks between the federal government and the states plays a key role in shaping that content. In some cases, federal law displaces (or \"preempts\") state bank regulations. In other cases, states are permitted to supplement federal regulations with different, sometimes stricter requirements. Because of its substantive implications, federal preemption has recently become a flashpoint in debates surrounding bank regulation. In the American \"dual banking system,\" banks can apply for a national charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) or a state charter from a state's banking authority. A bank's choice of chartering authority is also a choice of primary regulator, as the OCC serves as the primary regulator of national banks and state regulatory agencies serve as the primary regulators of state-chartered banks. However, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) also play an important role in bank regulation. The Federal Reserve supervises all national banks and state-chartered banks that become members of the Federal Reserve System (FRS), while the FDIC supervises all state banks that do not become members of the FRS. This complex regulatory architecture has resulted in a \"symbiotic system\" with both federal regulation of state banks and state regulation of national banks. In the modern dual banking system, national banks are often subject to generally applicable state laws, and state banks are subject to both generally applicable federal laws and regulations imposed by their federal regulators. The evolution of this system during the 20th century caused the regulation of national banks and state banks to converge in a number of important ways. However, despite this convergence, federal preemption provides national banks with certain unique advantages. In Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson, the Supreme Court held that the National Bank Act (NBA) preempts state laws that \"significantly interfere\" with the powers of national banks. The Court has also issued two decisions on the preemptive scope of a provision of the NBA limiting states' \"visitorial powers\" over national banks. Finally, OCC rules have taken a broad view of the preemptive effects of the NBA, limiting the ways in which states can regulate national banks. Courts, regulators, and legislators have recently confronted a number of issues involving banking preemption and related federalism questions. Specifically, Congress has considered legislation that would overturn a line of judicial decisions concerning the circumstances in which non-banks can benefit from federal preemption of state usury laws. The OCC has also announced its intention to grant national bank charters to certain financial technology (FinTech) companies—a decision that is currently being litigated. Finally, Congress has recently turned its attention to the banking industry's response to state efforts to legalize and regulate marijuana."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8713}

Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points.\n\nThe report is for Congress, discussing the TAO-205 program, which is building 20 fleet oilers for the Navy. The Navy is requesting funding for the fifth and sixth ships in FY2020. Congress has to decide whether to approve, reject, or modify the funding request. Also, they need to consider the number of oilers needed in the future and whether to add more self-defense equipment than currently planned.\n\nThe report explains the role of fleet oilers, which are crucial for transferring fuel and other supplies to Navy ships, enabling them to operate at sea. They are part of the Navy's Combat Logistics Force (CLF), which includes other replenishment ships. The current fleet of oilers is the 15 Kaiser (TAO-187) class, built between 1982-1989, with an expected service life of 35 years. The first ship in this class will reach 35 years in 2021. These ships are about 677 feet long and have a full load displacement of about 41,000 tons, including about 26,500 tons of fuel and other cargo. The ships were built by Avondale Shipyards, which became part of HII. HII now operates other shipyards but no longer builds ships at Avondale.\n\nThe TAO-205 class was originally called TAO(X), with the X meaning the exact design hadn't been determined. The first ship in the class, TAO-205, was named after John Lewis, a civil rights leader. The class is now known as the John Lewis (TAO-205) class.

{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points. \n\nThe report is about the federal government's three service classifications: competitive service, excepted service, and Senior Executive Service (SES). The main differences between these classifications are in hiring, removal, and pay structures. \n\nFirst, the competitive service is the largest part of the federal workforce, with over two million employees. These positions are filled through competitive examinations, which are objective and based on the applicants' ability. The competitive service includes all civil service positions except those in the excepted service, SES, and some other specific categories. \n\nThen there's the excepted service, which includes positions not in the competitive service or SES. These positions are exempt from competitive exams, either by statute or by OPM. They are categorized into four schedules (A, B, C, D), each with different qualifications and purposes. For example, Schedule A includes positions that are not of a confidential or policy-determining character and are not practicable to examine, like attorneys and chaplains. Schedule B includes similar positions but requires meeting basic qualification standards. Schedule C includes policy-determining or confidential positions, such as most political appointees below the cabinet. Schedule D includes STEM positions and those in the Presidential Management Fellows Program. \n\nThe SES is a separate cadre of high-level administrators who manage major programs and projects within federal agencies. They are governed by a regulatory structure different from the competitive and excepted services. SES positions are generally managerial or supervisory, classified above the GS-15 grade. They are subject to different hiring and removal standards, as well as a distinct pay scale. \n\nThe report also discusses the administrative processes for the competitive service, including examinations conducted by OPM, the criteria for selecting candidates, and the procedures for adverse actions. It mentions the different types of appointments (career-conditional, career, term, temporary) and their implications. \n\nFor the excepted service, the report explains the different pay structures and notice/ appeal rights, noting that some employees (like preference eligibles) have different durational requirements before these rights are available. \n\nThe SES pay structure is also distinct, with a minimum rate of 120% of the GS-15, step 1, and a maximum rate of Level III of the Executive Schedule. However,", "answers": ["According to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the federal workforce consists of an estimated two million civilian employees. Federal law categorizes these employees into three types of service—the competitive service, the excepted service, and the Senior Executive Service (SES)—that may be distinguished by different selection, compensation, and other standards. Title 5 of the U.S. Code (Title 5) contains most of the standards governing federal employment, and OPM is generally responsible for implementing these requirements. The competitive service largely consists of all civil service positions in the executive branch, other than (1) positions excepted from the competitive service by statute; (2) positions appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate; and (3) the SES. Traditionally, OPM has administered examinations for entrance into the competitive service. These examinations are meant to be \"practical in character\" and relate to \"matters that fairly test the relative capacity and fitness of the applicants for the appointment sought.\" Title 5 also authorizes OPM to prescribe rules allowing agencies to hire candidates directly under specified circumstances. The excepted service includes designated civil service positions that are not in the competitive service or the SES and are not subject to competitive examination. OPM maintains authority to exempt a position from the competitive service when it determines that an appointment through competitive examination is not practicable, or the recruitment of students or recent graduates would be better achieved through alternate recruitment and assessment processes. The pay structure for the competitive service and the excepted service is similar. Both services are typically paid in accordance with the General Schedule, a schedule of annual basic pay rates that consists of 15 grades, designated \"GS-1\" through \"GS-15.\" This fixed pay scale is generally designed to reflect, among other things, equal pay for substantially equal work within a local pay area. Additionally, the competitive service and the excepted service generally have similar notice and appeal rights for adverse personnel actions. For example, before a removal, a suspension for more than 14 days, a reduction in grade or pay, or a furlough of 30 days or less, the agency must provide at least 30 days' advance written notice to the affected employee. The employee must also be given a reasonable time to respond to the notice and provide affidavits and other evidence to support the answer. Some adverse actions may also be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB or Board), an independent, quasi-judicial agency that reviews and adjudicates specified personnel actions taken against qualifying federal employees. The SES is a corps of some 7,000 high-level government administrators who manage major programs and projects within most federal agencies. In these leadership roles, SES members may serve as a link between top-level political appointees of an agency and career civil servants within the agency. The SES is governed by a regulatory structure separate from the competitive and excepted services. While SES members are primarily career appointees chosen through a merit-based competitive hiring process, others are noncareer, limited term or limited emergency appointees (commonly political appointees) selected by agency leadership. To shield certain SES roles from political influence, some SES positions (career reserved positions) must be filled with career appointees, and Title 5 limits the number of noncareer and limited term appointees that may serve in SES positions. The SES pay structure is distinct from the rest of the civil service. Title 5 specifies that SES members are paid within a particular range based on an executive's individual performance or contribution to agency performance (or both), as measured under a performance appraisal system. In addition, Title 5 articulates special conditions and procedures for removing, suspending, or taking other adverse actions against a member of the SES. For example, career SES appointees who have successfully completed a one-year probationary period may be removed or subject to adverse action only for specified reasons, including misconduct and substandard performance. Career appointees must receive advance written notice of these actions, and an opportunity to appeal the action. In comparison, noncareer, limited term, and limited emergency appointees are generally not subject to the same protections and may be removed from the SES at any time."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2697}

U.S. Navy Admiral Philip Davidson, in his responses to advance policy questions from the Senate Armed Services Committee for an April 17, 2018, hearing to consider his nomination to become Commander, U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM), stated that \"China is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in all scenarios short of war with the United States.\" Chinese control of the SCS—and, more generally, Chinese domination of China's near-seas region, meaning the SCS, the East China Sea (ECS), and the Yellow Sea—could substantially affect U.S. strategic, political, and economic interests in the Indo-Pacific region and elsewhere. China is a party to multiple territorial disputes in the SCS and ECS, including, in particular, disputes with multiple neighboring countries over the Paracel Islands, Spratly Islands, and Scarborough Shoal in the SCS, and with Japan over the Senkaku Islands in the ECS. Up through 2014, U.S. concern over these disputes centered more on their potential for causing tension, incidents, and a risk of conflict between China and its neighbors in the region, including U.S. allies Japan and the Philippines and emerging partner states such as Vietnam. While that concern remains, particularly regarding the potential for a conflict between China and Japan involving the Senkaku Islands, U.S. concern since 2014 (i.e., since China's island-building activities in the Spratly Islands were first publicly reported) has shifted increasingly to how China's strengthening position in the SCS may be affecting the risk of a U.S.-China crisis or conflict in the SCS and the broader U.S.-Chinese strategic competition. In addition to territorial disputes in the SCS and ECS, China is involved in a dispute, particularly with the United States, over whether China has a right under international law to regulate the activities of foreign military forces operating within China's exclusive economic zone (EEZ). The position of the United States and most other countries is that while international law gives coastal states the right to regulate economic activities (such as fishing and oil exploration) within their EEZs, it does not give coastal states the right to regulate foreign military activities in the parts of their EEZs beyond their 12-nautical-mile territorial waters. The position of China and some other countries (i.e., a minority group among the world's nations) is that UNCLOS gives coastal states the right to regulate not only economic activities, but also foreign military activities, in their EEZs. The dispute appears to be at the heart of multiple incidents between Chinese and U.S. ships and aircraft in international waters and airspace since 2001, and has potential implications not only for China's EEZs, but for U.S. naval operations in EEZs globally, and for international law of the sea. A key issue for Congress is how the United States should respond to China's actions in the SCS and ECS—particularly its island-building and base-construction activities in the Spratly Islands—and to China's strengthening position in the SCS. A key oversight question for Congress is whether the Trump Administration has an appropriate strategy—and an appropriate amount of resources for implementing that strategy—for countering China's \"salami-slicing\" strategy or gray zone operations for gradually strengthening its position in the SCS, for imposing costs on China for its actions in the SCS and ECS, and for defending and promoting U.S. interests in the region."], "all_classes": null, "length": 40508}

It outlines the structure of these labs, which are managed within the military service chain of command, and highlights the key authorities, including the Laboratory Initiated Research Authority, Direct Hire Authorities, Laboratory Enhancement Pilot Program, and Micro-purchase Authority. These authorities allow defense lab directors to fund projects in four categories: basic and applied research, technology transition, workforce development, and revitalization, recapitalization, or repair of lab infrastructure. The report also discusses the varying funding models used by the military service labs, such as the Air Force and Army relying on mission funding or customer funding, while the Navy operates under the Navy Working Capital Fund—a revolving fund that finances Department of the Navy activities on a reimbursable basis. Additionally, the report highlights the use of other entities, such as Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) and University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs), which provide specialized research and development services under long-term contracts. These centers are often affiliated with universities and are not allowed to compete against industry in response to a competitive Request for Proposal for development or production that involves engineering expertise. The report also discusses the key DOD offices that provide oversight to the defense labs, including the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&E))—the principal advisor to the Secretary of Defense for research, engineering, and technology development activities and programs—serves as DOD’s chief technology officer. The report highlights the use of the laboratory initiated research authority, which provides lab directors with the means to fund projects they consider to be a priority in four allowable categories: (1) basic and applied research, (2) technology transition, (3) workforce development, and (4) revitalization, recapitalization, or repair or minor military construction of lab infrastructure. These projects include those not specifically tied to defined requirements, outside of the normal 2-year budget planning process.

The authority directs the Secretary of Defense to establish mechanisms under which lab directors may use an amount of funds equal to not less than 2 percent", "answers": ["Congress created several authorities that provide DOD research labs with ways to increase efficiency and foster innovation. Senate report 114-255 contained a provision for GAO to study governance models used by federal labs. This report evaluates DOD labs' use of authorities to foster innovation and efficiency. GAO selected four authorities that recent work on best practices for science and technology management and expedited defense lab hiring have shown to be the most crucial for supporting innovation; administered a survey to 44 lab directors to gain insight into their use of the authorities; interviewed key lab officials and contractors; and reviewed relevant policies and guidance. Congress has provided the Department of Defense's (DOD) research labs with several authorities to enhance management and operations. Four authorities that GAO examined provide lab directors with greater ability to make their own decisions regarding the funding of projects, hiring, lab management, and purchasing of equipment or services. 1. Laboratory initiated research authority. This authority, as implemented, provides labs with a means to fund new science and technology projects that they consider a priority. Labs may use a percentage of all funds available to the lab and are permitted to charge customers of the lab a percentage fee of the costs for activities performed by the lab for the customer. 2. Direct hire authority. This authority enables labs to compete with private industry for high-quality talent. For example, it provides for streamlined hiring of applicants with relevant advanced degrees, or students enrolled in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics programs. 3. Laboratory enhancement pilot program authority. This authority generally allows lab directors to propose alternative methods that might lead to more effective lab management, and waive certain policies or procedures that might affect implementation of these methods. 4. Micro-purchase authority. This authority raises the threshold for small purchases for DOD research lab activities from $3,500 to $10,000 to facilitate acquisitions. While labs have used these authorities, their use has sometimes been limited, particularly with the laboratory initiated research authority. DOD lab directors at Air Force, Navy, and Army cited several obstacles that impede wider use of that authority, specifically: Air Force: Financial management officials at the Air Force stated that the service's accounting system does not currently have an automated capability to transfer the allowable percentage fee of costs to a central account at the Air Force Research Laboratory. This lack of capability, officials noted, creates a significant administrative burden related to charging these fees. Navy: In fiscal year 2017, Navy labs invested $7.3 million in lab infrastructure projects, compared to $32.9 million and $53.7 million at the Air Force and Army, respectively. Navy lab officials told us that they were restricted in their use of infrastructure funds available under the laboratory initiated research authority due to a lack of clear guidance as to whether and how to use this authority within the Capital Investment Program of the Navy Working Capital Fund. Army: The Army requires its labs to use a similar percentage of funds from two sources: (1) what it refers to as directly appropriated funds and (2) funds labs charge for customer activities. Some Army lab directors reported assessing a lower rate on customer funds than allowed so as not to drive customers away. The labs then generally charge a lower than desired rate on their directly appropriated funds, which further constrains the total funding available to them. GAO is making three recommendations to enhance DOD's use of laboratory initiated research authority, including that the Air Force assess potential accounting system improvements, the Navy clarify how labs can use the authority for infrastructure improvements, and the Army assess its policy to determine whether changes are needed to remove disincentives for labs to use the authority.

The assistance includes operational, logistical, and technical support; financial assistance through grants, loans, and loan guarantees; and the provision of federally owned equipment and facilities. Most of the programs are available after the President issues a major disaster declaration under the Stafford Act, while more limited aid is available under an emergency declaration or on an as needed basis. The report focuses on programs that are frequently used to provide financial assistance in the disaster response and recovery process, providing brief descriptions to help congressional offices determine which programs merit further consideration in the planning, organization, or execution of the disaster response and recovery process. Most of the programs listed here are specifically authorized for use during situations occurring because of a disaster. General assistance programs that may apply to disaster situations are described at the end of the report. The Individuals and Households Program (IHP) is the primary vehicle for FEMA assistance to individuals and households after the President issues an emergency or major disaster declaration, when authorized. It is intended to meet basic needs and support recovery efforts, but it cannot compensate disaster survivors for all losses. IHP assistance is available in the form of financial and direct assistance to eligible individuals and households who, as a result of a disaster, have uninsured or under-insured necessary expenses and serious needs that cannot be met through other means or forms of assistance. Program funds have a wide range of eligible uses, including different forms of temporary housing assistance; housing repairs; housing replacement; and permanent housing construction. IHP funds may also be used for other needs assistance (ONA), including funeral, medical, dental, childcare, personal property, transportation, and other expenses. FEMA provides 100% of the housing assistance costs, but ONA is subject to a 75% federal and 25% state cost share.

{"pred": " The report discusses the processes and challenges faced by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in reviewing state-reported expenditures for Medicaid programs. Key points include the following: States are required to report their expenditures to CMS within 30 days of the end of each quarter, but may adjust their past reporting for up to 2 years after the expenditure was made, referred to as the 2-year filing limit. Adjustments can reflect resolved disputes or reclassifications of expenditures. Expenditures reported after the 2-year filing limit are generally not eligible for a federal match, with certain exceptions. The CMS-64 is a series of forms that capture expenditure data for different aspects of states’ Medicaid programs, such as different types of services, populations, and different federal matching rates. States report their expenditures quarterly on the CMS-64 at an aggregate level— such as a state’s total expenditures for such categories of services as inpatient hospital services—and these reported expenditures are not linked to individual enrollees or services. The CMS-64 is a series of forms that capture expenditure data for different aspects of states’ Medicaid programs, such as different types of services, populations, and different federal matching rates. (See table 1 for examples of the expenditure types captured by the CMS-64.) States report their expenditures quarterly on the CMS-64 at an aggregate level— such as a state’s total expenditures for such categories of services as inpatient hospital services—and these reported expenditures are not linked to individual enrollees or services. States’ reporting may vary depending on the features of their Medicaid program. Some examples of this variation include the following: States that expanded eligibility under PPACA would need to report expenditures not only by the type of services (e.g., inpatient hospital services), but also by populations receiving different federal matching rates, such as expansion enrollees. States with waivers—that is, where the state received approval from HHS to waive certain Medicaid requirements in order to test and evaluate new approaches for delivering and financing care under a demonstration—would need to report those expenditures associated with these waivers on additional forms. CMS is responsible for ensuring that expenditures reported by states are supported and allowable, meaning that the state actually made and recorded the expenditure and that the expenditure is consistent with Medicaid requirements. CMS regional offices perform the ongoing oversight, with enhanced oversight procedures in the 20 states with the highest federal Medicaid expenditures. (See fig.1) CMS is required to review the expenditures reported by states each quarter. (See fig.", "answers": ["Medicaid has grown by over 50 percent over the last decade, with about $370 billion in federal spending in fiscal year 2017. CMS is responsible for assuring that expenditures—reported quarterly by states—are consistent with Medicaid requirements and matched with the correct amount of federal funds. CMS's review of reported expenditures has become increasingly complex due to variation in states' Medicaid programs and an increasing number of different matching rates. GAO was asked to examine CMS's oversight of state-reported Medicaid expenditures. In this report, GAO examined how CMS assures that (1) expenditures are supported and consistent with requirements; and (2) the correct federal matching rates were applied to expenditures subject to a higher match. GAO also examined the financial impact of resolved errors. GAO reviewed documentation for the most recently completed quarterly reviews by 3 of CMS's 10 regional offices for six states that varied by Medicaid program expenditures and design. GAO also reviewed policies, procedures, and data on resolved errors; and interviewed CMS and state officials. GAO assessed CMS's oversight processes against federal standards for internal control. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which oversees Medicaid, has various review processes in place to assure that expenditures reported by states are supported and consistent with Medicaid requirements. The agency also has processes to review that the correct federal matching rates were applied to expenditures receiving a higher than standard federal matching rate, which can include certain types of services and populations. These processes collectively have had a considerable federal financial benefit, with CMS resolving errors that reduced federal spending by over $5.1 billion in fiscal years 2014 through 2017. However, GAO identified weaknesses in how CMS targets its resources to address risks when reviewing whether expenditures are supported and consistent with requirements. CMS devotes similar levels of staff resources to review expenditures despite differing levels of risk across states. For example, the number of staff reviewing California's expenditures—which represent 15 percent of federal Medicaid spending—is similar to the number reviewing Arkansas' expenditures, which represents 1 percent of federal Medicaid spending. CMS cancelled in-depth financial management reviews in 17 out of 51 instances over the last 5 years. These reviews target expenditures considered by CMS to be at risk of not meeting program requirements. CMS told GAO that resource constraints contributed to both weaknesses. However, the agency has not completed a comprehensive assessment of risk to (1) determine whether oversight resources are adequate and (2) focus on the most significant areas of risk. Absent such an assessment, CMS is missing an opportunity to identify errors in reported expenditures that could result in substantial savings to the Medicaid program. GAO also found limitations in CMS's processes for reviewing expenditures that receive a higher federal matching rate. Internal guidance for examining variances in these expenditures was unclear, and not all reviewers in the three CMS regional offices GAO reviewed were investigating significant variances in quarter-to-quarter expenditures. Review procedures for expenditures for individuals newly eligible for Medicaid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act were not tailored to different risk levels among states. For example, in its reviews of a sample of claims for this population, CMS reviewed claims for the same number of enrollees—30—in California as for Arkansas, even though California had 10 times the number of newly eligible enrollees as Arkansas. Without clear internal guidance and better targeting of risks in its review procedures for expenditures receiving higher matching rates, CMS may overpay states.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this detailed report about Egypt's political history and current situation. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points.\n\nThe report begins by mentioning the Egyptian military's role in producing four presidents since 1952. It notes that the military has consistently backed these leaders, with the exception of the Muslim Brotherhood, which has opposed military rule and advocated for a state governed by civil and Sharia law. The only significant departure from this pattern was during the Arab Spring, which led to the military forcing the resignation of Hosni Mubarak in 2011. This period saw political turmoil, culminating in the one-year presidency of Muhammad Morsi from the Muslim Brotherhood. Morsi's rule, however, exposed deep divisions in Egyptian politics, leading to mutual distrust and political gridlock. This environment allowed the military, led by Sisi, to reassert control, leading to the military's intervention in 2013 and the subsequent crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nThe report then discusses Egypt's economic recovery, including the role of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the economic reforms implemented. It mentions the economic growth projections, the impact of austerity measures, and the challenges of high inflation. The report also covers Egypt's foreign policy, including its role in the region and its relationships with various countries like the United States, the Arab Gulf states, Israel, Russia, and France. It highlights the efforts of President Sisi to consolidate power, including the military's role in the economy and the crackdown on dissent, which has led to international criticism.\n\nThe report also touches on Egypt's economic reforms, such as the depreciation of the currency, reduction of fuel subsidies, and the introduction of a value-added tax (VAT). It mentions the government's efforts to allocate resources to debt service payments, which has led to a reduction in spending on health and education. The IMF has praised Egypt's reform implementation but also highlights the need for private sector growth to absorb the rapidly growing labor force and ensure the benefits are perceived more widely.\n\nAdditionally, the report discusses Egypt's military's role in the economy, including their production of goods and services, and their expansion into new markets. It mentions the military's economic self-sufficiency and their role in infrastructure contracts. The report also covers Egypt's military's economic power, which is rarely quantified due to political sensitivities.\n\nThe report then moves on to discuss Egypt's military's role in the region,", "answers": ["Historically, Egypt has been an important country for U.S. national security interests based on its geography, demography, and diplomatic posture. Egypt controls the Suez Canal, which is one of the world's most well-known maritime chokepoints, linking the Mediterranean and Red Seas. Egypt, with its population of more than 100 million people, is by far the most populous Arabic-speaking country. Although it may not play the same type of leading political or military role in the Arab world as it has in the past, Egypt may retain some \"soft power\" by virtue of its history, media, and culture. Cairo plays host both to the 22-member Arab League and Al Azhar University, which claims to be the oldest continuously operating university in the world and has symbolic importance as a leading source of Islamic scholarship. Additionally, Egypt's 1979 peace treaty with Israel remains one of the most significant diplomatic achievements for the promotion of Arab-Israeli peace. While people-to-people relations remain cold, the Israeli and Egyptian governments have increased their cooperation against Islamist militants and instability in the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip. Personnel moves and possible amendments to the Egyptian constitution highlight apparent efforts by President Sisi to consolidate power with the help of political allies, including colleagues from Egypt's security establishment. President Sisi has come under repeated international criticism for an ongoing government crackdown against various forms of political dissent and freedom of expression. The Egyptian government has defended its human rights record, asserting that the country is under pressure from terrorist groups seeking to destabilize Arab nation-states. The Trump Administration has tried to normalize ties with the Sisi government that were generally perceived as strained under President Obama. In January 2019, U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo delivered a major policy speech at the American University in Cairo, where he stated, \"And as we seek an even stronger partnership with Egypt, we encourage President Sisi to unleash the creative energy of Egypt's people, unfetter the economy, and promote a free and open exchange of ideas.\" The United States has provided significant military and economic assistance to Egypt since the late 1970s. Successive U.S. Administrations have justified aid to Egypt as an investment in regional stability, built primarily on long-running cooperation with the Egyptian military and on sustaining the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. All U.S. foreign aid to Egypt (or any recipient) is appropriated and authorized by Congress. Since 1946, the United States has provided Egypt with over $83 billion in bilateral foreign aid (calculated in historical dollars—not adjusted for inflation). Annual appropriations legislation includes several conditions governing the release of these funds. All U.S. military aid to Egypt finances the procurement of weapons systems and services from U.S. defense contractors. For FY2019, Congress has appropriated $1.4 billion in total bilateral assistance for Egypt, the same amount it provided in FY2018. For FY2020, the President is requesting a total of $1.382 billion in bilateral assistance for Egypt. Nearly all of the U.S. funds for Egypt come from the FMF account (military aid). In November 2018, the U.S. Defense Department notified Congress of a major $1 billion sale of defense equipment to Egypt, consisting of 10 AH-64E Apache Attack Helicopters, among other things. Beyond the United States, President Sisi has broadened Egypt's international base of support to include several key partners, including the Arab Gulf states, Israel, Russia, and France.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is about DOD's use of commercially hosted payloads on commercial satellites. \n\nFirst, the report defines a hosted payload as a package of equipment integrated onto a host satellite, using its resources like size, weight, power, or communications. These can be experimental or operational. Experimental payloads test new technologies, while operational deliver capabilities to end users. \n\nThe report mentions that some missions are unsuitable for hosted payloads. For example, if a payload is too large or requires too much power, or needs unique satellite maneuvers that could negatively affect the host's primary mission. \n\nCivil agencies like NASA and NOAA have used or plan to use commercially hosted payloads. The report lists benefits such as cost savings, faster on-orbit capability, increased deterrence and resilience, continual technology upgrades, and industrial base stability. \n\nDOD has been looking into ways to break up larger satellites into smaller ones, known as disaggregation. The report discusses the challenges in matching government payloads with commercial hosts, including size, weight, power, and spectrum needs. \n\nThe report also talks about the Hosted Payload Office (HPO) and its initiatives, like the Hosted Payload Solutions (HOPS) contract, which helps programs find commercial hosts. The HPO also develops guidelines and tools to address challenges in matching payloads with hosts. \n\nHowever, the report points out that DOD has limited information on the costs and benefits of these payloads, leading to resistance in adopting this approach. The knowledge is fragmented across the agency, with multiple offices collecting piecemeal information. \n\nThe report also discusses the challenges in aligning the development and acquisition timelines of a government payload and a commercial host satellite. The timeline for developing government sensors is generally much longer than that of commercial satellites, creating difficulties in scheduling and funding. \n\nAdditionally, the report mentions concerns about combining government and commercial space missions, such as losing control over a hosted payload if a commercial company's needs change. There are also cybersecurity concerns regarding data security when using hosted payloads. \n\nThe report concludes that DOD needs to collect and centralize data on the use of these payloads to make informed decisions. It recommends that the Secretary of Defense require programs using hosted payloads to provide cost and technical data to a central office, possibly the Hosted Payload Office. \n\nI need to condense all this into a one-page summary. Let me structure it with an", "answers": ["Each year, DOD spends billions of dollars to develop, produce, and field large, complex satellites. For such satellite systems, a single adversary attack or on-orbit failure can result in the loss of billions of dollars of investment and significant loss of vital capabilities. As DOD plans new space systems and addresses an increasingly contested space environment, it has the opportunity to consider different acquisition approaches. One such approach is to integrate a government sensor or payload onto a commercial host satellite. House Armed Services Committee report 115-200, accompanying a bill for the Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, included a provision for GAO to review DOD's use of commercially hosted payloads. This report (1) determines the extent to which DOD uses commercially hosted payloads and (2) describes and assesses factors that affect their use. GAO reviewed DOD policies, documentation, and planning documents, and interviewed a wide range of DOD and civil government officials, and commercial stakeholders. GAO and others have found that using commercial satellites to host government sensors or communications packages—called payloads—may be one way DOD can achieve on-orbit capability faster and more affordably. Using hosted payloads may also help facilitate a proliferation of payloads on orbit, making it more difficult for an adversary to defeat a capability. Since 2009, DOD has used three commercially hosted payloads, with three more missions planned or underway through 2022 (see figure below). DOD estimates that it has achieved cost savings of several hundred million dollars from using commercially hosted payloads to date, and expects to realize additional savings and deliver faster capabilities on orbit from planned missions. Cost savings can result from sharing development, launch, and ground system costs with the commercial host company. Among the factors that affect DOD's use of hosted payloads are a perception among some DOD officials that matching government payloads to commercial satellites is too difficult; and limited, fragmented knowledge on how to mitigate various challenges GAO found that further opportunities to use hosted payloads may emerge as DOD plans new and follow-on space systems in the coming years. However, DOD's knowledge on using hosted payloads is fragmented, in part because programs are not required to share information. In 2011, the Air Force created a Hosted Payload Office to provide expertise and other tools to facilitate matching government payloads with commercial hosts. However, GAO found that DOD programs using hosted payloads are not required and generally do not provide cost and technical data, or lessons learned, to the Hosted Payload Office, or another central office for analysis. Requiring programs that use hosted payloads agency-wide to provide this information to a central location would better position DOD to make informed decisions when considering acquisition approaches for upcoming space system designs. GAO recommends that DOD require programs using commercially hosted payloads to contribute resulting data to a central location. In implementing this recommendation, DOD should assess whether the Air Force's Hosted Payload Office is the appropriate location to collect and analyze the data. DOD concurred with the recommendation."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5576}
{"pred": " The report discusses the technology sector's major employment hubs, including the San Francisco Bay area, the greater New York City region, and the Washington-Arlington-Alexandria region. Technology workers are also employed at companies outside the technology sector, such as in the retail or financial services industries. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) are responsible for enforcing federal antidiscrimination laws and ensuring that federal contractors comply with nondiscrimination and affirmative action requirements. The EEOC primarily investigates individual charges of employment discrimination filed against companies, while the OFCCP enforces compliance through various procedures, including compliance evaluations and investigations. The report highlights that while the technology sector has seen significant growth in employment, there are persistent disparities in the representation of women, Black, and Hispanic workers compared to their representation in the general workforce. Despite the growth in the technology workforce, the percentage of women in the technology workforce remained flat, and women were a smaller proportion of the technology workforce compared to their representation in the general workforce. Although the estimated percentage of minority technology workers as a whole had grown since 2005, this trend did not apply to Black technology workers. Specifically, from 2005 through 2015, although the number of Black workers increased as the technology workforce grew, there was no statistically significant change in their representation as a percentage of the entire technology workforce. In contrast, Hispanic and Asian technology workers had statistically significant increases in their representation in the technology workforce. Even with the increase in their numbers in the technology workforce, Black and Hispanic technology workers remained a smaller proportion of these workers compared to their representation in the general workforce. In contrast, Asian workers were an increasing share of the technology workforce, where they remained more represented than they were in the general workforce. The report also discusses the efforts by EEOC and OFCCP to oversee technology companies and their compliance with equal employment opportunity and affirmative action requirements. It highlights the challenges faced by these agencies in their efforts to ensure compliance with federal antidiscrimination laws and the need for improvements in their processes. The report concludes with six recommendations for both EEOC and OFCCP to enhance their oversight of technology companies and contractors. These recommendations include developing a timeline for cleaning the EEOC's Integrated Mission System (IMS) data, requiring contractors to set placement goals for specific minority groups, assessing the quality of methods used to incorporate industry disparities into the selection process, evaluating the current approach to identifying entities for compliance", "answers": ["Technology companies are a major source of high-paying U.S. jobs, but some have questioned the sector's commitment to equal employment opportunity. EEOC provides federal oversight of nondiscrimination requirements by investigating charges of discrimination, and OFCCP enforces federal contractors' compliance with affirmative action requirements. GAO was asked to review workforce trends in the technology sector and federal oversight. This report examines (1) trends in the gender, racial, and ethnic composition of the technology sector workforce; and (2) EEOC and OFCCP oversight of technology companies' compliance with equal employment and affirmative action requirements. GAO analyzed workforce data from the American Community Survey for 2005-2015 and EEOC Employer Information Reports for 2007-2015, the latest data available during our analysis. GAO analyzed OFCCP data on compliance evaluations for fiscal years 2011-2016. GAO interviewed agency officials, researchers, and workforce, industry, and company representatives. The estimated percentage of minority technology workers increased from 2005 to 2015, but GAO found that no growth occurred for female and Black workers, whereas Asian and Hispanic workers made statistically significant increases (see figure). Further, female, Black, and Hispanic workers remain a smaller proportion of the technology workforce—mathematics, computing, and engineering occupations—compared to their representation in the general workforce. These groups have also been less represented among technology workers inside the technology sector than outside it. In contrast, Asian workers were more represented in these occupations than in the general workforce. Stakeholders and researchers GAO interviewed identified several factors that may have contributed to the lower representation of certain groups, such as fewer women and minorities graduating with technical degrees and company hiring and retention practices. Both the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) have taken steps to enforce equal employment and affirmative action requirements in the technology sector, but face limitations. While EEOC has identified barriers to recruitment and hiring in the technology sector as a strategic priority, when EEOC conducts investigations, it does not systematically record the type of industry, therefore limiting sector-related analyses to help focus its efforts. EEOC has plans to determine how to add missing industry codes but has not set a timeframe to do this. In addition, OFCCP's regulations may hinder its ability to enforce contractors' compliance because OFCCP directs contractors to set placement goals for all minorities as a group rather than for specific racial/ethnic groups. OFCCP also has not made changes to its establishment-based approach to selecting entities for review in decades, even though changes have occurred in how workplaces are structured. Without taking steps to address these issues, OFCCP may miss opportunities to hold contractors responsible for complying with affirmative action and nondiscrimination requirements. GAO makes 6 recommendations, including that EEOC develop a timeline to improve industry data collection and OFCCP take steps toward requiring more specific minority placement goals by contractors and assess key aspects of its selection approach. EEOC neither agreed nor disagreed with its recommendation, and OFCCP stated the need for regulatory change to alter placement goal requirements.

{"pred": " The report discusses the CHIP-IN Act, a pilot program that allows VA to use private donations to build medical facilities. The program was initiated due to the Omaha donor group's interest in constructing an ambulatory care center to address veterans' needs, as the VA was unable to build a replacement medical center due to a backlog of projects. The CHIP-IN Act authorized five pilot projects, but did not name any specific project locations. The Omaha donor group applied to participate in the pilot program with the construction of an ambulatory care center, and VA executed a donation agreement in April 2017. The CHIP-IN Act places certain requirements on donations under the pilot program, including that the property has already received appropriations for a VA facility project or has been identified as a need as part of VA’s long-range capital planning process. The report also highlights the challenges of establishing partnerships under the pilot program, including the reliance on large philanthropic donations and the lack of marketing and philanthropic development expertise within the VA. The report concludes that without a strengthened pilot design, including measurable objectives, an assessment methodology, and an evaluation plan, it may be unclear to VA and Congress whether the CHIP-IN approach could be part of a longer-term strategy or how lessons learned could enhance other VA construction efforts. The report also makes three recommendations to VA to improve the pilot program.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points. \n\nThe report is about the CHIP-IN Act, which is a pilot program that allows the VA to use private donations to build medical facilities. The main factors that led to the creation of this act were the Omaha donor group's interest in building an ambulatory care center to address veterans' needs, given uncertainty about when or if the VA would build a replacement medical center. The VA had allocated $56 million for the design of the replacement medical center, which had an estimated total cost of $560 million. However, due to the VA's backlog of construction projects, the replacement medical center wasn't among its near-term projects. Meanwhile, the Omaha donor group and VA discussed changing the project's scope from a replacement medical center to a smaller project for a new ambulatory care center, which could be constructed using the existing appropriation of $56 million plus a donation from the Omaha donor group. Another factor was the Congress's and VA's broader interest in testing innovative approaches to meeting VA's infrastructure needs. The CHIP-IN Act authorized five pilot projects but didn't", "answers": ["VA has pressing infrastructure needs. The Communities Helping Invest through Property and Improvements Needed for Veterans Act of 2016 (CHIP-IN Act) authorized VA to accept donated real property—such as buildings or facility construction or improvements—through a pilot program. VA has initiated one project in Omaha, Nebraska, through a partnership with a donor group. VA can accept up to five donations through the pilot program, which is authorized through 2021. The CHIP-IN Act includes a provision for GAO to report on donation agreements. This report (1) examines the extent to which the VA's pilot design aligns with leading practices and (2) discusses what VA has learned from the pilot to date. GAO reviewed VA documents, including plans for the pilot program, and visited the Omaha pilot project. GAO interviewed VA officials, the Omaha donor group, and three non-federal entities that responded to VA's request seeking donors. GAO compared implementation of VA's pilot to leading practices for pilot design, organizational transformation, and cross-functional teams. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is conducting a pilot program, called CHIP-IN, that allows VA to partner with non-federal entities and accept real property donations from them as a way to help address VA's infrastructure needs. Although VA signed its first project agreement under the program in April 2017, VA has not yet established a framework for effective design of the pilot program. Specifically, VA's pilot program design is not aligned with four of five leading practices for designing a well-developed and documented pilot program. VA has begun to implement one leading practice by improving its efforts to communicate with relevant stakeholders, such as including external stakeholders in key meetings. However, the VA offices involved have not agreed upon and documented clear, measurable objectives for the pilot program, which is a leading practice. Further, VA has not developed an assessment methodology or an evaluation plan that would help inform decisions about whether or how the pilot approach could be expanded. While VA officials said they intend to develop these items as tasks for the newly formed CHIP-IN steering committee, they have no timeline for doing so. Without clear objectives and assessment and evaluation plans, VA and Congress may have difficulty determining whether the pilot approach is an effective way to help address VA's infrastructure needs. To date, the CHIP-IN pilot suggests that donation partnerships could improve construction projects, but identifying donors and establishing a team for the pilot program have presented challenges. Officials from VA and the donor group for the first pilot project—an ambulatory care center in Omaha, Nebraska—said they are completing the project faster than if it had been a standard federal construction project, while achieving potential cost savings by using private sector practices. However, VA officials said it is challenging to find partners to make large donations with no financial return, and VA's lack of marketing and philanthropic development experience exacerbates that challenge. VA and the donor group agreed that a dedicated team of individuals with relevant expertise could facilitate the pilot's implementation. The new CHIP-IN steering committee could serve this purpose, but it lacks documented roles and responsibilities. Establishing a team with clear roles and responsibilities and identifying both available and needed staff resources could assist VA in partnering with additional donors and creating new opportunities to meet veterans' needs.

The report outlines HUD's efforts in collaboration with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), highlighting the alignment of federal standards and guidelines for lead hazards in housing. HUD's lead hazard control grant programs, including the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control grant and the Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration grant, have incorporated Title X statutory requirements through recent annual funding notices and their grant processes. HUD requires lead grant applicants to make matching contributions with state, local, and private funds (i.e., nonfederal) toward the total cost of activities. For the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control grant program, the matching contribution has been set at no less than 10 percent of the total grant amount. For the Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration grant program, the matching contribution has been set at no less than 25 percent of the total grant amount. The report also discusses HUD's efforts to monitor and enforce compliance with lead paint regulations for its rental assistance programs, including the Housing Choice Voucher (voucher) and public housing programs. HUD has taken steps to strengthen compliance monitoring processes, but the report identifies several limitations that create risks in its new compliance monitoring approach. By developing a plan to mitigate and address these limitations, HUD could further strengthen its oversight and ensure that PHAs maintain lead-safe housing units. The report also highlights HUD's efforts to align its lead inspection standards with federal health guidelines and environmental standards, including the adoption of more protective requirements for identifying and addressing lead paint hazards in its rental assistance programs. Additionally, the report emphasizes the need for HUD to develop comprehensive performance goals and measures to fully cover its lead efforts, including efforts to ensure that housing units in its rental assistance programs are lead-safe. The report concludes with nine recommendations to HUD, addressing areas where the agency could improve the effectiveness of its efforts to identify and address lead paint hazards and protect children in low-income housing from lifelong health problems. These recommendations include improving documentation for grant processes, periodically evaluating grant processes, setting time frames for incorporating relevant data on lead paint hazard risks into the lead grant programs' processes, developing a plan to mitigate and address limitations within HUD's lead paint compliance monitoring processes, and developing performance goals and measures to cover the full range of HUD's lead efforts.

HUD awards grants to state and local governments to reduce lead paint hazards in housing and oversees compliance with lead paint regulations in its rental assistance programs.

This report examines HUD’s efforts to (1) incorporate statutory requirements and other relevant federal standards in its lead grant programs, (2) monitor and enforce compliance with lead paint regulations in its rental assistance programs, (3) adopt federal health guidelines and environmental standards for its lead grant and rental assistance programs, and (4) measure and report on the performance of its lead efforts. GAO reviewed HUD documents and data related to its grant programs, compliance efforts, performance measures, and reporting. GAO also interviewed HUD staff and some grantees. The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) lead grant and rental assistance programs have taken steps to address lead paint hazards, but opportunities exist for improvement. For example, in 2016, HUD began using new tools to monitor how public housing agencies comply with lead paint regulations. However, HUD could further improve efforts in the following areas: Lead grant programs. While its recent grant award processes incorporate statutory requirements on applicant eligibility and selection criteria, HUD has not fully documented or evaluated these processes. For example, HUD’s guidance is not sufficiently detailed to ensure consistent and appropriate grant award decisions. Better documentation and evaluation of HUD’s grant program processes could help ensure that lead grants reach areas at risk of lead paint hazards. Further, HUD has not developed specific time frames for using available local-level data to better identify areas of the country at risk for lead paint hazards, which could help HUD target its limited resources. Oversight. HUD does not have a plan to mitigate and address risks related to noncompliance with lead paint regulations by public housing agencies. We identified several limitations with HUD’s monitoring efforts, including reliance on public housing agencies’ self-certifying compliance with lead paint regulations and challenges identifying children with elevated blood lead levels. Additionally, HUD lacks detailed procedures for addressing noncompliance consistently and in a timely manner. Developing a plan and detailed procedures to address noncompliance with lead paint regulations could strengthen HUD’s oversight of public housing agencies. Inspections. The lead inspection standard for the Housing Choice Voucher program is less strict than that of the public housing program. By requesting and obtaining statutory authority to amend the standard for the voucher program, HUD would be positioned to take steps to better protect children in voucher units from lead exposure as indicated by analysis of benefits and costs. Performance assessment and reporting. HUD lacks comprehensive goals and performance measures for its lead reduction efforts. In addition, it has not complied with annual statutory reporting requirements, last reporting as required on its lead efforts in 1997. Without better performance assessment and reporting, HUD cannot fully assess the effectiveness of its lead efforts. GAO makes nine recommendations to HUD including to improve lead grant program and compliance monitoring processes, request authority to amend its lead inspection standard in the voucher program, and take additional steps to report on progress.

{"pred": " The report discusses the implementation of the GPRA Modernization Act (GPRAMA), which was enacted in 2010 to address longstanding federal performance challenges. GPRAMA aims to enhance the use of performance information, focusing on crosscutting issues and improving accountability for results. Key components of GPRAMA include:\n\n1. **Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals**: These are crosscutting and include outcome-oriented goals covering a limited number of policy areas as well as goals for management improvements needed across the government. OMB is to coordinate with agencies to establish CAP goals at least every 4 years.\n\n2. **Agency Priority Goals (APGs)**: Every 2 years, agencies are to identify a subset of performance goals as APGs, reflecting their highest priorities. These goals are informed by CAP goals and consultations with relevant congressional committees and other interested parties.\n\n3. **Strategic Reviews**: OMB guidance directs agencies to annually assess progress toward each strategic objective using a broad range of evidence. This process is intended to help decision-makers evaluate the effectiveness of programs and ensure that results are efficiently achieved.\n\nThe report also highlights several key areas where the federal government has made progress in addressing governance challenges, including:\n\n1. **Addressing Crosscutting Issues**: The federal government has made progress in addressing crosscutting issues, such as fragmentation, overlap, and duplication, which are common in federal agencies. For example, the Department of the Interior (Interior) has taken steps to address the issue of duplication in the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Park Service (NPS). These steps include the development of a statement that addresses whether there is any overlap or duplication of proposed projects or activities to be funded by the grant. This statement is to be provided by the grant awarding office to the grant awarding office. This process is intended to help the federal government better understand the federal investment and results in given policy areas, and better identify and manage fragmentation, overlap, and duplication. Information architecture offers one approach to developing an inventory. As OMB determines a strategy for resuming implementation of the program inventory and develops its guidance, considering such a systematic approach to planning, organizing, and developing the inventory that centers on maximizing the use and usefulness of information could help ensure the inventory meets GPRAMA requirements and the needs of decision makers and the public. Additionally, such an approach could also help OMB implement our past recommendations related to the program inventory, which are intended to ensure the inventory provides more complete information and is useful to", "answers": ["Full implementation of GPRAMA could facilitate efforts to reform the federal government and make it more effective. GPRAMA includes a provision for GAO to review the act's implementation. This report assesses how GPRAMA implementation has affected the federal government's progress in resolving key governance challenges in (1) addressing cross-cutting issues, (2) ensuring performance information is useful and used, (3) aligning daily operations with results, and (4) building a more transparent and open government. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed statutory requirements, OMB guidance, and GAO's recent work related to GPRAMA implementation and the key governance challenges. GAO also interviewed OMB staff and surveyed a stratified random sample of 4,395 federal managers from 24 agencies on various performance and management topics. With a 67 percent response rate, the survey results are generalizable to the government-wide population of managers. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and agencies have made some progress in more fully implementing the GPRA Modernization Act (GPRAMA), but GAO's work and 2017 survey of federal managers highlight numerous areas where improvements are needed. Cross-cutting issues: Various GPRAMA provisions are aimed at addressing cross-cutting issues, such as cross-agency and agency priority goals and related data-driven reviews of progress towards those goals. To ensure alignment with the current administration's priorities, OMB's 2017 guidance removed the priority status of those goals, which stopped quarterly data-driven reviews and related public progress reports until new goals are published. OMB plans to resume implementation of these provisions in February 2018. GPRAMA also requires OMB and agencies to implement an inventory of federal programs, which could help decision makers better identify and manage fragmentation, overlap, and duplication. OMB and agencies implemented the inventory once, in May 2013. In October 2014, GAO found several issues limited the usefulness of that inventory. Since then, OMB has postponed updating the inventory, citing among other reasons the passage of subsequent laws. OMB has yet to develop a systematic approach for resuming implementation of the inventory and specific time frames for doing so. A systematic approach to developing the inventory could help ensure it provides useful information for decision makers and the public. Performance information: Survey results show federal managers generally reported no improvements in their use of performance information in decision making for various management activities, or practices that can enhance such use, since GAO's 2013 survey. For example, the use of performance information to streamline programs to reduce duplicative activities (an estimated 33 percent in 2017) is statistically significantly lower relative to 2013 (44 percent). In contrast, managers who were familiar with and whose programs were subject to quarterly data-driven reviews reported that those reviews were used to make progress toward agency priority goals. Identifying and sharing practices to expand the use of such reviews—for other performance goals and at lower levels within agencies—could lead to increased use of performance information. Daily operations: Agencies have made progress in developing results-oriented cultures but need to take additional actions. GAO's past work found that high-performing organizations use performance management systems to help individuals connect their daily activities to organizational goals. In 2017, about half of federal managers reported using performance information when setting expectations with employees (no change from GAO's last survey in 2013). Transparent and open government: GAO's past work identified a number of needed improvements to Performance.gov, the central government-wide website required by GPRAMA. The site is to provide quarterly updates on priority goals in effect through September 2017, but those updates stopped in December 2016. According to OMB, the existing information for cross-agency priority goals is the final update, and agencies should publish final updates on their priority goals in annual performance reports. Performance.gov does not provide users with this information, thereby limiting the transparency and accessibility of those results.

The river is used primarily for agricultural irrigation and municipal and industrial (M&I) purposes, with 70% of basin water supplies used to irrigate 5.5 million acres of land. The river's flow and stored water also are important for power production, fish and wildlife, and recreation. The federal government's role in the management of the Colorado River is magnified by the multiple federally owned and operated water storage and conveyance facilities in the basin, which provide low-cost water and hydropower supplies to water users.

Pursuant to federal law, the Bureau of Reclamation (part of the Department of the Interior) manages much of the basin's water supplies. Colorado River water is used primarily for agricultural irrigation and municipal and industrial (M&I) uses, but it also is important for power production, fish and wildlife, and recreational uses. In recent years, consumptive uses of Colorado River water have exceeded natural flows. This causes an imbalance in the basin's available supplies and competing demands. A drought in the basin dating to 2000 has raised the prospect of water delivery curtailments and decreased hydropower production, among other things. In the future, observers expect that increasing demand for supplies, coupled with the effects of climate change, will further increase the strain on the basin's limited water supplies. River Management The Law of the River is the commonly used shorthand for the multiple laws, court decisions, and other documents governing Colorado River operations. The foundational document of the Law of the River is the Colorado River Compact of 1922. Pursuant to the compact, the basin states established a framework to apportion the water supplies between the Upper and Lower Basins of the Colorado River, with the dividing line between the two basins at Lee Ferry, AZ (near the Utah border). The Upper and Lower Basins each were allocated 7.5 million acre-feet (MAF) annually under the Colorado River Compact; an additional 1.5 MAF in annual flows was made available to Mexico under a 1944 treaty. Future agreements and court decisions addressed numerous other issues (including intrastate allocations of flows), and subsequent federal legislation provided authority and funding for federal facilities that allowed users to develop their allocations. A Supreme Court ruling also confirmed that Congress designated the Secretary of the Interior as the water master for the Lower Basin, a role in which the federal government manages the delivery of all water below Hoover Dam. Reclamation and basin stakeholders closely track the status of two large reservoirs—Lake Powell in the Upper Basin and Lake Mead in the Lower Basin—as an indicator of basin storage conditions. Under recent guidelines, dam releases from these facilities are tied to specific water storage levels. For Lake Mead, the first tier of \"shortage,\" under which Arizona's and Nevada's allocations would be decreased, would be triggered if Lake Mead's January 1 elevation is expected to fall below 1,075 feet above mean sea level. As of early 2019, Reclamation projected that there was a 69% chance of a shortage condition at Lake Mead in 2020; there was also a lesser chance of Lake Powell reaching critically low levels. Improved hydrology in early 2019 may decrease the chances of shortage in the immediate future. Drought Contingency Plans Despite previous efforts to alleviate future shortages, the basin's hydrological outlook has generally worsened in recent years. After several years of negotiations, in early 2019 Reclamation and the basin states transmitted to Congress additional plans to alleviate stress on basin water supplies. These plans, known as the drought contingency plans (DCPs) for the Upper and Lower Basins, were authorized by Congress in April 2019 in the Colorado River Drought Contingency Plan Authorization Act (P.L. 116-14). The DCPs among other things obligate Lower Basin states to additional water supply cutbacks at specified storage levels (i.e., cutbacks beyond previous curtailment plans), commit Reclamation to additional water conservation efforts, and coordinate Upper Basin operations to protect Lake Powell storage levels and hydropower generation. Congressional Role Congress plays a multifaceted role in federal management of the Colorado River basin. Congress funds and oversees management of basin facilities, including operations and programs to protect and restore endangered species. It has also enacted and continues to consider Indian water rights settlements involving Colorado River waters and development of new water storage facilities in the basin. In addition, Congress has approved funding to mitigate water shortages and conserve basin water supplies and has enacted new authorities to combat drought and its effects on basin water users (i.e., the DCPs and other related efforts)."], "all_classes": null, "length": 7367}
{"pred": " The report discusses the sources of federal government revenue, including user fees, fines, and penalties. In fiscal year 2017, the total federal receipts were $3.3 trillion, with over $350 billion collected from fees, fines, penalties, and forfeitures. User fees are charges for goods or services provided by the federal government, such as fees to enter a national park, and charges assessed for regulatory services, such as fees charged by the Food and Drug Administration for prescription drug applications. Fees are an approach to financing federal programs or activities that, in general, are related to some voluntary transaction or request for government services above and beyond what is normally available to the public. By requiring identifiable beneficiaries to pay all or part of the cost of a good or service, fees can promote both equity and economic efficiency. Regularly reviewing fees help ensure that agencies, Congress, and stakeholders have complete information. Fines and penalties: Criminal fines and penalty payments are imposed by courts as punishment for criminal violations. Civil monetary penalties are not a result of criminal proceedings but are employed by courts and federal agencies to enforce federal laws and regulations. For example, civil monetary penalty payments are collected from financial institutions by certain financial regulators, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, from enforcement actions assessed against financial institutions for violations related to anti-money laundering requirements. Reviews and, as needed, adjustments to fines and penalties could help ensure they provide a meaningful incentive for compliance. The design and structure of statutory authorities for fees, fines, and penalties can vary widely. In prior work, we have identified key design decisions related to how fee, fine, and penalty collections are used that help Congress balance agency flexibility with congressional control and oversight. Congress determines the availability of collections by defining the extent to which an agency may obligate and expend them, including the availability of the funds, the period of time the collections are available for obligation, the purposes for which they may be obligated, and the amount of the collections that are available to the agency. Fees, fines, and penalties may be categorized as one of three types of collections based on the structure of their statutory authority: offsetting collections, offsetting receipts, or governmental receipts. Offsetting collections can provide agencies with more flexibility because they are generally available for agency obligation without an additional annual appropriation. In contrast, offsetting receipts and governmental receipts involve greater congressional opportunities for control and oversight because, generally, additional congressional action is needed before the collections are available for agency obligation. The type of collection also determines how OMB and Treasury report", "answers": ["Congress has authorized federal agencies to collect hundreds of billions of dollars annually in fees, fines, and penalties. These collections can fund a variety of programs, including programs related to national security, and the protection of natural resources. Data on collections are important for congressional oversight and to provide transparency in agencies' use of federal resources. GAO was asked to review the availability of government-wide data on fees, fines, and penalties. This report examines (1) the extent to which data on collections of fees, fines, and penalties are publically available and useful for the purpose of congressional oversight; and (2) the benefits and challenges to government-wide reporting of fees, fines, and penalties. GAO assessed government-wide fee, fine, and penalty data against criteria for availability and usefulness based on multiple sources, including prior GAO work and input from staff of selected congressional committees. GAO interviewed OMB staff, Treasury officials, and representatives of organizations with expertise in federal budget issues and reviewed prior GAO work to identify benefits and challenges of reporting these data. There are no comprehensive, government-wide data at the level of detail that identifies specific fees, fines, or penalties. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) report data that include these collections at the budget account level, which generally covers a set of agency activities or programs. OMB and Treasury also report some summary data for budgeting and financial management purposes. In the Budget of the U.S. Government , for example, OMB data showed government-wide fees totaled just over $335 billion in fiscal year 2017. These reports, however, are not designed to inventory or analyze fee, fine, or penalty collections and have significant limitations for that purpose. Although OMB collects more disaggregated data on fees, fines, and penalties, it does not make the data publicly available. OMB uses the disaggregated data in its OMB MAX database—such as the agency and account—to compile reported totals, such as the government-wide fees total in the Budget of the U.S. Government . Until OMB makes more disaggregated data publicly available, Congress has limited information on collections by agency to inform oversight and decision-making. OMB's government-wide total of fees includes collections that are not fees and excludes some fee collections. The total includes all collections for accounts in which fees make up at least half of the account's collections and excludes all others. OMB does not direct agencies to regularly review and update the accounts included in the total. Therefore, if accounts' makeups change such that fee collections drop below, or rise above, the 50 percent threshold, accounts may have incorrect fee designations and the total may be inaccurate. Further, OMB does not disclose the limitation that the total may exclude some fees and include other collections that are not fees. As a result, some users of the data are likely unaware of the potential for the total fees to be overestimated or underestimated. Further, no source of government-wide data consistently reports data elements on fees, fines, and penalties that could help inform congressional oversight. Generally, congressional staff told us that additional data, such as amounts of specific penalties, would increase transparency and facilitate oversight. These data could help Congress identify trends in collections and significant changes that could be an indication of an agency's performance. While reporting government-wide fee, fine, and penalty data provides benefits, there are trade-offs in terms of the time and federal resources it would take to develop and implement a process for agencies to report these data. The level of federal investment would vary depending on factors, such as the number of data elements included and the level of detail reported. Developing a comprehensive and accessible data source would provide greater benefits, but would likely be resource intensive. Alternatively, incorporating a small number of data elements that Congress identifies as most useful for oversight into ongoing government-wide reporting efforts could incrementally improve transparency and information for oversight and decision-making, with fewer resources.

This program, authorized by Section 7(a) of the Small Business Act of 1953 (as amended), aims to provide small businesses with access to capital and credit, particularly those that might not otherwise obtain financing on reasonable terms and conditions. The 7(a) program includes several subprograms, such as SBAExpress, Export Express, and Community Advantage, which offer streamlined and expedited loan procedures for specific groups of borrowers. These subprograms have their own eligibility requirements, terms, and benefits, but operate under the 7(a) program's authorization. The SBA's 7(a) loans can be used for various purposes, including establishing a new business, acquiring land, constructing buildings, purchasing equipment, financing working capital, and refinancing debts. In FY2018, the SBA approved 60,353 7(a) loans totaling nearly $25.4 billion, with an average loan amount of $420,401. The number and amount of 7(a) loans approved have fluctuated over the years, with a decline in FY2008 and FY2009, an increase in FY2010 and FY2011, and a gradual rise since then. The SBA's loan programs are designed to help small businesses that face challenges in accessing capital, particularly minority and women-owned businesses.

The program provides free meals to children aged 18 and under in low-income areas during periods when school is not in session, primarily during the summer months. It also operates during school vacation periods in any month for programs operating on a continuous school calendar and in certain other times for areas affected by an unanticipated school closure, such as for a natural disaster. The SFSP is administered at the federal level by the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) through its national and regional offices. FNS is responsible for issuing regulations, instructions, and guidance; reviewing states’ program management and administration plans; overseeing program administration; and reimbursing states for meals served that meet program requirements. At the state level, the program is administered by state agencies and locally operated by state-approved sponsors, such as school districts, local government entities, or private nonprofit organizations. State agencies are responsible for approving, providing training to, and inspecting and monitoring sponsors and meal sites. Sponsors, in turn, are responsible for monitoring their SFSP meal sites, managing the meal service, and providing training to administrative staff and site operators. A sponsor may operate one site or multiple sites. Sites are physical locations in the community where children receive and consume meals in a supervised setting. According to FNS guidance, sites may be located in a variety of settings, including schools, parks, community centers, health clinics, hospitals, apartment complexes, churches, and migrant camps. States may approve different types of SFSP meal sites, including open sites, closed enrolled sites, and camps. Open sites operate in an area where at least half of the children are eligible for free or reduced-price school meals (referred to as “area eligible”), according to data from entities such as schools or the U.S. Census Bureau. Children are generally eligible for free or reduced-price school meals if their households have incomes at or below 185 percent of federal poverty guidelines. At open sites, meals are made available to all children in the area, and all meals served that meet program requirements are reimbursable. Closed enrolled sites, on the other hand, are open only to enrolled children, as opposed to the community at large.

In the last decade, federal expenditures for SFSP have increased as the program has expanded, according to USDA data. GAO was asked to review the SFSP. This report examines (1) what is known about SFSP participation, (2) other programs that help feed low-income children over the summer, and (3) challenges, if any, in providing summer meals to children and the extent to which USDA provides assistance to address these challenges. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed USDA's SFSP data for fiscal years 2007 through 2016; surveyed state agencies responsible for administering the SFSP in 50 states and the District of Columbia; visited a nongeneralizable group of 3 states and 30 meal sites, selected based on Census data on child poverty rates and urban and rural locations; analyzed meal site data from the 3 states; and interviewed USDA, state and national organization officials, and SFSP providers, including sponsors and site operators. Nationwide, the total number of meals served to children in low-income areas through the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) increased from 113 to 149 million (about 32 percent) from fiscal year 2007 through 2016. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) directs states to use the number of meals served, along with other data, to estimate the number of children participating in the SFSP. However, participation estimates have been calculated inconsistently from state to state and year to year. In 2017, USDA took steps to improve the consistency of participation estimates, noting they are critical for informing program implementation and strategic planning. However, GAO determined that the method USDA directs states to use will continue to provide unreliable estimates of participation, hindering USDA's ability to use them for these purposes. Other federal and nonfederal programs help feed low-income children over the summer to some extent, according to states GAO surveyed and SFSP providers and others GAO interviewed. For example, in July 2016, USDA data indicate about 26 million meals were served through a separate federal program that allows school meal providers to serve summer meals. Some children also received summer meals through nonfederal programs operated by faith-based organizations and foodbanks, though GAO's state survey and interviews with providers and national organizations indicate the reach of such efforts is limited. States and SFSP providers reported challenges with meal sites, participation, and program administration; USDA has taken steps to address these areas. Specifically, in GAO's survey, a majority of states reported challenges with availability and awareness of meal sites, as well as limited program participation and administrative capacity. National, state, and local officials have taken steps to address these issues, such as increasing outreach and offering activities to attract participation. In addition, 17 states in GAO's survey and providers in the states GAO visited reported a challenge with ensuring meal sites are in safe locations. To address this safety issue, USDA has granted some states and sponsors flexibility from the requirement that children consume meals on-site. However, USDA has not broadly communicated the circumstances it considers when granting this flexibility. Further, some states and sponsors that have requested this flexibility reported difficulty obtaining data to show these circumstances exist, hampering their ability to ensure safe meal delivery.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this Medicare report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is from a government agency, probably the GAO (Government Accountability Office), and it discusses Medicare's programs, their costs, fraud risks, and the agency's efforts to combat fraud.\n\nFirst, the report starts by explaining that Medicare is one of four principal health-insurance programs administered by CMS. It provides coverage for people aged 65 and over, certain individuals with disabilities, and those with end-stage renal disease. The report mentions that Medicare is the largest CMS program, costing $702 billion in fiscal year 2017, and that outlays are projected to rise to $1.5 trillion by 2028. So, the program is massive in terms of funding and expected growth.\n\nThen, the report talks about fraud in Medicare. It defines fraud as obtaining something of value through willful misrepresentation. However, the report states that there are no reliable estimates of the extent of fraud in Medicare or the healthcare industry as a whole. This is because fraud is hard to detect, as those involved are intentionally deceiving. Also, potential fraud cases must be identified, investigated, prosecuted, and adjudicated before fraud can be established. \n\nThe report mentions that Medicare was designated a high-risk program in 1990 due to its size, scope, and complexity making it vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse. Similarly, the OMB designated all parts of Medicare as a \"high priority\" program because they each report $750 million or more in improper payments in a given year. The report also highlights challenges associated with duplicative payments in Medicare in their annual report on duplication and opportunities for cost savings in federal programs.\n\nThe report then discusses the challenges of improper payments in Medicare, which may include payments made as a result of fraud. However, it clarifies that improper payments are not a proxy for the amount of fraud or extent of fraud risk in a particular program as improper payment measurement does not specifically identify or estimate such payments due to fraud. So, improper payments are those that are either made in an incorrect amount (overpayments and underpayments) or those that should not have been made at all. \n\nThe report then moves on to discuss the CMS's efforts to combat fraud. It mentions that CMS has a program-integrity approach working with a broad array of stakeholders, including contractors, health-insurance plans, and law", "answers": ["Medicare covered over 58 million people in 2017 and has wide-ranging impact on the health-care sector and the overall U.S. economy. However, the billions of dollars in Medicare outlays as well as program complexity make it susceptible to improper payments, including fraud. Although there are no reliable estimates of fraud in Medicare, in fiscal year 2017 improper payments for Medicare were estimated at about $52 billion. Further, about $1.4 billion was returned to Medicare Trust Funds in fiscal year 2017 as a result of recoveries, fines, and asset forfeitures. In December 2017, GAO issued a report examining how CMS managed its fraud risks overall and particularly the extent to which its efforts in the Medicare and Medicaid programs aligned with GAO's Framework. This testimony, based on that report, discusses the extent to which CMS's management of fraud risks in Medicare aligns with the Framework. For the report, GAO reviewed CMS policies and interviewed officials and external stakeholders. In its December 2017 report, GAO found that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) antifraud efforts for Medicare partially align with GAO's 2015 A Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs (Framework). The Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015 required OMB to incorporate leading practices identified in this Framework in its guidance to agencies on addressing fraud risks. Consistent with the Framework, GAO determined that CMS had demonstrated commitment to combating fraud by creating a dedicated entity to lead antifraud efforts; the Center for Program Integrity (CPI) serves as this entity for fraud, waste, and abuse issues in Medicare. CMS also promoted an antifraud culture by, for example, coordinating with internal stakeholders to incorporate antifraud features into new program design. To increase awareness of fraud risks in Medicare, CMS offered and required training for stakeholder groups such as providers of medical services, but it did not offer or require similar fraud-awareness training for most of its workforce. CMS took some steps to identify fraud risks in Medicare; however, it had not conducted a fraud risk assessment or designed and implemented a risk-based antifraud strategy for Medicare as defined in the Framework. CMS identified fraud risks through control activities that target areas the agency designated as higher risk within Medicare, including specific provider types, such as home health agencies. Building on earlier steps and conducting a fraud risk assessment, consistent with the Framework, would provide the detailed information and insights needed to create a fraud risk profile, which, in turn, is the basis for creating an antifraud strategy. CMS established monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for its program-integrity control activities that, if aligned with an antifraud strategy, could enhance the effectiveness of fraud risk management in Medicare. For example, CMS used return-on-investment and savings estimates to measure the effectiveness of its Medicare program-integrity activities. In developing an antifraud strategy, consistent with the Framework, CMS could include plans for refining and building on existing methods such as return-on-investment, to evaluate the effectiveness of all of its antifraud efforts. In its December 2017 report, GAO made three recommendations, namely that CMS (1) require and provide fraud-awareness training to its employees; (2) conduct fraud risk assessments; and (3) create an antifraud strategy for Medicare, including an approach for evaluation. The Department of Health and Human Services agreed with these recommendations and reportedly is evaluating options to implement them.

It outlines the three main programs: Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI), Disability Insurance (DI), and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). The report provides financial figures for each program in fiscal year 2019, such as the amount of benefits paid and the number of beneficiaries. \n\nThen, the report discusses the SSA's reliance on IT resources to support the administration of its programs. It mentions the use of systems for handling transactions, maintaining records, and evaluating eligibility. The report also highlights challenges in managing IT, including weaknesses in system development practices, governance, and strategic planning. \n\nThe report mentions the SSA's Office of the Deputy Commissioner for Systems, which is responsible for developing, overseeing, and maintaining the agency's IT systems. The office has approximately 3,800 staff, and the Deputy Commissioner also serves as the agency's CIO. \n\nThe report notes that SSA has long been challenged in its management of IT, with previous reports highlighting various weaknesses in the agency's system development practices, governance, requirements management, and strategic planning. The report emphasizes the need for the agency to strengthen its IT management controls. \n\nThe report also discusses the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA), which was enacted in 2014 to improve agencies' acquisitions of IT and enable Congress to monitor agencies' progress and hold them accountable for reducing duplication and achieving cost savings. The report outlines specific requirements related to seven areas, including CIO authority enhancements, federal data center consolidation initiative, enhanced transparency and improved risk management, portfolio review, IT acquisition cadres, government-wide software purchasing program, and Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative. \n\nThe report mentions that in 2016, the SSA requested $132 million in its fiscal year 2019 budget to modernize its IT environment. The report discusses the various projects included in this modernization effort, such as updating database designs by converting them to relational databases, eliminating the use of outdated code, and upgrading infrastructure. \n\nThe report also highlights the challenges faced by the SSA in its Disability Case Processing System, which has been under development since December 20", "answers": ["SSA delivers services that touch the lives of almost every American, and relies heavily on IT resources to do so.

GAO has previously reported that federal IT projects have often failed, in part, due to a lack of oversight and governance. Given the challenges that federal agencies, including SSA, have encountered in managing IT acquisitions, Congress and the administration have taken steps to improve federal IT, including enacting federal IT acquisition reform legislation and issuing related guidance. This statement summarizes GAO's previously reported findings regarding SSA's management of IT acquisitions and operations. In developing this testimony, GAO summarized findings from its reports issued in 2011 through 2018, and information on SSA's actions in response to GAO's recommendations. The Social Security Administration (SSA) has improved its management of information technology (IT) acquisitions and operations by addressing 14 of the 15 recommendations that GAO has made to the agency. For example, Incremental development . The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has emphasized the need for agencies to deliver IT investments in smaller increments to reduce risk and deliver capabilities more quickly. In November 2017, GAO reported that agencies, including SSA, needed to improve their certification of incremental development. As a result, GAO recommended that SSA's CIO (1) report incremental development information accurately, and (2) update its incremental development policy and processes. SSA implemented both recommendations. Software licenses . Effective management of software licenses can help avoid purchasing too many licenses that result in unused software. In May 2014, GAO reported that most agencies, including SSA, lacked comprehensive software license policies. As a result, GAO made six recommendations to SSA, to include developing a comprehensive software licenses policy and inventory. SSA implemented all six recommendations. However, SSA's IT management policies have not fully addressed the role of its CIO. Various laws and related guidance assign IT management responsibilities to CIOs in six key areas. In August 2018, GAO reported that SSA had fully addressed the role of the CIO in one of the six areas (see table). Specifically, SSA's policies fully addressed the CIO's role in the IT leadership and accountability area by requiring the CIO to report directly to the agency head, among other things. In contrast, SSA's policies did not address or minimally addressed the IT workforce and IT strategic planning areas. For example, SSA's policies did not include requirements for the CIO to annually assess the extent to which personnel meet IT management skill requirements or to measure how well IT supports agency programs. GAO recommended that SSA address the weaknesses in the remaining five key areas. SSA agreed with GAO's recommendation and stated that the agency plans to implement the recommendation by the end of this month. GAO has made 15 recommendations to SSA to improve its management of IT acquisitions and operations from 2011 through 2018, and 1 recommendation to improve its CIO policies. While SSA has implemented nearly all of them, it would be better positioned to overcome longstanding IT management challenges when it addresses the CIO's role in its policies."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3733}
{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1.5 line spacing)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report to understand the main points. The report is about federal user fees, how they're collected, their purposes, advantages, and some concerns.\n\nFirst, the report explains that the federal government collects various fees from businesses and households. These fees are used to fund different activities, such as maintaining national parks through entry fees. Some fees are related to regulatory or judicial activities, like filing fees. Others are internal transactions between federal agencies, like the Office of Personnel Management charging other agencies for background investigations.\n\nThe report mentions that some agencies rely heavily on user fees, like the SEC, FERC, PTO, and FTC. In FY2017, user fees accounted for $331 billion, which is about a tenth of total federal receipts. These fees are voluntary, so not paying them might prevent certain activities, like getting a passport or filing a security offering.\n\nThe report also discusses the administrative and economic consequences of using fees versus taxes. For example, fees can be more flexible, but they might not be as stable during economic downturns. There are also concerns about Congress's oversight being bypassed if agencies use user fees.\n\nThe report goes into detail about the definitions of user fees, how they are categorized, and the budgetary processes involved. It mentions that user fees can be classified as discretionary or mandatory, depending on the authorization. Some argue that relying on user fees might shift priorities towards those paying, away from the broader public interest.\n\nThe report also touches on the economic efficiency of user fees, the benefit principle, and how they relate to Pigou taxation. It discusses the challenges of linking fees to the actual costs of providing benefits, especially when demand is irregular. The report also mentions the importance of budgetary oversight and the potential for policy changes to affect the efficiency of user fees.\n\nThere are various concerns raised in the report, such as the potential for user fees to bypass regular congressional scrutiny, which could lead to a dilution of Congress's power of the purse. The report also discusses the complexities of budgetary reporting, the need for more detailed data, and the potential for new pressures on the congressional appropriations process.\n\nIn terms of recommendations, the report suggests that Congress could modify laws governing the President's budget submission to require OMB to release data on which budget accounts receive material amounts of user fee and user charge revenues.", "answers": ["The federal government collects various fees from businesses and households. Choosing to raise public funds via user fees, as opposed to other means such as taxes, has important administrative and economic consequences. Many fees stem from \"business-like activities,\" in which the government provides a service or benefit in return for payment. For example, many national parks charge entry fees, which then help fund maintenance projects. Such fees and charges that result from voluntary choices, such as entering a national park, are distinguished from taxes—which stem from the government's sovereign power to compel payments. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) defines a user fee as a \"fee assessed to users for goods or services provided by the federal government. User fees generally apply to federal programs or activities that provide special benefits to identifiable recipients above and beyond what is normally available to the public.\" User fees and charges have several advantages as a means of financing public activities. They are voluntary, they connect the burden of financing activities to those who directly benefit from them, and can help decentralize decisionmaking by bypassing centralized allocation of resources. Some have expressed concerns that user fee arrangements may bypass regular congressional scrutiny and dilute Congress's power of the purse. Collections of fees and charges may also be more sensitive to economic fluctuations, which could complicate financing of programs dependent on those revenue streams. Many user fees or charges are classified as offsetting collections, which are deposited into expenditure accounts. Offsetting collections can be used to offset agency spending and typically require no further congressional approval to use. Other fees and charges are classified as offsetting receipts, which are collected into revenue accounts and typically require congressional authorization to be spent. User fees and charges can be classified as discretionary or mandatory spending, depending on how they are legally authorized. The levels and administration of some fees are specified in detailed statutory text, while other fees are created under broader agency authorities. Certain agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have increased their reliance on user fees in past decades. Some critics have raised concerns that increased reliance on user fees could shift incentives facing those agencies. Some legislative proposals, such as H.R. 850 introduced in the 115th Congress, would limit or eliminate most exceptions and require most fees and charges to be deposited in the U.S. Treasury General Fund. Congress could fund agencies and activities now funded in whole or in part via user fees directly through the annual appropriations process. Such proposals would mark a departure from past practice. Statutory text governing many fees has evolved over many years and involves substantive policy decisions, often related to the industry or programmatic concerns. A general change in funding from user fees and charges to annual appropriations would likely shift the division of responsibilities between authorizing committees and appropriations committees. Congress may also enhance its oversight of agencies reliant on user fees by requiring more timely and detailed financial reports as well as more precise and systematic explanations of linkages between those fees and associated programs. Congress could also ask for greater transparency in fiscal data. While the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the U.S. Treasury Bureau of the Fiscal Service provide extensive data on user fees and charges, it is difficult to conduct governmentwide analyses using publicly available sources. Congress could mandate more detailed and more easily accessed data on user fees and charges. Additional funding may be needed to develop the capacity to issue those data."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4022}
{"pred": " (One page)\nThe report discusses the legal framework and historical context of military base closures and realignments in the United States. It begins by explaining the constitutional basis for military operations, noting that while the President is the commander-in-chief, Congress holds the authority to raise armies, maintain a Navy, and regulate the militia. The report highlights the historical practice of the President having broad authority to open, close, or realign military installations, with Congress largely deferring to the Executive branch. This was primarily because the President, as commander-in-chief, is empowered with the responsibility of deploying military forces. However, the report notes that the President's ability to close or realign major military installations was effectively limited by the passage of 10 U.S.C. 2687 in 1977. This statute, later codified as 10 U.S.C. 2687 (Section 612 of the Military Construction Authorization Act of 1978, P.L. 95-82 ), generally required DOD to conduct comprehensive and lengthy assessments of major basing decisions as part of a congressional report-and-wait process. These assessments could be challenged in court on environmental grounds or on questions related to their sufficiency, further lengthening delays. The new legislation effectively halted DOD's ability to close or realign domestic bases of significant size. In the decade that followed the passage of 10 U.S.C. 2687, congressional pressure grew to accommodate DOD basing priorities. By 1988, ongoing negotiations between the Secretary of Defense and the House and Senate Armed Service Committees led to new legislation ( P.L. 100-526 ) that authorized a limited number of base closures based on the oversight of an independent panel. Though later modified, the effort marked the beginning of the first Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process, which was intended to insulate base closings from considerations such as favoritism or other political interference. The report details the evolution of the BRAC process, including the establishment of an independent commission with the authority to evaluate and recommend closure or realignment actions. The process has required the Secretary of Defense to submit a list of military installations recommended for closure or realignment to an independent, bipartisan BRAC commission. After analyzing the Secretary's recommendations, the commission may accept, reject, or modify the list. Upon completing its review, the commission forwards its final findings and recommendations to the President. Upon", "answers": ["Since 1977, statutory thresholds have effectively constrained the President's ability to close or realign major military installations in the United States. Congress has instead periodically granted temporary authorities—known as a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC)—that have established independent commissions for the review and approval of basing changes submitted by the Secretary of Defense. These unique and transient authorities last expired on April 16, 2006. There have been five rounds of base closures: 1988, 1991, 1993, 1995, and 2005. Though Congress has periodically adjusted the BRAC process to account for lessons learned, the modern framework has remained generally consistent with earlier rounds, and includes establishment of an independent commission; reliance on objective and uniform criteria; Government Accountability Office (GAO) review and certification of Department of Defense (DOD) data; deliberations designed to be transparent that include open hearings, solicitation of feedback, installation visits, and data available for public review; and requirement that the final list of closure and realignment recommendations be accepted or rejected in their entirety. Congress has defined BRAC selection criteria in statute, thus requiring the Secretary to prioritize military value over cost savings. Additionally, Congress has required the Secretary to align the Department's recommendations with a comprehensive 20-year force structure plan. The commission may modify, reject, or add recommendations during its review before forwarding a final list to the President. After receiving the Commission's list of recommendations, the President may either accept the report in its entirety or seek to modify it by indicating disapproval and returning it to the commission for further evaluation. If the President accepts the commission's recommendations, they are forwarded to Congress. BRAC implementation begins by default unless Congress rejects the recommendations in their entirety within 45 days by enacting a joint resolution. During the implementation phase, DOD is required to initiate closures and realignments within two years and complete all actions within six years. The BRAC process represents a legislative compromise between the executive and legislative branches wherein each shares power in managing the closure and realignment of military bases. The imposition of an independent, third-party mediator was intended to insulate base closings from political considerations by both branches that had complicated similar actions in the past. This report provides background on the development of BRAC, describes its major elements and milestones, and outlines issues frequently cited in the context of new rounds, such as potential savings."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5035}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about Title IV of the Higher Education Act. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points.\n\nThe report explains that Title IV authorizes financial aid programs for students attending certain institutions. In 2016-2017, there were 6,760 Title IV eligible institutions. Of these, 29.4% were public, 27.8% private nonprofit, and 42.9% proprietary. The report mentions that $122.5 billion was available through Title IV in FY2017. To receive this aid, students must attend an eligible institution. \n\nThe report then goes into detail about the program integrity triad: state authorization, accreditation, and ED certification. Each of these components has its own purpose. State authorization ensures that an institution is legally allowed to operate in the state where it is located. Accreditation by an ED-recognized agency ensures that the education provided meets quality standards. ED's role is to certify the institution's eligibility and ensure compliance with additional requirements.\n\nThe report also discusses the definitions of institutions of higher education under Section 101 and Section 102 of the HEA. Section 101 applies to non-Title IV programs, while Section 102 is for Title IV participation. The definitions include public, private nonprofit, and proprietary institutions. Each has specific criteria, like state authorization, accreditation, and meeting financial ratios.\n\nProprietary institutions must meet additional requirements, such as the 90/10 rule, which states that at least 10% of their revenue comes from non-Title IV sources. The report also covers other eligibility criteria, such as the types of programs offered, student enrollment, and the length of academic programs. \n\nThe program integrity triad is designed to ensure that institutions meet quality standards and that students are protected. The triad includes state authorization, accreditation by an ED-recognized agency, and ED certification. The federal government's role is to ensure that institutions meet financial and administrative requirements for Title IV programs.\n\nThe report also discusses the 50% rules related to correspondence courses and distance education. These rules state that an institution is ineligible for Title IV participation if more than 50% of its courses are offered by correspondence, or if more than 50% of its students are enrolled in correspondence courses. These rules are part of the distance education section of", "answers": ["Title IV of the Higher Education Act (HEA) authorizes programs that provide financial assistance to students to assist them in obtaining a postsecondary education at certain institutions of higher education (IHEs). These IHEs include public, private nonprofit, and proprietary institutions. For students attending such institutions to be able to receive Title IV assistance, an institution must meet basic criteria, including offering at least one eligible program of education (e.g., programs leading to a degree or preparing a student for gainful employment in a recognized occupation). In addition, an IHE must satisfy the program integrity triad, under which it must be licensed or otherwise legally authorized to operate in the state in which it is physically located, accredited or preaccredited by an agency recognized for that purpose by the Department of Education (ED), and certified by ED as eligible to participate in Title IV programs. These requirements are intended to provide a balance between consumer protection, quality assurance, and oversight and compliance in postsecondary education providers participating in Title IV student aid programs. An IHE must also fulfill a variety of other related requirements, including those that relate to institutional recruiting practices, student policies and procedures, and the administration of the Title IV student aid programs. Finally, additional criteria may apply to an institution depending on its control or the type of educational programs it offers. For example, proprietary institutions must meet HEA requirements that are otherwise inapplicable to public and private nonprofit institutions, including deriving at least 10% of their revenues from non-Title IV funds (also known as the 90/10 rule).

{"pred": " The report provides an overview of Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD), its potential impact on the United States, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) approach to responding to an outbreak. FMD is a highly contagious viral disease that causes fever and painful lesions on cloven-hoofed animals' hooves, mouths, and udders. While FMD does not infect humans and is not considered a public health or food safety threat, it can lead to severe productivity losses, particularly in young animals. The disease can spread from one animal species to another, and the virus can survive in the environment for many months. FMD can be introduced into the U.S. from countries in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, or South America where it is present. The U.S. is vulnerable to FMD transmission due to the large size and mobility of the U.S. livestock sector. In 2018, the United States had about 94 million head of cattle, 74 million swine, 5 million sheep, and more than 2 million goats. Many of these livestock are concentrated in major livestock-producing states such as Texas and Iowa, but livestock are present in every state. According to USDA documents, a large percentage of livestock in the United States are kept on large farms, ranches, or feedlots (i.e., areas or buildings where livestock are fed and fattened up), some with capacity for 50,000 to 100,000 or more animals. Livestock are transported daily to feeding facilities, markets, slaughter plants, and other farms or ranches. For example, swine are often moved among multiple premises at different stages of their life spans to accommodate their growth in size, among other things. According to the swine industry, approximately 1 million swine are on the road every day in transit to various stages of the production process. An FMD outbreak in the United States could have serious economic consequences. A 2001 outbreak of FMD in the United Kingdom, for example, resulted in the killing of more than 6 million animals, with direct costs of more than $3 billion to the public sector and more than $5 billion to the private sector. The extent of economic damage in the United States would depend primarily on the duration and geographic extent of the outbreak, the extent of trade disruptions, and how consumers reacted to the disease and associated control measures, according to USDA. In a large and long", "answers": ["FMD is a highly contagious viral disease that causes painful lesions on the hooves and mouths of some livestock, making it difficult for them to stand or eat, thus greatly reducing meat and milk production. The United States has not had an FMD outbreak since 1929, but FMD is present in much of the world. An FMD outbreak in the United States could have serious economic impacts, in part because trade partners would likely halt all imports of U.S. livestock and livestock products until the disease was eradicated. These imports were valued at more than $19 billion in 2017. GAO was asked to review USDA's efforts to prepare for an FMD outbreak. This report examines (1) USDA's planned approach for responding to an FMD outbreak; (2) challenges USDA would face in pursuing its response goals; and (3) how USDA identifies, prioritizes, and monitors corrective actions to mitigate the challenges. GAO observed a USDA FMD preparedness exercise; reviewed agency documents and nongeneralizable questionnaire responses from 29 respondents from federal and state government, livestock industries, and universities; and interviewed officials from federal and state governments and representatives of livestock industries and universities. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) planned approach for responding to an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) includes several strategies. These strategies generally rely on killing infected and susceptible animals, vaccinating uninfected animals, or a combination of both approaches. USDA would implement one or more of the strategies, depending on factors such as the outbreak's size and the resources available, according to agency documents. USDA would likely face significant challenges in pursuing its response goals of detecting, controlling, and containing FMD quickly; eradicating FMD while seeking to stabilize industry and the economy; and facilitating continuity of commerce in uninfected animals. GAO identified challenges in 11 areas—including allocating a limited supply of FMD vaccine—based on its review of USDA documents, responses to GAO's questionnaire, and interviews with agency officials and others with expertise on FMD. According to USDA, the agency may not have a sufficient supply of FMD vaccine to control more than a small outbreak because of limited resources to obtain vaccine. As shown below, the current vaccine supply would be sufficient to protect about 14 percent of Texas's cattle or about 4 percent of Iowa's swine; these states' cattle and swine populations are the nation's largest. The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 includes a provision to increase the FMD vaccine supply. USDA has identified dozens of corrective actions to mitigate the challenges of responding to an FMD outbreak, as called for in USDA procedures, but has not prioritized these corrective actions or monitored their completion, as also called for in its procedures. USDA has identified the corrective actions through exercises simulating FMD outbreaks, surveys, and lessons learned from other foreign animal disease outbreaks. However, USDA has not completed all of the corrective actions, including actions related to vaccination. Agency officials stated that they have not completed such corrective actions because they have been responding to outbreaks of other animal diseases and have limited resources. Without following agency procedures to prioritize and monitor corrective actions, USDA cannot ensure that it is allocating its resources to the most beneficial actions to prepare for a possible FMD outbreak. GAO is recommending that USDA follow its procedures to prioritize and monitor the completion of corrective actions that the agency has identified for FMD preparedness. USDA agreed with these recommendations, and described actions it will take to implement them."], "all_classes": null, "length": 11771}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is about opioid use disorders and the efforts to expand access to Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) through various federal programs and initiatives.\n\nFirst, the report explains what opioids are and their effects on the body. It mentions that opioids are prescribed for pain and other conditions, and they can be misused, leading to addiction and death. The report also talks about the potential for diversion for illegal purposes, such as nonmedical use or financial gain.\n\nThen there's a section on MAT, which combines behavioral therapy and certain medications. The three medications approved by the FDA are methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone. Each of these has different properties and uses. Methadone is a full opioid agonist, which helps prevent withdrawal symptoms and reduce cravings. It's used in OTPs. Buprenorphine is a partial agonist, which reduces or eliminates withdrawal symptoms and cravings. It can be prescribed by qualified practitioners with a waiver. Naltrexone is an antagonist, which blocks the euphoria from opioids and causes withdrawal if recent use has occurred. \n\nThe report also discusses the potential for misuse of methadone and buprenorphine, which are controlled substances. It mentions that under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), treatment involving these medications can take place in certain authorized settings, such as OTPs or other settings with restrictions. \n\nThere's a part about the different formulations of these medications, like immediate or extended release, and their availability in pill, liquid, or patch form. The report also mentions that MAT can be more effective in reducing opioid use and increasing retention compared to abstinence-based treatment. \n\nThen there are sections on the specific medications and their uses. Methadone is used for detoxification and maintenance therapy. Buprenorphine is used for detoxification and maintenance therapy. Naltrexone is used for relapse prevention after complete detoxification. \n\nThe report also covers the federal efforts to expand access to MAT through various grant programs. For example, the Targeted Capacity Expansion: Medication Assisted Treatment – Prescription Drug and Opioid Addiction (MAT-PDOA) grant program, which provides funding to states to increase their capacity to provide MAT and recovery support services. The report also mentions other efforts, such as the Substance Abuse Service Expansion Supplement to Health Centers and the Increasing Access", "answers": ["The misuse of prescription opioid pain relievers and illicit opioids, such as heroin, has contributed to increases in overdose deaths. According to the most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, in 2015 over 52,000 people died of drug overdose deaths, and about 63 percent of them involved an opioid. For those who are addicted to or misuse opioids, MAT has been shown to be an effective treatment. GAO was asked to review HHS and other efforts related to MAT for opioid use disorders. This report (1) describes HHS's key efforts to expand access to MAT, (2) examines HHS's evaluation, if any, of its efforts to expand access to MAT, and (3) describes efforts by selected stakeholders (states, private health insurers, and national associations) to expand access to MAT. GAO gathered information from HHS officials as well as a non-generalizable selection of 15 stakeholders selected based on their MAT expansion activities, among other factors. GAO also assessed HHS's evaluation plans using internal control standards for defining objectives and evaluating results. In an effort to reduce the prevalence of opioid misuse and the fatalities associated with it, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) established a goal to expand access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT). MAT is an approach that combines behavioral therapy and the use of certain medications, such as methadone and buprenorphine. HHS has implemented five key efforts since 2015 that focus on expanding access to MAT for opioid use disorders—four grant programs that focus on expanding access to MAT in various settings (including rural primary care practices and health centers) and regulatory changes that expand treatment capacity by increasing patient limits for buprenorphine prescribers and allowing nurse practitioners and physician assistants to prescribe buprenorphine. Some of the grant awards were made in 2015, while others were made as recently as May 2017. (See figure.) As of August 2017, efforts under all the grant programs were ongoing. Grant recipients can use funding to undertake a range of activities, such as hiring and training providers and supporting treatments involving MAT. In addition, certain providers and grant recipients are required to develop plans for preventing MAT medications from being diverted for nonmedical purposes. HHS officials told GAO that as of August 2017, the department was in the process of finalizing its plans to evaluate its efforts to address the opioid epidemic. In September 2016, HHS awarded a contract to conduct the evaluation. HHS officials told GAO that they are still working with the contractor to finalize the evaluation approach and that it will focus on whether HHS's efforts to address the opioid epidemic have been implemented as intended. HHS officials said that in the future, HHS may also evaluate whether, or to what extent, its efforts have been effective in expanding access to MAT, in addition to evaluating implementation. While HHS has some of the information that could be used in a future evaluation of the effectiveness of its efforts to expand access to MAT, it has not adopted specific performance measures with targets specifying the magnitude of the increases HHS hopes to achieve through its efforts to expand access to MAT, and by when. For example, HHS has not established a long-term target specifying the percentage increase in the number of prescriptions for buprenorphine HHS would like to achieve, which would help to show whether efforts by HHS and others are resulting in a sufficient number of prescriptions for MAT medications. HHS has also not chosen a specific method of measuring treatment capacity or established targets associated with it, which would help determine whether a sufficient number of providers are becoming available to evaluate and treat patients who may benefit from MAT. Without specifying these performance measures and associated targets, HHS will not have an effective means to determine whether its efforts are helping to expand access to MAT or whether new approaches are needed. Gauging this progress is particularly important given the large gap identified nationwide between the total number of individuals who could benefit from MAT and the limited number who can currently access it based on provider availability. In addition, GAO also found that as of August 2017, HHS had not finalized its approach for its planned evaluation activities, including timeframes. Without timeframes for the evaluation's activities, HHS increases the risk that the evaluation will not be completed as expeditiously as possible. In addition to HHS efforts to expand access to MAT, officials from selected states, private health insurers, and national associations reported using several efforts to expand patients' access to MAT for opioid use disorders. For example, several stakeholders provided GAO with the following examples of their efforts: States. State health officials from all five selected states have implemented or are planning approaches that focus on integrating the use of MAT into primary care, such as by providing services for centralized intake and initial management of patients or through telehealth that connects patients in rural areas with addiction specialists in a different location. Private health insurers. Three private health insurers reported removing prior authorization requirements for MAT medications so patients can avoid a waiting period before receiving the medications. National associations. Officials told GAO that they are conducting outreach and training for their members and developing tools and resource guides. For example, one association developed a road map with strategies that state policymakers can use to address the opioid epidemic, including strategies for reducing the stigma associated with MAT through educating the public and potential providers. GAO recommends that HHS take two actions: (1) establish performance measures with targets related to expanding access to MAT, and (2) establish timeframes for its evaluation of its efforts to expand access to MAT. HHS concurred with both recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5601}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about the Holman rule in the House of Representatives. Let me start by understanding the key points of the report.\n\nThe report explains the distinction between authorization (which sets up or modifies federal programs) and appropriations (which provide funding). The Holman rule is a House rule that prevents legislative provisions from being included in appropriation bills, except for those that reduce expenditures. This rule has evolved over time, with changes in its application and scope.\n\nThe origin of the Holman rule can be traced back to 1835 when the House debated the issue of delays in enacting appropriations due to the inclusion of \"debatable matters of another character, new laws which created long debates in both Houses.\" The suggestion was that the Committee on Ways and Means should \"strip the appropriation bills of every thing but were legitimate matters of appropriation.\" In the following Congress (25th Congress, 1837-1839), language was added to House rules stating that no appropriation would be reported in general appropriation bills, or be in order as an amendment thereto, for any expenditure not previously authorized by law. This rule was applied to exclude legislative provisions authorizing new expenditures, such as a case in 1838 when it was used to exclude an amendment that included a provision for refurnishing the White House. The rule was modified in 1876 to include provisions that reduce the number and salary of officers, or the compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury. The rule was further narrowed in 1983, and the current version is based on the 1983 changes. The Holman rule is not intended to limit Congress's lawmaking authority but rather provides a limited exception to the general prohibition in House rules against legislation in appropriation measures. The rule has been interpreted through various precedents, which have tended to incrementally narrow its application. For example, early precedents established that while it was not always necessary that a retrenchment specify the amount of a reduction of expenditures, it must appear as a necessary result of the legislation to be in order and that it is not sufficient that such reduction would probably (or would in the opinion of the chair) result therefrom. The rule is not applicable to funds other than those appropriated in the pending general appropriations bill. The Holman rule is intended to apply only when an obvious reduction of funds in a general appropriations bill is achieved by the provision in question, such", "answers": ["Although congressional rules establish a general division of responsibility under which questions of policy are kept separate from questions of funding, House rules provide for exceptions in certain circumstances. One such circumstance allows for the inclusion of legislative language in general appropriations bills or amendments thereto for \"germane provisions that retrench expenditures by the reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill.\" This exception appears in clause 2(b) of House Rule XXI and is known as the Holman rule, after Representative William Holman of Indiana, who first proposed the exception in 1876. Since the period immediately after its initial adoption, the House has interpreted the Holman rule through precedents that have tended to incrementally narrow its application. Under current precedents, for a legislative provision or amendment to be in order, the legislative language in question must be both germane to other provisions in the measure and must produce a clear reduction of appropriations in that bill. In addition, the House adopted a separate order during the 115th Congress that provided for retrenchments of expenditures by a reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill to be construed as applying to: any provision or amendment that retrenches expenditures by— (1) the reduction of amounts of money in the bill; (2) the reduction of the number and salary of the officers of the United States; or (3) the reduction of the compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury of the United States.

It references historical figures like Huckleberry Finn and Davy Crockett who fled their abusive fathers. However, today's youth who run away often face more negative outcomes, such as being vulnerable to high-risk behaviors, further victimization, and being removed from school and support systems. The report also highlights that these youth may suffer from untreated mental health disorders, drug use, and sexual exploitation. They also report other challenges including poor health and lack of basic provisions.\n\nThe report then talks about the history of federal policies related to these youth. It starts with the 1970s when Congress began to hear concerns about the vulnerabilities of the runaway population due to increased awareness about these youth and the establishment of runaway shelters to assist them in returning home. Congress and the President went on to enact the Runaway Youth Act of 1974 as Title III of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (P.L. 93-415) to assist runaways through services specifically for this population. Since that time, the law has been updated to authorize services to provide support for runaway and homeless youth outside of the juvenile justice, mental health, and child welfare systems. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act—now known as the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act—authorized federal funding to be provided through annual appropriations for three programs that assist runaway and homeless youth: the Basic Center Program (BCP), Transitional Living Program (TLP), and Street Outreach Program (SOP). Together, the programs make up the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program (RHYP), administered by the Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB) in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Administration for Children and Families (ACF).\n\nThe report outlines the challenges in defining and counting this population, as well as the factors that influence homelessness and leaving home. It provides background on federal efforts to support these youth, including the evolution of federal policies to respond to these youth, with a focus on the period from the Runaway Youth Act of 1974 to the present time. The report then describes the administration and funding of the Basic Center", "answers": ["This report discusses runaway and homeless youth, and the federal response to support this population. There is no single definition of the terms \"runaway youth\" or \"homeless youth.\" However, both groups of youth share the risk of not having adequate shelter and other provisions, and may engage in harmful behaviors while away from a permanent home. Youth most often cite family conflict as the major reason for their homelessness or episodes of running away. A youth's sexual orientation, sexual activity, school problems, and substance abuse are associated with family discord. The precise number of homeless and runaway youth is unknown due to their residential mobility and overlap among the populations. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is supporting data collection efforts, known as Voices of Youth Count, to better determine the number of homeless youth. The 2017 study found that approximately 700,000 youth ages 13 to 17 and 3.5 million young adults ages 18 to 25 experienced homelessness within a 12-month period because they were sleeping in places not meant for habitation, in shelters, or with others while lacking alternative living arrangements. From the early 20th century through the 1960s, the needs of runaway and homeless youth were handled locally through the child welfare agency, juvenile justice courts, or both. The 1970s marked a shift toward federal oversight of programs that help youth who had run afoul of the law, including those who committed status offenses (i.e., a noncriminal act that is considered a violation of the law because of the youth's age). The Runaway Youth Act of 1974 was enacted as Title III of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (P.L. 93-415) to assist runaways through services specifically for this population. The act was amended over time to include homeless youth. It authorizes funding for services carried out under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program (RHYP), which is administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The program was most recently authorized through FY2020 by the Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-385). This law did not make other changes to the RHYP statute. Funding is discretionary, meaning provided through the appropriations process. FY2019 appropriations are $127.4 million. The RHYP program is made up of three components: the Basic Center Program (BCP), Transitional Living Program (TLP), and Street Outreach Program (SOP). The BCP provides temporary shelter, counseling, and after care services to runaway and homeless youth under age 18 and their families. In FY2017, the program served 23,288 youth, and in FY2018 it funded 280 BCP shelters (most recent figures available). The TLP is targeted to older youth ages 16 through 22 (and sometimes an older age). In FY2017, the TLP program served 3,517 youth, and in FY2018 it funded 299 grantees (most recent figures available). Youth who use the TLP receive longer-term housing with supportive services. The SOP provides education, treatment, counseling, and referrals for runaway, homeless, and street youth who have been subjected to, or are at risk of being subjected to, sexual abuse, sex exploitation, and trafficking. In FY2017, the SOP grantees made contact with 24,366 youth. The RHYP is a part of larger federal efforts to end youth homelessness through the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH). The USICH is a coordinating body made up of multiple federal agencies committed to addressing homelessness. The USICH's Opening Doors plan to end homelessness includes strategies for ending youth homelessness by 2020, including through collecting better data and supporting evidence-based practices to improve youth outcomes. Voices of Youth Count is continuing to report on characteristics of homeless youth. In addition to the RHYP, there are other federal supports to address youth homelessness. HUD's Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program is funding a range of housing options for youth, in selected urban and rural communities. Other federal programs have enabled homeless youth to access services, including those related to education and family violence."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8238}

Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points.\n\nThe report begins by explaining that these three agencies are funded through the CJS appropriations. It mentions that the FY2019 request was made before the full-year FY2018 appropriations were enacted. The FY2018 funding levels are based on the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, which provided specific amounts for each agency. The total for FY2018 was $648.3 million. Then, the FY2019 appropriations were $647.0 million, a 0.2% decrease from FY2018. \n\nThe President's FY2019 budget request was $590.8 million, which is an 8.9% decrease from the FY2018 appropriated amount. The request included reduced funding for all three agencies: ITA had $440.1 million (8.7% decrease), USITC had $87.6 million (6.5% decrease), and USTR had $63.0 million (13.2% decrease). However, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees largely rejected the Administration's budget cuts for these agencies. The final FY2019 appropriations were slightly less than FY2018, but the agencies operated under continuing resolutions for most of the year.\n\nThe report then goes into detail about each agency's budget. For ITA, the mission is to improve U.S. prosperity through trade and investment. The report mentions the organizational changes in 2013, which consolidated units into three: Global Markets, Industry and Analysis, and Enforcement and Compliance. The fourth unit is the Executive and Administrative Directorate. \n\nThe FY2019 budget request for ITA was $440.1 million, a decrease from the FY2018 amount. The Administration proposed increasing enforcement activities while reducing export promotion. They also wanted to close some offices. However, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees did not adopt these cuts. The final agreement provided funding that was slightly less than the FY2018 amount but more than the Administration's request. \n\nThe report also discusses the specific programs of each agency.

This represents a 0.2% decrease from FY2018 appropriations. For FY2019, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, included $484.0 million in direct appropriations for ITA (a 0.4% increase from the FY2018 appropriation), $95.0 million in funding for USITC (a 1.4% increase), and a total of $68.0 million for USTR (a 0.2% decrease). The Administration's Request On February 12, 2018, the Trump Administration submitted its FY2019 budget request to Congress. The FY2019 proposal included a total of $590.8 million for the three CJS trade-related agencies, an 8.9% decrease from FY2018 total appropriated amounts for these agencies. The Administration requested reducing funding for all three trade-related agencies. For FY2019, the request included $440.1 million in direct funding for ITA (an 8.7% decrease from the FY2018 appropriation), $87.6 million for USITC (a 6.5% decrease), and $63.0 million for USTR (a 13.2% decrease). Congressional Actions In the spring of 2018, the House and Senate reported FY2019 CJS appropriations bills, which included proposed funding for ITA, USITC, and USTR. The reported bills did not adopt many of the Administration's budget reductions, and instead proposed funding levels that were more similar to the FY2018-enacted amounts. The House Committee on Appropriations reported H.R. 5952 on May 17, 2018. The House proposal recommended a total of $647.6 million for the three CJS trade-related agencies. This proposal was $56.8 million more (9.6%) than the Administration's request, and $0.7 million less (-0.1%) than the FY2018-enacted legislation. The House committee proposed $480.0 million in direct funding for ITA, $95.0 million for USTIC, and a total of $72.6 million for USTR, comprised of $57.6 million for salaries and expenses and an additional $15.0 million from the Trade Enforcement Trust Fund for trade enforcement activities as authorized by the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-125). The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported S. 3072 on June 14, 2018. The Senate committee-reported proposal recommended a total of $655.6 million for the three CJS trade-related agencies. This is $64.8 million (11.0%) more than the Administration's request and $7.3 million (1.1%) more than the FY2018-enacted appropriations.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is about the fiscal outlook for state and local governments over the next 50 years. \n\nThe key findings are that the operating balance—the difference between current revenues and expenditures—is expected to remain negative. This is because expenditures are growing faster than revenues. The report mentions that both are projected to increase as a percentage of GDP, but the gap persists. \n\nThe simulations suggest that without policy changes, revenues will be insufficient to maintain current service levels. The fiscal gap is about 14.7% of total expenditures or 2.4% of GDP. This means that to close the gap, the sector would need to reduce expenditures by that amount or increase revenues. \n\nHealth care expenditures are a major driver of the fiscal gap. Medicaid spending is expected to rise, on average, by 1 percentage point more than GDP each year. This is due to both increased enrollment and higher per capita costs. The report also notes that health benefits for state and local government employees and retirees are projected to grow, contributing to the overall expenditure. \n\nOther factors include the growth of pension obligations. The report suggests that if historical relationships between pension assets and liabilities are maintained, the sector may need to take steps to manage these obligations. For example, if the rate of return on pension assets is lower, the required contributions could be higher. \n\nThe report also discusses the impact of federal policies, such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), on state and local government revenues. The TCJA has led to changes in how states collect taxes, and the report mentions that the SALT deduction is capped at $10,000. This could affect future tax revenues for states. \n\nAdditionally, the report highlights the potential impact of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, which allows states to collect sales taxes from out-of-state sellers. This could lead to increased sales tax revenue for states. \n\nThe report also mentions that state and local governments' capital outlays—spending on infrastructure like buildings, highways, and sewer systems—will grow more slowly than GDP if they continue to provide current levels of capital per resident. \n\nThe simulations also indicate that federal grants, particularly Medicaid grants, will likely grow more quickly than other types of federal grants. This is because Medicaid is a matching formula grant program, and the projected increase in Medicaid expenditures", "answers": ["Fiscal sustainability presents a national challenge shared by all levels of government. Since 2007, GAO has published simulations of long-term fiscal trends in the state and local government sector, which have consistently shown that the sector faces long-term fiscal pressures. While most states have requirements related to balancing their budgets, deficits can arise because the planned annual revenues are not generated at the expected rate, demand for services exceeds planned expenditures, or both, resulting in a near-term operating deficit. This report updates GAO's state and local fiscal model to simulate the fiscal outlook for the state and local government sector. This includes identifying the components of state and local expenditures likely to contribute to the sector's fiscal pressures. In addition, this report identifies considerations related to federal policy and other factors that could contribute to uncertainties in the state and local government sector's long-term fiscal outlook. GAO's model uses the Bureau of Economic Analysis's National Income and Product Accounts as the primary data source and presents the results in the aggregate for the state and local sector as a whole. The model shows the level of receipts and expenditures for the sector until 2067, based on current and historical spending and revenue patterns. In addition, the model assumes that the current set of policies in place across state and local government remains constant to show a simulated long-term outlook. GAO's simulations suggest that the state and local government sector will likely face an increasing difference between revenues and expenditures during the next 50 years as reflected by the operating balance--a measure of the sector's ability to cover its current expenditures out of its current receipts. While both expenditures and revenues are projected to increase as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), a difference between the two is projected to persist because expenditures are expected to grow faster than revenues throughout the simulation period. GAO's simulations also suggest that growth in the sector's overall spending is largely driven by health care expenditures--in particular, Medicaid spending and spending on health benefits for state and local government employees and retirees. These expenditures are projected to grow as a share of GDP during the simulation period. GAO's simulations also suggest that revenues from personal income taxes and federal grants to states and localities will increase during the simulation period. However, revenues will grow more slowly than expenditures such that the sector faces a declining fiscal outlook. GAO also identified federal policy changes that could affect the state and local government sector's fiscal outlook. For example, the effects of the recently-enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will likely depend on how states incorporate the Act into their state income tax rules. In addition, other factors, such as economic growth and rates of return on pension assets, could shift future fiscal outcomes for the sector."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8477}

Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points.\n\nThe report begins by referencing a law from 1986 that outlines the Marine Corps' role in amphibious and land operations. It mentions the need for equipment to conduct these operations, which led to the development of the ACV and MPC. The EFV program was canceled in 2011 due to cost overruns and poor performance, prompting the Pentagon to develop a more affordable vehicle. The ACV is intended to replace the AAV, which has been in use since 1971. The MPC was developed to serve as a survivable platform for inland transport, with swim capability for water obstacles. However, due to perceived redundancy, the MPC program was put on hold in 2013. The Marine Corps then decided to resurrect the MPC as ACV Increment 1.1, which would have a swim capability but rely on connectors to get to shore. The program faced budgetary pressures and had to focus on the ACV. The report details the requirements for the ACV and MPC, the development process, the cancellation of the EFV, the strategic vision for amphibious operations, the Expeditionary Advance Base Operations (EABO) concept, and the current status of the ACV program, including the selection of BAE Systems as the contractor. The report also discusses potential issues related to the consolidation of ACV variants, the impact on the ACV 2.0 program, and the implications of adopting EABO as an operational concept.\n\nNow, I need to condense this into a one-page summary. Let me outline the main sections:\n\n1. **Legal Requirements**: The Marine Corps is legally required to have amphibious and land operations capabilities, leading to the development of the ACV and MPC.\n\n2. **Program History**: The EFV program was canceled in 2011 due to cost overruns and poor performance.

Because the EFV was intended to replace the 40-year-old Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAV), the Pentagon pledged to move quickly to develop a \"more affordable and sustainable\" vehicle to replace the EFV. The Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) is intended to replace the AAV, incorporating some EFV capabilities but in a more practical and cost-efficient manner. In concert with the ACV, the Marines were developing the Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC) to serve as a survivable and mobile platform to transport Marines when ashore. The MPC was not intended to be amphibious like an AAV, EFV, or the ACV but instead would be required to have a swim capability for inland waterways such as rivers, lakes, and other water obstacles such as shore-to-shore operations in the littorals. Both vehicles were intended to play central roles in future Marine amphibious operations. On June 14, 2013, Marine leadership put the MPC program \"on ice\" due to budgetary pressures but suggested the program might be resurrected some 10 years down the road when budgetary resources might be more favorable. In what was described as a \"drastic shift,\" the Marines decided to \"resurrect\" the MPC in March 2014. The Marines designated the MPC as ACV Increment 1.1 and planned to acquire about 200 vehicles. The Marines also plan to develop ACV Increment 1.2, a tracked, fully amphibious version, and at the time planned to acquire about 470 vehicles and fund an ongoing high water speed study. Although ACV Increment 1.1 is to have a swim capability, another mode of transport (ship or aircraft) would be required to get the vehicles from ship to shore. The Marines are reportedly exploring the possibility of developing a high water speed ACV 2.0, which could accompany tanks and light armored vehicles into combat. On November 5, 2014, the Marines released a draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for ACV Increment 1.1. On November 24, 2015, the Marine Corps awarded BAE Systems and SAIC contracts to develop ACV 1.1 prototypes for evaluation. BAE's contract was for $103.8 million and SAIC's for $121.5 million, and each company was to build 16 prototypes to be tested over the next two years. Both BAE and SAIC delivered their prototypes early, and Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) testing began mid-March 2017. In early December 2017, the Marines reportedly sent the ACV 1.1 down select request for proposals to BAE and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). On June 19, 2018, the Marine Corps selected BAE Systems to produce the ACV. The initial contract—valued at $198 million—was for low-rate production of 30 vehicles to be delivered by the autumn of 2019. On April 10, 2019, during testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Navy and Marine Corps leadership announced that during the fall of 2018, ACV 1.1 prototypes demonstrated satisfactory water mobility performance in high surf conditions and, in doing so, met the full water mobility transition requirement for ACV 1.2 capability. As a result, ACV 1.1 and ACV 1.2 were to be consolidated into a single variant—the ACV—which is intended to replace all AAVs.

It then lists several significant issues, including Israel's capabilities for addressing threats, cooperation with the U.S., concerns about Iran, the U.S. exit from the 2015 nuclear agreement, tensions involving Iran and Hezbollah at Israel's northern border with Syria and Lebanon, Israeli-Palestinian issues like Jerusalem, Hamas, Gaza Strip, funding for Palestinians, and a possible Trump Administration peace plan.

Also, Israel's nuclear opacity and estimated arsenal. The U.S. has supported Israel's nuclear ambiguity since 1969, and there's a bilateral military aid MOU from 2016.\n\nThe report then discusses Iran as a primary concern for Israeli officials due to antipathy, regional influence, and potential nuclear developments. Israel and Arab Gulf states have cultivated closer relations to counter Iran. Netanyahu opposed the JCPOA and supported Trump's withdrawal from the agreement. He presented information about an Iranian archive to question Iran's credibility. However, some U.S. officials disputed the information. The U.S. and Israel have had some military actions in Syria, with Israel targeting Iranian and Hezbollah positions. The U.S. base at Al Tanf is a point of contention, as it helps counter Iran's efforts to create a land route for weapons to Lebanon. Russia's S-300 system in Syria could make it harder for Israel to operate there, but so far, Russia hasn't acted militarily to stop Israeli strikes. The U.S. has been involved in Syria, and the recognition of the Golan Heights as part of Israel by Trump has caused some international reactions. The U.S. policy change on the Golan is seen as a shift from the previous stance that it was Syrian territory.

Israeli domestic political issues, including elections scheduled for 2019. Israel relies on a number of strengths to manage potential threats to its security and existence. It maintains conventional military superiority relative to neighboring states and the Palestinians. It also takes measures to deter attack and defend its population and borders from evolving asymmetric threats such as rockets and missiles, cross-border tunneling, drones, and cyberattacks. Additionally, Israel has an undeclared but presumed nuclear weapons capability. Against a backdrop of strong bilateral cooperation, Israel's leaders and supporters routinely make the case that Israel's security and the broader stability of the region remain critically important for U.S. interests. A 10-year bilateral military aid memorandum of understanding (MOU)—signed in 2016—commits the United States to provide Israel $3.3 billion in Foreign Military Financing annually from FY2019 to FY2028, along with additional amounts from Defense Department accounts for missile defense. All of these amounts remain subject to congressional appropriations. Israeli officials seek to counter Iranian regional influence and prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu released new Israeli intelligence on Iran's nuclear program in April 2018, days before President Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 international agreement that constrains Iran's nuclear activities. It is unclear whether Israel might take future military action in Iran if Iranian nuclear activities resume. Since 2018, Israel has conducted a number of military operations in Syria against Iran and its allies, including Lebanese Hezbollah. Israel and Iran also appear to be competing for military advantage over each other at the Israel-Lebanon border. Amid uncertainty in the area, in March 2019 President Trump recognized Israel's claim to sovereignty over the Golan Heights, changing long-standing U.S. policy that held—in line with U.N. Security Council Resolution 497 from 1981—the Golan was occupied Syrian territory whose final status was subject to Israel-Syria negotiation. The prospects for an Israeli-Palestinian peace process are complicated by many factors. Palestinian leaders cut off high-level political contacts with the Trump Administration after it recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December 2017. U.S.-Palestinian tensions have since worsened amid U.S. cutoffs of funding to the Palestinians and diplomatic moves—including the May 2018 opening of the U.S. embassy to Israel in Jerusalem. Palestinian leaders interpreted these actions as prejudicing their claims to a capital in Jerusalem and to a just resolution of Palestinian refugee claims. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has welcomed these U.S. actions. The Trump Administration has suggested that it will release a proposed peace plan after Israeli elections, which are scheduled for April 9, 2019. Speculation continues about how warming ties between Israel and Arab Gulf states may affect Israeli-Palestinian diplomacy, though Saudi Arabia said that the U.S. policy change on the Golan Heights would negatively affect the peace process. Bouts of tension and violence between Israel and Hamas in Gaza have continued—reportedly accompanied by indirect talks between the two parties that are being brokered by Egypt and aim for a long-term cease-fire. Domestically, Israel is preparing for the April 9 elections, which are closely contested. Former top general Benny Gantz is combining with former Finance Minister Yair Lapid to challenge Netanyahu, whom the attorney general has recommended be indicted for corruption in three separate cases.

{"pred": " The Department of Defense (DOD) has implemented revised foreign currency budget rates since fiscal year 2009 to better align with market rates and manage potential gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations. These rates are used to determine DOD's funding needs for overseas expenditures, which are then compared to actual disbursement rates to calculate gains or losses. The methodology for establishing these rates has evolved, with the 2017 rates being calculated as a 6-month average of Wall Street Journal rates from May 25, 2015, to November 16, 2015. This approach was more aligned with the actual exchange rates experienced by the department during budget formulation, which accounted for the strength of the U.S. Dollar compared to its historical 5-year average. DOD's analysis found that using the 5-year historical average would have resulted in substantial gains, about $1 billion, compared with gains expected from the 6-month average. DOD has used various methodologies for establishing the foreign currency budget rates, including a centered weighted average model that combined both a 5-year average of exchange rates and an average of the most recently observed 12 months of exchange rates for fiscal years 2006 through 2016. In 2017, DOD adjusted its methodology to establish the foreign currency budget rates, which resulted in budget rates more closely aligned with market rates than in previous years, making revision of the 2017 budget rates unnecessary. DOD's use of revised foreign currency budget rates since 2014 has resulted in rates more closely aligned with those published by Treasury, thereby decreasing the expected gains that would have otherwise resulted from a substantial increase in the strength of the U.S. Dollar relative to other foreign currencies from the time the budget rates were set as compared with the rates available once the fiscal year began. The revised budget rates also decreased potential gains and losses in the amount of funds DOD had available for its planned overseas expenditures. DOD has used various methods for selecting foreign currency rates to liquidate those obligations through disbursements, which may differ from the budget rates. DOD's preferred payment method for foreign currency transactions is the Department of Treasury's (Treasury) comprehensive international payment and collection system—the International Treasury Services (ITS.gov) system—which serves federal agencies making payments in nearly 200 countries. ITS.gov offers a number of rates, including advanced rates available up to 5 days in advance of disbursement,", "answers": ["DOD requested about $60 billion for fiscal years 2009 - 2017 to purchase goods and services overseas and reimburse service-members for costs incurred while stationed abroad. DOD uses foreign currency exchange rates to budget and pay (that is, disburse amounts) for these expenses. It also manages the FCFD account to mitigate a loss in buying power that results from foreign currency rate changes. GAO was asked to examine DOD's processes to budget for and manage foreign currency fluctuations. This report (1) describes DOD's revision of its foreign currency budget rates since 2009 and the relationship between the revised rates and projected O&M and MILPERS funding needs; (2) evaluates the extent to which DOD has taken steps to reduce costs in selecting foreign currency rates to disburse funds to liquidate O&M obligations, and determined whether opportunities exist to gain additional savings; and (3) assesses the extent to which DOD has effectively managed the FCFD account balance. GAO analyzed data on foreign currency rates, DOD financial management regulations, a non-generalizable sample of foreign currency disbursement data, and FCFD account balances. The Department of Defense (DOD) revised its foreign currency exchange rates (“budget rates”) during fiscal years 2014 through 2016 for each of the nine foreign currencies it uses to develop its Operation and Maintenance (O&M) and Military Personnel (MILPERS) budget request. These revisions decreased DOD's projected O&M and MILPERS funding needs. DOD's revision of the budget rates during these years also decreased the expected gains (that is, buying power) that would have resulted from an increase in the strength of the U.S. Dollar relative to other foreign currencies. DOD did not revise its budget rates in fiscal years 2009 through 2013. For fiscal year 2017, DOD changed its methodology for producing budget rates, resulting in rates that were more closely aligned with market rates. According to officials, that change made it unnecessary to revise the budget rates during the fiscal year. DOD has taken some steps to reduce costs in selecting foreign currency rates used to pay (that is, disburse amounts) for goods and services, but DOD has not fully determined whether opportunities exist to achieve additional savings. The Army has estimated potential savings of up to $10 million annually by using a foreign currency rate available 3 days in advance of paying for goods or services rather than a more costly rate available up to 5 days in advance. The Army has converted to the use of a 3-day advanced rate. GAO's analysis suggests that DOD could achieve cost savings if the services reviewed and consistently selected the most cost-effective foreign currency rates when paying for their goods and services. Absent a review, DOD is at risk for paying more than it would otherwise be required to conduct its transactions. DOD used the Foreign Currency Fluctuations, Defense (FCFD) account to cover losses (that is, less buying power) due to unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations in 6 of the 8 years GAO reviewed. Since 2012, DOD has maintained the FCFD account balance at the statutory limit of $970 million, largely by transferring unobligated balances before they are cancelled from certain DOD accounts into the FCFD. However, DOD has not identified the appropriate FCFD account balance needed to maintain program operations by routinely analyzing projected losses and basing any transfers into the account on those expected losses. Thus, DOD may be maintaining balances that are hundreds of millions of dollars higher than needed, and that could have been used for other purposes or returned to the Treasury Department (see figure). GAO is making four recommendations, including that DOD review opportunities to achieve cost savings by more consistently selecting the most cost-effective foreign currency rates used for the payment of goods and services, and analyze projected losses to manage the FCFD account balance. DOD generally concurred with the recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10667}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report about the CFATS program. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points.\n\nThe report discusses DHS's management of the CFATS program, focusing on five areas: identifying high-risk facilities, risk assessment and prioritization, reviewing and approving security plans, conducting compliance inspections, and stakeholder outreach. The summary should highlight the progress made and the challenges identified in each area, along with the recommendations and DHS's responses.\n\nFirst, the report mentions that in May 2014, over 1,300 facilities reported having ammonium nitrate, but there were more facilities with this chemical than those reported. This led to the conclusion that some facilities failed to report. The recommendation was for DHS to work with agencies like EPA to improve data sharing. DHS agreed and implemented this by comparing data with other agencies and states, leading to the identification of additional facilities. As of June 2018, they had received 43 lists from 34 states, which are in various stages of review. They also hired a lead staff member for this effort.\n\nThen, there's the issue with the Distance of Concern, which was self-reported by facilities. The report found that over 2,700 facilities had misreported this, leading to recommendations for DHS to develop a new Top-Screen and verify the data. DHS implemented an updated Top-Screen in October 2016, which calculates the Distance of Concern itself instead of relying on facility calculations. They also identified 158 facilities with the potential to cause the greatest harm and had 156 submit updated Top-Screens, with 145 undergoing a quality assurance review by May 2017.\n\nRegarding risk assessment and tiering, the report found that DHS's approach didn't consider all elements of threat, vulnerability, and consequence as required by NIPP and CFATS. They also found that DHS was not using threat data for 90% of tiered facilities and using 5-year-old data for the remaining 10%. The recommendation was to enhance the risk assessment approach and conduct a peer review. DHS worked with Sandia National Laboratories to develop a model for economic consequences and Oak Ridge National Laboratory to create a new tiering methodology called the Second Generation Risk Engine. They revised the threat, vulnerability, and consequence scoring methods to better cover the range of CFATS security issues. They also conducted peer reviews and technical reviews", "answers": ["Thousands of facilities have hazardous chemicals that could be targeted or used to inflict mass casualties or harm surrounding populations in the United States. In accordance with the DHS Appropriations Act, 2007, DHS established the CFATS program in 2007 to, among other things, identify and assess the security risk posed by chemical facilities. DHS inspects high-risk facilities after it approves facility security plans to ensure that the facilities are implementing required security measures and procedures. This statement summarizes progress and challenges related to DHS's CFATS program management. This statement is based on prior products GAO issued from July 2012 through June 2017, along with updates conducted in June 2018 on DHS actions to address prior GAO recommendations. To conduct the prior work, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and DHS policies for administering the CFATS program, how DHS assesses risk, and data on high-risk chemical facilities. GAO also interviewed DHS officials and reviewed information on DHS actions to implement its prior recommendations. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has made progress addressing challenges that GAO's past work identified to managing the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program. The following summarizes progress made and challenges remaining in key aspects of the program. Identifying high-risk chemical facilities. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS used self-reported and unverified data to determine the risk of facilities holding toxic chemicals that could threaten surrounding communities if released. GAO recommended that DHS should better verify the accuracy of facility-reported data. DHS implemented this recommendation by revising its methodology so it now calculates the risk of toxic release, rather than relying on facilities to do so. Assessing risk and prioritizing facilities. In April 2013, GAO reported weaknesses in multiple aspects of DHS's risk assessment and prioritization approach. GAO made two recommendations for DHS to review and improve this process, including that DHS enhance its risk assessment approach to incorporate all of the elements of consequence, threat, and vulnerability associated with a terrorist attack involving certain chemicals. DHS launched a new risk assessment methodology in October 2016 and is currently gathering new or updated data from about 27,000 facilities to (1) determine which facilities should be categorized as high-risk because of the threat of sabotage, theft or diversion, or a toxic release and (2) assign those facilities deemed high risk to one of four risk-based tiers. GAO has ongoing work assessing these efforts and will report later this summer on the extent to which they fully address prior recommendations. Reviewing and approving facilities' site security plans . DHS is to review security plans and visit facilities to ensure their security measures meet DHS standards. In April 2013, GAO reported a 7 to 9 year backlog for these reviews and visits. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS had made substantial progress in addressing the backlog—estimating that it could take between 9 and 12 months for DHS to review and approve security plans for the approximately 900 remaining facilities. DHS has since taken additional action to expedite these activities and has eliminated this backlog. Inspecting facilities and ensuring compliance. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS conducted compliance inspections at 83 of the 1,727 facilities with approved security plans. GAO found that nearly half of the inspected facilities were not fully compliant with their approved security plans and that DHS did not have documented procedures for managing facilities' compliance. GAO recommended that DHS document procedures for managing compliance. As a result, DHS has developed an enforcement procedure and a draft compliance inspection procedure and expects to finalize the compliance inspection procedure by the end of fiscal year 2018. GAO has made various recommendations to strengthen DHS's management of the CFATS program, with which DHS has generally agreed. DHS has implemented or described planned actions to address most of these recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2363}
{"pred": " The report provides an overview of coal production, mining methods, and the regulatory framework governing coal mining in the United States, with a focus on the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) and its implementation by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE). In 2016, coal accounted for 17 percent of energy production and 30 percent of electricity production in the U.S., with approximately 730 million tons of coal mined domestically. About 40 percent of this coal was produced on federal lands. The report outlines the two primary methods of coal mining: surface mining and underground mining. Surface mining involves clearing vegetation and removing topsoil, followed by the use of explosives or other techniques to break up overlying rock, creating spoil. Underground mining involves digging tunnels to access coal that is too deep for surface mining methods. The report highlights the environmental impacts of coal mining, including water pollution, acid mine drainage, and changes in water tables. These effects are regulated under SMCRA, which also created OSMRE to administer the act. SMCRA allows states and Indian tribes to develop their own programs to implement the act if the Secretary of the Interior finds that the program is in accordance with federal law. Of the 25 states and four Indian tribes that OSMRE identified as having active coal mining in 2017, 23 states had primacy, and OSMRE manages the coal program in 2 states and for the four Indian tribes. The report details the permit process, which requires operators to submit plans describing the extent of proposed mining operations and how and on what timeline the mine sites will be reclaimed. Operators must reclaim the land to a use it was capable of supporting before mining or to an alternative postmining land use that is higher or better than the premining land use. The report also discusses the financial assurance requirements, including the types of financial assurances (surety bonds, collateral bonds, and self-bonds) and the amounts required. It highlights the challenges in managing these assurances, including the risk associated with self-bonding, unanticipated reclamation costs, and the financial stability of surety companies. The report also mentions the abandoned mine land program, which has spent billions to reclaim abandoned coal mines, with billions more remaining. The report concludes that Congress should consider amending SMCRA to eliminate the use of self-bonding as a type of financial assurance for coal mine reclamation.\n\nOkay, I need to", "answers": ["Coal accounts for 17 percent of domestic energy production. SMCRA requires coal mine operators to reclaim lands that were disturbed during mining and to submit a financial assurance in an amount sufficient to ensure that adequate funds will be available to complete reclamation if the operator does not do so. Recent coal company bankruptcies have drawn attention to whether financial assurances obtained by OSMRE and state agencies will be adequate to reclaim land once coal mining operations have ceased. GAO was asked to review management of financial assurances for coal mine reclamation. This report describes, among other things, the amounts and types of financial assurances held for coal mine reclamation in 2017 and the challenges that OSMRE and state agencies face in managing these financial assurances. GAO collected and analyzed data from OSMRE and 23 state agencies; reviewed federal laws, regulations, and directives; and interviewed OSMRE and state agency officials and representatives from organizations associated with the mining and financial assurance industries and environmental organizations. State agencies and the Department of the Interior's Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) reported holding approximately $10.2 billion in surety bonds (guaranteed by a third party), collateral bonds (guaranteed by a tangible asset, such as a certificate of deposit), and self-bonds (guaranteed on the basis of a coal operator's own finances) as financial assurances for coal mine reclamation. OSMRE and state agencies face several challenges in managing financial assurances, according to the stakeholders GAO interviewed. Specifically, Obtaining additional financial assurances from operators for unanticipated reclamation costs, such as long-term treatment for water pollution, can be difficult. Determining the financial stability of surety companies has been challenging in certain instances. Self-bonding presents a risk to the government because it is difficult to (1) ascertain the financial health of an operator, (2) determine whether the operator qualifies for self-bonding, and (3) obtain a replacement for existing self-bonds when an operator no longer qualifies. In addition, some stakeholders said that the risk from self-bonding is greater now than when the practice was first authorized under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA). GAO's previous work examining environmental cleanup found that the financial risk to government and the amount of oversight needed for self-bonds are relatively high compared to other forms of financial assurances. GAO also previously reviewed federal financial assurance requirements for various energy and mineral extraction sectors and found that coal mining is the only one where self-bonding was allowed. However, because SMCRA explicitly allows states to decide whether to accept self-bonds, eliminating the risk that self-bonds pose to the federal government and states would require SMCRA be amended. GAO recommends that Congress consider amending SMCRA to eliminate self-bonding. Interior neither agreed nor disagreed with GAO's recommendation."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6217}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about federal funding gaps and continuing resolutions. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report explains that federal agencies are funded annually through regular appropriations acts. However, when these acts are delayed, a continuing resolution (CR) is used to provide interim funding. The fiscal year started on October 1 in 1977, and there were only four instances where the regular appropriations acts were enacted by the start of the fiscal year. However, in one of those years, a CR wasn't needed for interim funding. The report mentions that in FY1977, a CR was enacted to fund certain unauthorized programs excluded from the regular appropriations acts. \n\nThe Antideficiency Act is mentioned as a law that prohibits the obligation or expenditure of federal funds in the absence of appropriations. A funding gap is defined as the period when appropriations for a particular project or activity are not enacted into law, either through a regular appropriations act or a CR. These gaps can occur at the start of the fiscal year or any time a CR expires and another is not enacted immediately. Multiple funding gaps can happen within a fiscal year. \n\nIn 1980 and 1981, the Attorney General issued opinions (Civiletti letters) that clarified the limits of federal activities during a funding gap. These letters stated that agencies can't make contracts or obligate funds unless \"authorized by law.\" Since no statute generally permits agencies to employ employees without appropriations, the Antideficiency Act doesn't authorize them to do so, but allows for certain legal obligations related to orderly termination. The second letter discussed obligations \"authorized by law\" but not in appropriations acts. Some Congresses have explicitly authorized agencies to incur obligations without regard to available appropriations. More often, it's necessary to inquire under what circumstances statutes that vest particular functions in government agencies imply authority to create obligations for the accomplishment of those functions despite a lack of current appropriations. Exceptions are made for activities involving \"the safety of human life or the protection of property.\" \n\nAs a result, when a funding gap occurs, agencies begin shutting down affected projects and activities, including furloughing non-excepted personnel. After the shutdown, agencies retroactively pay furloughed employees for the time they missed, as well as employees who were required to come to work. \n\nThe report also discusses the concept of a funding gap, which can occur at the start", "answers": ["The Antideficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341-1342, 1511-1519) generally bars the obligation of funds in the absence of appropriations. Exceptions are made under the act, including for activities involving \"the safety of human life or the protection of property.\" The interval during the fiscal year when appropriations for a particular project or activity are not enacted into law, either in the form of a regular appropriations act or a continuing resolution (CR), is referred to as a funding gap or funding lapse. Although funding gaps may occur at the start of the fiscal year, they may also occur any time a CR expires and another CR (or the regular appropriations bill) is not enacted immediately thereafter. Multiple funding gaps may occur within a fiscal year. When a funding gap occurs, federal agencies are generally required to begin a shutdown of the affected projects and activities, which includes the prompt furlough of non-excepted personnel. The general practice of the federal government after the shutdown has ended has been to retroactively pay furloughed employees for the time they missed, as well as employees who were required to come to work. Although a shutdown may be the result of a funding gap, the two events should be distinguished. This is because a funding gap may result in a total shutdown of all affected projects or activities in some instances but not others. For example, when funding gaps are of a short duration, agencies may not have enough time to complete a shutdown of affected projects and activities before funding is restored. In addition, the Office of Management and Budget has previously indicated that a shutdown of agency operations within the first day of the funding gap may be postponed if a resolution appears to be imminent. Since FY1977, 20 funding gaps occurred, ranging in duration from 1 day to 34 full days. These funding gaps are listed in Table 1. About half of these funding gaps were brief (i.e., three days or less in duration). Notably, many of the funding gaps do not appear to have resulted in a \"shutdown.\" Prior to the issuance of the opinions in 1980 and early 1981 by then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti, while agencies tended to curtail some operations in response to a funding gap, they often \"continued to operate during periods of expired funding.\" In addition, some of the funding gaps after the Civiletti opinions did not result in a completion of shutdown operations due to both the funding gap's short duration and an expectation that appropriations would soon be enacted. Some of the funding gaps during this period, however, did have a broader impact on affected government operations, even if only for a matter of hours. Two funding gaps occurred in FY1996, amounting to 5 days and 21 days. The chronology of regular and continuing appropriations enacted during FY1996 is illustrated in Figure 1. At the beginning of FY2014 (October 1, 2013), none of the regular appropriations bills had been enacted, so a government-wide funding gap occurred. It concluded on October 17, 2013, after lasting 16 full days. During FY2018, there was a funding gap when a CR covering all of the regular appropriations bills expired on January 19, 2018. It concluded on January 22, 2018, after lasting two full days. The most recent funding gap occurred during FY2019, when a CR covering federal agencies and activities funded in 7 of the 12 regular appropriations bills expired on December 21, 2018. It concluded on January 25, 2019, after lasting 34 full days.

These initiatives include the consolidation of physical infrastructure, such as the closure of 74 of DLA Document Services' 112 facilities in the continental United States, and the reduction of the number of print devices. The report highlights that DLA Document Services is the single manager for printing and high-speed, high-volume duplication, and that the DOD is in the process of revising its instruction on document services. The report also discusses the status of efficiency initiatives related to DOD’s document services, including the transformation plan for DLA Document Services, which aims to transition DOD from on-site printing to digital, online services. The plan includes closing or consolidating 74 of DLA’s facilities in the continental United States, reducing the number of full-time equivalent positions from about 600 to about 400, and increasing the use of electronic content management systems. The report identifies four areas where further gains may be possible: better managing fragmentation in printing and reproduction services, reducing overlap in procuring print devices, meeting goals to reduce the number of print devices, and consolidating locations that provide mission specialty printing. The report also found that DOD components, including the military services, use multiple approaches to obtain printing and reproduction services, which can lead to inefficiencies. For example, the Army Publishing Directorate has been given authority to obtain services directly from GPO, while the Army Marketing and Research Group (AMRG) obtains services directly from GPO without involving DLA. Some DOD components, such as the Navy, Marine Corps, and National Guard Bureau, also operate their own in-house print facilities. The report concludes that while DOD has made progress in achieving efficiencies in its document services, there are still opportunities for further gains, particularly in managing fragmentation and reducing overlap in procurement processes. The report also highlights the importance of accurate financial information in decision-making processes, as well as the potential for additional cost savings through strategic sourcing and consolidation efforts. The report makes six recommendations to DOD, including the need to assess the effectiveness of DLA Document Services as a single manager for printing and reproduction services, evaluate the current approach to obtaining print devices, and improve the accuracy of financial information reporting on document services to Congress and other stakeholders.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report. Let me start by understanding the key points. The report is about the Department of Defense's document services, their structure, and", "answers": ["DOD has reported printing costs that totaled about $608 million, on average, during fiscal years 2010 through 2015. DLA Document Services has key DOD-wide responsibilities for (1) printing and reproduction, (2) print device procurement, and (3) electronic content management (e.g., digital document repositories). Other DOD components, including the military services, also maintain some document services capabilities at various locations. House Report 115-200 accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018 included a provision for GAO to examine DOD's document services. This report evaluates (1) the progress DOD has made in achieving efficiencies in its document services and opportunities, if any, to achieve further efficiencies, and (2) the extent to which DOD reports accurate financial information about its document services to key stakeholders. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials regarding DOD's efficiency initiatives, including DLA Document Services' transformation plan; reviewed print device procurement contracts and pricing information; and analyzed DOD budget data for fiscal years 2012 through 2016. The Department of Defense (DOD) has taken steps to achieve efficiencies in its document services, including implementing a transformation plan to consolidate existing Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Document Services facilities. However, GAO identified four areas where further gains may be possible: Managing fragmentation in printing and reproduction services. DOD has designated DLA Document Services as the single manager for printing and reproduction services, but DOD customers, citing concerns with DLA's services, have also obtained these services directly from the Government Publishing Office and via in-house print facilities (see fig.). DOD has not assessed DLA's performance in this role or whether additional efficiencies may be possible in light of DLA's transformation plan. Reducing overlap in procuring print devices. GAO found that DOD components used at least four different contract sources to acquire print devices. DOD has not assessed which acquisition approach represents the best value; doing so might better position DOD to further reduce its costs. Meeting goals to reduce the number of print devices. DOD and the military services have not demonstrated that they achieved established goals for reducing the number of print devices. Additional controls and assignment of oversight responsibilities to monitor progress could better enable DOD to achieve its cost savings goals, estimated to be millions of dollars annually. Consolidating DLA facilities. DLA is closing or consolidating 74 of its 112 facilities in the United States. However, GAO found that for four of seven types of specialty services, DLA plans to retain facilities that are responsible for less than 5 percent of the total revenue for each of those specialties, which suggests that further consolidations are possible. DOD includes the cost of non-printing activities, such as the purchase of advertising time for recruiting, within its budget materials for printing and reproduction. It does not include costs to acquire print devices and for electronic content management. As a result, DOD and the Congress lack the oversight into total document services costs needed to make informed decisions.

{"pred": " The federal government owns and leases hundreds of thousands of buildings across the country, costing billions annually to operate and maintain. In recent years, the government has implemented initiatives to improve real property management, including the Reduce the Footprint (RTF) policy. This policy, introduced in 2015, aims to reduce the federal government's real property footprint by focusing on consolidation, co-location, and disposal of unneeded properties. The RTF policy requires agencies to submit annual Real Property Efficiency Plans (Plans) to GSA and OMB, set reduction targets for a 5-year period, and implement strategies to reduce space. The report analyzed the approaches and challenges faced by 24 CFO Act agencies in achieving their RTF targets and the extent to which they reduced their space. The agencies primarily used consolidation, co-location, and disposal of unneeded space to reduce their real property footprint. Other methods included utilizing telework and decreasing the space allocated per person to achieve space reductions. The report also highlighted the challenges agencies faced, such as space reduction costs, mission delivery requirements, employee organization concerns, and workload growth. The agencies reported varying degrees of success in meeting their space reduction targets, with some exceeding their targets and others missing them. The report also discussed how GSA manages vacated space, including the process of receiving, reviewing, and documenting space release actions, and the development of options for filling vacant space or effectively utilizing the unneeded space. The report concluded that the RTF policy is a long-term effort to improve the federal utilization of space and reduce the government's operational costs.

GSA provides space for agencies in government-owned and commercially leased buildings. In 2015, the OMB issued a memorandum requiring the 24 agencies with chief financial officers to reduce their domestic office and warehouse space. These agencies are required to set annual reduction targets for a 5-year time period and update their real property plans annually. GAO was asked to review the implementation of this space reduction initiative. This report discusses: (1) the approaches and any challenges the 24 agencies identified to achieving their reduction targets for all their domestic office and warehouse space; (2) the extent these agencies reduced their space and met their fiscal year 2016 targets; and (3) how GSA manages vacated space it had leased to these agencies. GAO conducted a content analysis of the 24 agencies' real property plans for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 and analyzed agencies' data as submitted to GSA on their targets and reductions for fiscal year 2016, the only year for which data were available. GAO selected five agencies as case studies based on several factors, including size of the agencies' office and warehouse portfolio, agency reduction targets, and fiscal year 2016 reported reductions. GAO reviewed relevant documentation and interviewed officials from GSA, OMB, and GAO's case study agencies. GAO provided a draft of this product to GSA, OMB, and our case study agencies for comment. GAO incorporated technical comments, as appropriate. Most of the 24 agencies with chief financial officers reported to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the General Services Administration (GSA) that they planned to consolidate their office and warehouse space and allocate fewer square feet per employee as the key ways to achieve their space reduction targets. For example, the Department of Agriculture reported it will consolidate staff from five component agencies in two office buildings. When complete, the space allocated per employee will average about 250 square feet down from a high of 420 square feet per employee. In taking these actions, the agencies most often identified the cost of space reduction projects as a challenge to achieving their targets. Agencies cited costs such as for space renovations to accommodate more staff and required environmental clean-up before disposing of property as challenges to completing projects. Some agencies required to maintain offices across the country reported that their mission requirements limit their ability to reduce their space. In fiscal year 2016, 17 of the 24 agencies reported they reduced their space, but had varying success achieving their first-year targets. Of the 17 agencies, 9 exceeded their target and reduced more space than planned, 7 missed their target (by anywhere between 2.8 and 96.7 percent), and 1 reduced space, despite a targeted increase. Agency officials said that it is not unusual for projects to shift to different years and that such shifts could lead to missing targets one year and exceeding them the next. GSA has processes to manage the space vacated by agencies that is leased through GSA. For example, starting in November 2016, GSA started tracking agencies' space release requests centrally to help standardize the process and established an e-mail address to which agencies can submit requests. GSA relies on regional offices to manage real property in their regions and to identify tenants for vacant space or to remove unused space from the inventory. GSA's regional officials said regular monitoring and coordinating with agencies minimizes the likelihood GSA is caught off guard by a return of space. These processes also help them to plan ahead. GSA met its 2016 performance goal to have an annual vacant space rate of no more than 3.2 percent in its federally owned and leased buildings.

The report is about the decline of cash as a payment method and the rise of electronic payments, including both traditional systems like credit cards and newer systems like cryptocurrencies. It also discusses the potential benefits and risks of a cashless society.\n\nFirst, the report mentions that technological advances have made electronic payments more available, convenient, and cost-efficient. Established technologies like credit and debit cards are popular. Newer digital currencies, such as cryptocurrencies, offer alternatives that are independent from traditional systems. However, these are not yet widely adopted. The report also notes that while cash remains an important method of payment in the U.S., some businesses are choosing not to accept cash, especially those with low-dollar-value transactions. In some developed countries, like Sweden, cash payments are becoming relatively scarce. Central banks worldwide are examining the possibility of issuing government-backed digital currencies that exist only electronically. These trends suggest that due to buyer or seller preference or government policy, the role of cash in the payment system may continue to decline, perhaps significantly, in coming years.\n\nThe report also discusses the consequences of an evolution away from cash. Proponents of reducing the use of physical currency argue that it will generate important benefits, including potentially improved efficiency of the payment system, a reduction of crime, and less constrained monetary policy. On the other hand, proponents of maintaining cash as a payment option argue that significant reductions in cash usage and acceptance would further marginalize people with limited access to the financial system, increase the financial system's vulnerability to cyberattack, and reduce personal privacy.\n\nThe report is divided into two parts. Part I analyzes cash and noncash payment systems, including traditional electronic payment systems (such as credit cards or payment apps) and alternative electronic payment systems, focusing on private systems using distributed ledger technology (such as cryptocurrencies) and central bank digital currencies (which are only under consideration by central banks at this time). Part I also examines the advantages and costs specific to each payment system and the potential obstacles to the adoption of alternative electronic payment systems. Part II of this report analyzes the potential implications of a reduced role of cash payments in the economy, including potential benefits, costs, and risks. The report also includes an Appendix that presents two international case studies of economies in which noncash payment systems rapidly expanded. This section provides analysis of cash, traditional noncash payment systems, and potential alternative payment systems. It describes the characteristics, presents usage", "answers": ["Electronic forms of payment have become increasingly available, convenient, and cost efficient due to technological advances in digitization and data processing. Anecdotal reporting and certain analyses suggest that businesses and consumers are increasingly eschewing cash payments in favor of electronic payment methods. Such trends have led analysts and policymakers to examine the possibility that the use and acceptance of cash will significantly decline in coming years and to consider the effects of such an evolution. Cash is still a common and widely accepted payment system in the United States. Cash's advantages include its simplicity and robustness as a payment system that requires no ancillary technologies. In addition, it provides privacy in transactions and protection from cyber threats or financial institution failures. However, using cash involves costs to businesses and consumers who pay fees to obtain, manage, and protect cash and exposes its users to loss through misplacement, theft, or accidental destruction of physical currency. Cash also concurrently generates government revenues through \"profits\" earned by producing it and by acting as interest-free liabilities to the Federal Reserve (in contrast to reserve balances on which the Federal Reserve pays interest), while reducing government revenues by facilitating some tax avoidance. The relative advantages and costs of various payment methods will largely determine whether and to what degree electronic payment systems will displace cash. Traditional noncash payment systems (such as credit and debit cards and interbank clearing systems) involving intermediaries such as banks and central banks address some of the shortcomings of cash payments. These systems can execute payments over physical distance, allow businesses and consumers to avoid some of the costs and risks of using cash, and are run by generally trusted and closely regulated intermediaries. However, the maintenance and operation of legacy noncash systems involve their own costs, and the intermediaries charge fees to recoup those costs and earn profits. The time it takes to finalize certain transactions—including crediting customer accounts for check or electronic deposits—can lead to consumers incurring additional costs. In addition, these systems involve cybersecurity risks and generally require customers to divulge their private personal information to gain system access, which raises privacy concerns. To date, the migration away from cash has largely been in favor of traditional noncash payment systems; however, some observers predict new alternative systems will play a larger role in the future. Such alternative systems aim to address some of the inefficiencies and risks of traditional noncash systems, but face obstacles to achieving that aim and involve costs of their own. Private systems using distributed ledger technology, such as cryptocurrencies, may not serve the main functions of money well and face challenges to widespread acceptance and technological scalability. These systems also raise concerns among certain observers related to whether these systems could facilitate crime, provide inadequate protections to consumers, and may adversely affect governments' ability to implement or transmit monetary policy. The potential for increased payment efficiency from these systems is promising enough that certain central banks have investigated the possibility of issuing government-backed, electronic-only currencies—called central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)—in such a way that the benefits of certain alternative payment systems could be realized with appropriately mitigated risk. How CBDCs would be created and function are still matters of speculation at this time, and the possibility of their introduction raises questions about the appropriate role of a central bank in the financial system and the economy. If the relative benefits and costs of cash and the various other payment methods evolve in such a way that cash is significantly displaced as a commonly accepted form of payment, that evolution could have a number of effects, both positive and negative, on the economy and society. Proponents of reducing cash usage (or even eliminating it all together and becoming a cashless society) argue that doing so will generate important benefits, including potentially improved efficiency of the payment system, a reduction of crime, and less constrained monetary policy. Proponents of maintaining cash as a payment option argue that significant reductions in cash usage and acceptance would further marginalize people with limited access to the financial system, increase the financial system's vulnerability to cyberattack, and reduce personal privacy. Based on their assessment of the magnitude of these benefits and costs and the likelihood that market forces will displace cash as a payment system, policymakers may choose to encourage or discourage this trend."], "all_classes": null, "length": 9601}
{"pred": " (One page)\nThe federal government, through the Department of Energy, operates four regional Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs): the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), the Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA), the Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA), and the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA). These agencies were established to manage and sell electricity generated by federal dams, which were primarily built for irrigation, flood control, or other purposes, and to provide service to customers who would not be profitable for private utilities to serve. The PMAs are responsible for marketing the electric power produced by federal dams, with the exception of minor ones, and must give preference to public utility districts and cooperatives, selling their power at cost-based rates set at the lowest possible rate consistent with sound business principles. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates PMA rates to ensure that they are set high enough to repay the U.S. Treasury on schedule for the portion of federal facility costs that have been allocated to hydropower beneficiaries. Since FY2011, power revenues associated with the PMAs have been classified as discretionary offsetting receipts (i.e., receipts that are available for spending by the PMAs), thus the agencies are sometimes noted as having a \"net-zero\" spending authority. Only the capital expenses of WAPA and SWPA require appropriations from Congress. Each PMA also has unique elements and regional issues that affect its business. They are discussed in alphabetical order. Created by the Bonneville Project Act of 1937 (16 U.S.C. §832) just before the completion of two large dams in the Pacific Northwest—Bonneville Dam in 1938 and Grand Coulee Dam in 1941—BPA was the first PMA. Though it serves a smaller geographical area, BPA is on par with WAPA (which serves the largest area) in the size of its transmission system. The agency operates and maintains about 75% of the high voltage transmission lines in its service territory, which includes Idaho, Oregon, Washington, western Montana and small parts of eastern Montana, California, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming. BPA also markets wholesale electricity from 31 federally owned hydropower facilities in the Northwest. These generation facilities are owned both by the Corps and BOR. BPA differs from the other three PMAs in that it is self-financed: it receives no federal appropriations.

Each PMA operates in a distinct geographic area. Congressional interest in the PMAs has included diverse issues such as rate setting, cost and compliance associated with the Endangered Species Act (ESA; P.L. 93-205; 16 U.S.C. §§1531 et seq.), and questions of privatization of these federal agencies. In general, the PMAs came into being because of the government's need to dispose of electric power produced by dams constructed largely for irrigation, flood control, or other purposes, and to achieve small community and farm electrification—that is, providing service to customers whom it would not have been profitable for a private utility to serve. With minor exceptions, these agencies market the electric power produced by federal dams constructed, owned, and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) and the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR). By statute, PMAs must give preference to public utility districts and cooperatives (e.g., \"preference customers\"), and sell their power at cost-based rates set at the lowest possible rate consistent with sound business principles. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates PMA rates to ensure that they are set high enough to repay the U.S. Treasury for the portion of federal facility costs allocated to hydropower beneficiaries. With energy and capacity markets changing in the western United States (especially with the growing need to integrate increasing amounts of variable renewable sources), and the development of the Energy Imbalance Market in the West, BPA and WAPA may have to adapt their plans with regard to generation needs and how transmission systems are developed. In 2018, the Trump Administration proposed to sell the transmission assets (lines, towers, substations, and/or rights of way) owned and operated by the federal Power Marketing Administrations. The proposal suggested that \"eliminating or reducing\" the federal government's role in owning and operating transmission assets, and increasing the private sector's role, would \"encourage a more efficient allocation of economic resources and mitigate unnecessary risk to taxpayers.\" The resulting PMA entities would then contract with other utilities to provide transmission services for the delivery of federal power, similar to what SEPA does currently. Reportedly, the proposed sale of PMA assets was dropped after opposition to the plan emerged from stakeholders. Under Section 208 of the Urgent Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1986 (P.L. 99-349), the executive branch is prohibited from spending funds to study or draft proposals to transfer from federal control any portion of the assets of the PMAs unless specifically authorized by Congress. Environmental, fishing, and tribal advocates have sued the federal government over concerns that operating rules for hydropower dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers (i.e., the National Marine Fisheries Service Biological Opinion) are inadequate to ensure survival of species threatened or endangered under the ESA. In 2016, a federal judge overturned a previous management plan for the dams, finding that it would not be sufficient to protect salmon runs, and ordered a new management plan that could include removing the dams. However, in 2018, President Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum accelerating the process for a new management plan, requiring the biological opinion to be ready by 2020.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about the minority leader in the House of Representatives. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points.\n\nThe report explains that the minority leader is the head of the \"loyal opposition\" in the House. Their role is to represent the minority party's interests, which are often overshadowed by the majority's control. The minority leader is typically an experienced member of the House, elected by their party caucus. The report also discusses the historical development of this position, starting in the late 19th century, and the various responsibilities of the minority leader, both formal and informal. These include being a spokesperson for the party, participating in the legislative process, managing party conflicts, and promoting the party's agenda. The minority leader's main goal is to recapture majority control of the House, which is a challenging task due to the inherent power imbalance. The report also covers different strategies that can be employed by the minority leader, such as cooperation, opposition, withdrawal, innovation, and participation. These strategies vary depending on the situation, the level of party cohesion, and the political climate. The minority leader must also navigate the institutional obligations of their position, which include roles in the House's standing rules and other responsibilities. The report concludes by highlighting the strategic dilemma faced by the minority leader: the limitation of inferior numbers, which can be overcome with the right approach but is not always possible.\n\nNow, I need to condense this into a one-page summary. Let me structure it with an introduction, key points about the role of the minority leader, their responsibilities, strategies, and the conclusion about the challenges.\n\nIntroduction: The report discusses the role of the minority leader in the House of Representatives, highlighting their position as the head of the \"loyal opposition\" and the challenges they face in an institution dominated by majority rule.\n\nKey Points:\n- The minority leader is elected by their party caucus, typically an experienced member of the House.\n- Their primary goal is to recapture majority control of the House.\n- The minority leader's role is to serve as the leader and spokesperson for the minority party, and to participate in certain institutional prerogatives afforded to Members in the minority.\n- The duties of the minority leader are based on tradition and custom, with some responsibilities added over time.\n- The minority leader must manage intraparty conflict, maintain party unity, and promote the party's agenda.\n- The minority leader's role is influenced by various factors,", "answers": ["The House minority leader, the head of the \"loyal opposition,\" is elected every two years by secret ballot of his or her party caucus or conference. The minority leader occupies a number of important institutional and party roles and responsibilities, and his or her fundamental goal is to recapture majority control of the House. From a party perspective, the minority leader has a wide range of assignments, all geared toward retaking majority control of the House. Five principal party activities direct the work of the minority leader. First, he or she provides campaign assistance to party incumbents and challengers. Second, the minority leader devises strategies, in consultation with like-minded colleagues, to advance party objectives. Third, the minority leader works to promote and publicize the party's agenda. Fourth, the minority leader, if his or her party controls the White House, confers regularly with the President and his aides about issues before Congress, the Administration's agenda, and political events generally. Fifth, the minority leader strives to promote party harmony so as to maximize the chances for legislative and political success. From an institutional perspective, the rules of the House assign a number of specific responsibilities to the minority leader. For example, Rule XIII, clause 6, grants the minority leader (or a designee) the right to offer a motion to recommit with instructions; and Rule II, clause 6, states that the Inspector General shall be appointed by joint recommendation of the Speaker, majority leader, and minority leader.

{"pred": " Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is a federal law that prohibits discrimination \"on the basis of sex\" in educational programs receiving federal funding. While the statute does not explicitly mention sexual abuse or harassment, federal courts have interpreted Title IX to provide a private right of action for victims of such conduct, with the Supreme Court establishing that a school district can be held liable for damages based on a deliberately indifferent response to a teacher's sexual abuse or harassment of a student. The Court has also held that a school board may be liable under Title IX for a deliberately indifferent response to student-on-student sexual harassment. Meanwhile, federal agencies that administratively enforce the statute, such as the Department of Education (ED), have also determined that educational institutions can be held responsible for instances of sexual harassment under Title IX in certain circumstances. Title IX is primarily enforced in two ways: (1) through private rights of action directly against schools by or on behalf of students subject to such harassment in certain circumstances; and (2) by federal agencies that provide funding to educational programs. With respect to the latter enforcement prong, like several other federal civil rights statutes, Title IX makes compliance with its antidiscrimination mandate a condition for receiving federal funding in any education program or activity. Title IX applies to federal-funded schools at all levels of education. For instance, all public school districts receive some federal financial assistance, as do most institutions of higher education through participation in federal student aid programs. Notably, when any part of a school district or institution of higher education receives federal funds, all of the recipient's operations are covered by Title IX. The text of Title IX does not expressly mention sexual abuse or harassment, while current regulations implementing the statute also do not explicitly address sexual harassment (although the regulations do require schools to designate at least one employee to function as a Title IX Coordinator). In each of the last several presidential administrations, however, the Department of Education (ED) has issued guidance documents that instruct schools regarding their responsibilities under Title IX when addressing allegations of sexual harassment. In response, educational institutions have developed procedures and practices to investigate and respond to allegations of sexual harassment and assault. And ED recently issued another notice of proposed rulemaking, after having revoked some of its prior guidance to schools in 2017. As discussed in this report, if adopted, the regulations would significantly change educational institutions' responsibilities for responding to sexual harassment allegations. To place the proposed Title IX regulations in context, this report provides background on the legal landscape that informs the proposal. First,", "answers": ["Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) provides an avenue of legal relief for victims of sexual abuse and harassment at educational institutions. It bars discrimination \"on the basis of sex\" in an educational program or activity receiving federal funding. Although Title IX makes no explicit reference to sexual harassment or abuse, the Supreme Court and federal agencies have determined that such conduct can sometimes constitute discrimination in violation of the statute; educational institutions in some circumstances can be held responsible when a teacher sexually harasses a student or when one student harasses another. Title IX is mainly enforced (1) through private rights of action brought directly against schools by or on behalf of students subjected to sexual misconduct; and (2) by federal agencies that provide funding to educational programs. To establish liability in a private right of action, a party seeking damages for a Title IX violation must satisfy the standards set forth by the Supreme Court in Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District, decided in 1998, and Davis Next Friend LaShonda D. v. Monroe County Board of Education, decided the next year. Gebser provides that when a teacher commits harassment against a student, a school district is liable only when it has actual knowledge of allegations by an \"appropriate person,\" and so deficiently responds to those allegations that its response amounts to deliberate indifference to the discrimination. Davis instructs that, besides showing actual knowledge by an appropriate person and deliberate indifference, a plaintiff suing for damages for sexual harassment committed by a student must show that the conduct was \"so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive\" that it denied the victim equal access to educational opportunities or benefits. Taken together, the Supreme Court's decisions set forth a high threshold for a private party seeking damages against an educational institution based on its response to sexual harassment. In turn, federal appellate courts have differed in how to apply the standards set in Gebser and Davis, diverging on the nature and amount of evidence sufficient to support a claim. In each of the last several presidential administrations, the Department of Education (ED) issued a number of guidance documents that instruct schools on their responsibilities under Title IX when addressing allegations of sexual harassment. These documents—while sometimes subject to change—generally reflected a different standard than the Supreme Court case law addressing private rights of action for damages for sexual abuse or harassment (the Court in Davis acknowledged that the threshold for liability in a private right of action could be higher than the standard imposed in the administrative enforcement context). Those guidance documents had, among other things, established that sometimes a school could be held responsible for instances of sexual harassment by a teacher, irrespective of actual notice; and schools could be held responsible for student-on-student harassment if a \"responsible employee\" knew or should have known of the harassment (constructive notice). ED's previous guidance also instructed educational institutions that they sometimes could be responsible for responding to incidents of sexual harassment occurring off campus. ED also cautioned schools on the use of mediation to resolve allegations of sexual harassment. With regard to the procedures used by schools to resolve sexual harassment allegations, ED informed schools that they must use the preponderance of the evidence standard to establish culpability, and the agency strongly discouraged schools from allowing parties in a hearing to personally cross-examine one another. In response to guidance from ED, as well as increased oversight from the department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) between 2011 and 2016, schools developed several procedures to ensure that their responses to allegations of sexual harassment and assault complied with Title IX. A number of students faced with disciplinary action by public universities raised constitutional challenges to the Title IX procedures used to find them responsible for sexual misconduct, arguing that universities violated the Due Process Clause in handling their case. ED issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in late 2018, after revoking some of its previous guidance to schools in 2017. The proposed regulations would, in several ways, tether the administrative requirements for schools to the standard set by the Supreme Court in Gebser and Davis. In doing so, the proposed regulations would depart from the standards set by ED in previous guidance documents (some of which have since been rescinded). The new regulations would require \"actual notice,\" rather than constructive notice, of harassment by an education institution to trigger a school's Title IX responsibilities, and provide that a school's response to allegations of sexual harassment will violate Title IX only if it amounts to deliberate indifference. In addition, the new regulations would more narrowly define what conduct qualifies as sexual harassment under Title IX, and also impose new procedural requirements, which appear to reflect due process concerns, when schools investigate sexual harassment or assault allegations and make determinations of culpability."], "all_classes": null, "length": 14692}
{"pred": " The National Science Foundation (NSF) utilizes two primary programs to bring rotators into the agency: the IPA (Interagency Personnel) program and the VSEE (Voluntary Service with Employment) program. These programs differ in key aspects, including employment status, compensation, and oversight mechanisms. \n\nUnder the IPA program, the NSF enters into written agreements with rotators’ home institutions for all assignments. These agreements detail the rotators’ salaries and benefits at their home institutions, as well as the cost-sharing amounts NSF and home institutions are to pay during the rotators’ assignments. NSF reimburses its cost-sharing amounts to home institutions, which continue to pay rotators’ full salaries and benefits. Unlike VSEE rotators, who are federal employees on a nonpaid leave from their home institutions, IPA rotators may receive salaries that exceed the maximum federal salary for the position they hold at NSF. However, if an IPA rotator’s salary is less than the minimum federal salary for the position, NSF will supplement the salary to the minimum rate. \n\nIn contrast, VSEE rotators are appointed as federal employees on a nonpaid leave from their home institutions. They receive their salaries directly from NSF but are not eligible for certain federal benefits, such as retirement. Instead, NSF reimburses the home institutions for the employer’s share of retirement, life insurance, and health benefits that would otherwise be discontinued. NSF’s policy is to set salaries for VSEE rotators that are generally comparable to the salaries the rotators would receive at their home institutions. In setting salaries, NSF also takes into account other sources of income, such as consulting, and allows for locality pay adjustments applicable to employees in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. However, because VSEE rotators are federal employees, NSF caps their salaries at the federal maximum for the position they hold at NSF. \n\nBoth IPA and VSEE rotators are eligible for certain other types of reimbursement, such as moving expenses to and from Washington, D.C., or per diem allowances for up to 2 years. Additionally, the NSF may reimburse rotators for travel-related expenses related to their participation in the Independent Research and Development program, which enables NSF staff to maintain their involvement with their professional research and research-related activities at their home institutions. \n\nThe report also discusses the use of rotators in NSF’s seven scientific directorates, which are further subdivided into divisions, offices, and sections. Each of these positions is an executive position at NSF.

Benefits include fresh perspectives and close connections to the scientific community, while challenges include staffing turnover and higher costs for some rotators compared with permanent employees. GAO was asked to review NSF's use and management of the IPA and VSEE rotator programs, among other things. This report examines (1) the number, costs, and uses of NSF rotators for fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2017; (2) the strategies NSF has used to manage rotator costs and the results of these efforts; and (3) the extent to which NSF has a workforce strategy for using rotators and has evaluated the results of its rotator programs. GAO analyzed summary-level data on NSF's rotators; reviewed key documents; interviewed NSF officials; conducted semistructured interviews with a nongeneralizable sample of rotators and permanent federal employees selected from different scientific directorates within NSF; and compared NSF's management of the program to key principles for effective strategic workforce planning. The numbers of rotators—outside scientists, engineers, and educators on temporary assignment—at the National Science Foundation (NSF) and their costs in proportion to other staff remained relatively stable in fiscal years 2008 through 2017. Most rotators joined NSF under its Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) mobility program. IPA rotators comprised about 12 percent of NSF's workforce and 17 percent of staff costs on average and were not subject to a federal salary cap. They remain employees of their home institutions, with NSF reimbursing the institutions for most of their salaries and benefits. The remaining rotators are considered temporary federal employees under the Visiting Scientist, Engineer, and Educator (VSEE) program; their salaries could not exceed the federal maximum for their positions. Beginning in fiscal year 2017, NSF adopted IPA rotator program cost management strategies expected to achieve the greatest savings with the least harm to recruitment, but NSF officials said it is too soon to determine the full results. For example, for new IPA rotators who had not yet begun negotiating their assignments, NSF began requiring their home institutions to pay for 10 percent of the rotators' salary and benefits. NSF officials told GAO they expect to issue a report evaluating the strategies in December 2018. NSF's IPA program steering committee recommended developing a workforce strategy for balancing the agency's use of rotators with federal staff, but as of June 2018, NSF had not developed a strategy or fully evaluated the IPA and VSEE rotator programs' results, as called for by GAO's key principles for effective strategic workforce planning. NSF officials said they recognized the value of a workforce strategy but were focusing instead on other workforce planning efforts, and they had not fully evaluated program results in part because rotators are blended into the agency's permanent workforce, making a separate evaluation difficult. Without a workforce strategy and evaluation of results, NSF is limited in its ability to manage and, if warranted, adjust its use of rotators. GAO recommends that NSF develop an agency-wide strategy for balancing the agency's use of rotators with permanent staff and evaluate the contributions of its rotator programs toward NSF's human capital goals and programmatic results.

This report provides a high-level overview of the most prominent housing-related issues that may be of interest during the 116th Congress. It is not intended to provide detailed information or analysis, but it includes references to more in-depth CRS reports on these issues where possible. The report begins with a discussion of current housing and mortgage market conditions to provide context for the housing policy issues discussed in the remainder of the report. This discussion of market conditions is at the national level. However, it is important to be aware that local housing market conditions can vary dramatically, and national housing market trends may not reflect the conditions in a specific area. Nevertheless, national housing market indicators can provide an overall sense of general trends in housing. In general, rising home prices, relatively low interest rates, and rising rental costs have been prominent features of housing and mortgage markets in recent years. Although interest rates have remained low, rising house prices and rental costs that in many cases have outpaced income growth have led to increased concerns about housing affordability for both prospective homebuyers and renters. Most homebuyers take out a mortgage to purchase a home. Therefore, owner-occupied housing markets and the mortgage market are closely linked, although they are not the same. The ability of prospective homebuyers to obtain mortgages, and the costs of those mortgages, impact housing demand and affordability. The following subsections show current trends in selected owner-occupied housing and mortgage market indicators. As shown in Figure 1, nationally, nominal house prices have been increasing on a year-over-year basis in each quarter since the beginning of 2012, with year-over-year increases exceeding 5% for much of that time period and exceeding 6% for most quarters since mid-2016. These increases follow almost five years of house price declines in the years during and surrounding the economic recession of 2007-2009 and associated housing market turmoil. House price increases slowed somewhat during 2018, but year-over-year house prices still increased by nearly 6% during the fourth quarter of 2018.

Congress might consider comprehensive housing finance reform legislation to resolve the status of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Furthermore, a new director for the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's regulator and conservator, was sworn in on April 15, 2019. Congress may take an interest in any administrative changes that FHFA might make to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under new leadership. Appropriations for federal housing programs, including programs at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and rural housing programs administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), particularly in light of discretionary budget caps that are currently scheduled to decrease for FY2020. Oversight of the implementation of certain changes to federal assisted housing programs that were enacted in prior Congresses, such as expansions of HUD's Moving to Work (MTW) program and Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program. Considerations related to housing and the federal response to major disasters, including oversight of the implementation of certain changes related to Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) assistance that were enacted in the previous Congress. Consideration of legislation related to certain federal housing programs that provide assistance to Native Americans living in tribal areas. Consideration of legislation to extend certain temporary tax provisions that are currently expired, including housing-related provisions that provide a tax exclusion for canceled mortgage debt and allow for the deductibility of mortgage insurance premiums, respectively. Housing and mortgage market conditions provide context for these and other issues that Congress may consider, although housing markets are local in nature and national housing market indicators do not necessarily accurately reflect conditions in specific communities. On a national basis, some key characteristics of owner-occupied housing markets and the mortgage market in recent years include increasing housing prices, low mortgage interest rates, and home sales that have been increasing but constrained by a limited inventory of homes on the market. Key characteristics of rental housing markets include an increasing number of renters, low rental vacancy rates, and increasing rents. Rising home prices and rents that have outpaced income growth in recent years have led to policymakers and others increasingly raising concerns about the affordability of both owner-occupied and rental housing. Affordability challenges are most prominent among the lowest-income renter households, reflecting a shortage of rental housing units that are both affordable and available to this population."], "all_classes": null, "length": 7818}
{"pred": " (One page)\nThe U.S. corporate income tax is based on worldwide economic activity. If all of a corporation's economic activity is in the United States, then tax administration and compliance is relatively straightforward. Many corporations, however, operate in several jurisdictions, which creates complications for tax administration and compliance. Further, corporations may actively choose where and how to organize to reduce their U.S. and worldwide tax liabilities. Some of these strategies have been referred to as expatriation, inversions, and mergers. This report begins with a brief discussion of relevant portions of the U.S. corporate income tax system before examining how inversions were commonly structured. The report then looks at how Congress and the Department of the Treasury have reduced the benefits of inversions. The report concludes with an examination of remaining methods for inverting and policy options available to prevent or limit these inversions. Achieving tax savings using an inversion became more difficult with the enactment of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (JOBS Act; P.L. 108-357 ). The JOBS Act denied or restricted the tax benefits of an inversion if the owners of the new company were not substantially different from the owners of the original company. The act also allowed a firm to invert only if it had substantial business operations in the country where the new headquarters was to be located. Although the 2004 legislation largely prevented the types of inversions that drew attention prior to its adoption, several companies have successfully inverted in the past few years by using the substantive business operations mechanism or merging. Treasury regulations have subsequently limited the former mechanism. In spring 2014, several high-profile companies indicated an interest in merging or plans to merge with a non-U.S. firm, including Pfizer, Chiquita, and Omnicom (an advertising firm). News reports indicated that a group of Walgreens investors was also urging such a move. Although the Pfizer and Omnicon mergers and Walgreens headquarters shifts ultimately did not take place, other firms announced mergers in the late spring and early summer. A number of firms in the medical device or pharmaceuticals fields announced mergers or proposed mergers with a shift of headquarters: Medtronics, Salix, AbbVie, Mylan, and Hospira. In August 2014, concern about inversions increased with the announcement that Burger King was in talks to merge with Tim Hortons, a Canadian firm, with the merged firm's headquarters in Canada. An agreement was announced on", "answers": ["News reports in the late 1990s and early 2000s drew attention to a phenomenon sometimes called corporate \"inversions\" or \"expatriations\": instances where U.S. firms reorganize their structure so that the \"parent\" element of the group is a foreign corporation rather than a corporation chartered in the United States. The main objective of these transactions was tax savings, and they involved little to no shift in actual economic activity. Bermuda and the Cayman Islands (countries with no corporate income tax) were the locations of many of the newly created parent corporations. These types of inversions largely ended with the enactment of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (JOBS Act; P.L. 108-357), which denied the tax benefits of an inversion if the original U.S. stockholders owned 80% or more of the new firm. The act effectively ended shifts to tax havens where no real business activity took place. However, two avenues for inverting remained. The act allowed a firm to invert if it has substantial business operations in the country where the new parent was to be located; the regulations at one point set a 10% level of these business operations. Several inversions using the business activity test resulted in Treasury regulations in 2012 that increased the activity requirement to 25%, effectively closing off this method. Firms could also invert by merging with a foreign company if the original U.S. stockholders owned less than 80% of the new firm. If the original U.S. shareholders owned less than 60%, the firm was not considered as inverting. Two features made a country an attractive destination: a low corporate tax rate and a territorial tax system that did not tax foreign source income. The U.K. joined countries such as Ireland, Switzerland, and Canada as targets for inverting when it adopted a territorial tax in 2009. At the same time, the U.K. also lowered its rate (from 25% to 20% by 2015). Inverted firms could reduce worldwide taxes by stripping taxable earnings out of the new U.S. subsidiary, largely through allocating debt to that subsidiary. Soon after, several high-profile companies indicated an interest in merging with a non-U.S. headquartered company, including Pfizer, Chiquita, AbbVie, and Burger King. This \"second wave\" of inversions again raised concerns about an erosion of the U.S. tax base. Chiquita and AbbVie canceled their plans in the wake of 2014 Treasury regulations, but Burger King and other firms completed merger plans. Pfizer subsequently terminated its planned merger with Allergan after Treasury regulations issued in 2016. Evidence suggests that these Treasury regulations have been an important factor in subsequently decreasing these merger-related inversions. Two policy options had been discussed in response: a general reform of the U.S. corporate tax and specific provisions to deal with tax-motivated international mergers. In December 2017, P.L. 115-97 (popularly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) lowered the corporate tax rate as part of broader tax reform which some argued would slow the rate of inversions. Other tax reform proposals suggested that if the United States moved to a territorial tax, the incentive to invert would be eliminated. There were concerns that a territorial tax could worsen the profit-shifting that already exists among multinational firms. P.L. 115-97, while moving in some ways to a territorial tax, also instituted a number of measures aimed at combatting profit shifting, including a global minimum tax on intangible income that limited the tax benefits of a territorial tax. The second option is to directly target inversions. The 2017 act included several provisions that discouraged inversions. In addition, further anti-inversion provisions have been introduced, most recently H.R. 5108 and S. 2459 in the 115th Congress, to treat all firms in which former U.S. shareholders have more than 50% ownership (or in which management and control is in the United States) as U.S. firms.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is about the costs of a UN peacekeeping operation compared to a hypothetical U.S. operation. It specifically mentions MINUSCA in the Central African Republic (CAR) as the case study.\n\nFirst, the report states that as of June 30, 2017, the UN had 71 peacekeeping operations since 1948, with 16 active ones. Eight of these were in sub-Saharan Africa. The report explains that UN peacekeeping has evolved from primarily military roles to multidimensional operations that include civilian and police personnel. These operations aim to protect civilians, assist in disarmament, support elections, and promote human rights. The UN's budget for peacekeeping in 2017 was $7.9 billion, with individual operations ranging from $36 million to over $1.2 billion. For example, the operation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) had a budget of more than $1.2 billion. The report also mentions that the United States is the largest financial contributor to UN peacekeeping operations, contributing an average of about $2.1 billion per year from fiscal years 2014 to 2017. The report then compares the costs of a hypothetical U.S. operation in CAR to the actual costs of MINUSCA. The estimated cost of the U.S. operation is nearly $5.7 billion, more than twice the UN cost for MINUSCA. The report explains that differences in costs are due to factors like the cost of sourcing and transporting equipment and supplies, staffing and compensating military and police personnel, and maintaining facilities and communications and intelligence systems. These differences reflect operational, structural, and doctrinal differences in the way the U.S. would undertake a hypothetical operation compared to the UN. The report also discusses the relative strengths of UN and U.S. peacekeeping operations. UN operations benefit from greater international and local acceptance, access to global expertise, and the ability to leverage assistance from multilateral donors and development banks. U.S. operations have faster deployment and superior command and control, logistics, intelligence, and counterterrorism capabilities. The report also mentions that the U.S. would need to pay more than twice the cost of the UN operation, which is due to factors like higher standards for facilities, communications, and medical care. The report concludes by stating", "answers": ["To promote international peace and security, the UN had 16 ongoing peacekeeping operations worldwide as of June 30, 2017, with a total budget of almost $8 billion in UN fiscal year 2017 and contributions of over 100,000 military, police, and civilian personnel from more than 120 countries. The United States is the largest financial contributor to UN peacekeeping operations, providing an average of about 28 percent of total funding annually. The Department of State Authorities Act, Fiscal Year 2017, includes a provision for GAO to compare the costs, strengths, and limitations of UN and U.S. peacekeeping operations. This report (1) compares the reported costs of a specific UN operation to the estimated costs of a hypothetical, comparable operation implemented by the United States; (2) identifies factors that affect cost differences; and (3) identifies stakeholder views on the relative strengths of UN and U.S. peacekeeping operations. GAO worked with the UN, DOD, and State to generate a cost estimate of a hypothetical U.S.-led operation in the Central African Republic comparable to MINUSCA. GAO developed this estimate using DOD's cost estimating tool for contingency operations and State data on civilian costs, assuming a U.S. operation using roughly the same levels of military and civilian personnel as MINUSCA. The cost estimate should not be construed as suggesting that the United States would likely implement such an operation in the Central African Republic or that it would implement such an operation in the same way. GAO is making no recommendations. Based on United Nations (UN) and Departments of Defense (DOD) and State (State) data, GAO estimates that it would cost the United States more than twice as much as it would cost the UN to implement a hypothetical operation comparable to the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA). MINUSCA cost the UN approximately $2.4 billion for the first 39 months of the operation. GAO estimates that a hypothetical U.S. peacekeeping operation in the Central African Republic of roughly the same size and duration would cost nearly $5.7 billion—almost eight times more than the $700 million the United States contributed to MINUSCA over the same time period. Various factors affect differences between the actual cost of MINUSCA and the estimated cost of a hypothetical, comparable U.S. operation in the Central African Republic. The United States and the UN would source and transport some supplies and equipment differently, affecting the cost of both operations; for example, the United States would airlift water into the Central African Republic, while the UN does not do so to the same extent. The United States also would incur the cost of civilian police and military reservist salaries, while the UN does not pay any troop or police salaries. Finally, some higher standards for facilities, intelligence, and medical services increase the U.S. cost estimate relative to UN costs for similar operational elements. UN and U.S. peacekeeping operations have various relative strengths, according to U.S. and UN officials. These officials said that, because the UN is a multilateral organization, UN peacekeeping operations have international acceptance and are more likely to be viewed as impartial. Officials also said that the UN enjoys global access to expertise and experience, and can leverage assistance from multilateral donors and development banks. Relative strengths of a U.S. peacekeeping operation would include faster deployment and superior command and control, logistics, intelligence, and counterterrorism capability, according to U.S. and UN officials."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5006}
{"pred": " The report provides an in-depth analysis of the U.S. Small Business Administration's (SBA) size standards, which are used to determine eligibility for SBA assistance. The Small Business Act of 1953 (P.L. 83-163, as amended) authorized the SBA and justified its existence on the grounds that small businesses are essential to the maintenance of the free enterprise system. Congress decided to allow the SBA to establish size standards to ensure that only small businesses were provided SBA assistance. Specifically, the Small Business Act of 1953 defines a small business as one that is organized for profit; has a place of business in the United States; operates primarily within the United States or makes a significant contribution to the U.S. economy through payment of taxes or use of American products, materials, or labor; is independently owned and operated; and is not dominant in its field on a national basis. The SBA uses two types of size standards to determine program eligibility: (1) industry-specific size standards and (2) alternative size standards based on the applicant's maximum tangible net worth and average net income after federal taxes. The SBA's industry-specific size standards are also used to determine eligibility for federal small business contracting purposes. The SBA currently uses two types of size standards to determine SBA program eligibility: (1) industry-specific size standards and (2) alternative size standards based on the applicant's maximum tangible net worth and average net income after federal taxes.

Although there is bipartisan agreement that the nation's small businesses play an important role in the American economy, there are differences of opinion concerning how to define them. The Small Business Act of 1953 (P.L. 83-163, as amended) authorized the SBA to establish size standards to ensure that only small businesses receive SBA assistance. The SBA currently uses two types of size standards to determine SBA program eligibility: industry-specific size standards and alternative size standards based on the applicant's maximum tangible net worth and average net income after federal taxes. The SBA's industry-specific size standards determine program eligibility for firms in 1,036 industrial classifications in 23 sub-industry activities described in the 2017 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The size standards are based on one of four measures: (1) number of employees, (2) average annual receipts in the previous three (may soon be the previous five) years, (3) average asset size as reported in the firm's four quarterly financial statements for the preceding year, or (4) a combination of number of employees and barrel per day refining capacity. Overall, about 97% of all employer firms qualify as small under the SBA's size standards. These firms represent about 30% of industry receipts. The SBA conducts an analysis of various economic factors, such as each industry's overall competitiveness and the competitiveness of firms within each industry, to determine its size standards. However, in the absence of precise statutory guidance and consensus on how to define small, the SBA's size standards have often been challenged, typically by industry representatives seeking to increase the number of firms eligible for assistance and by Members concerned that the size standards may not adequately target assistance to firms that they consider to be truly small. This report provides a historical examination of the SBA's size standards and assesses competing views concerning how to define a small business. It also discusses P.L. 111-240, the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, which authorized the SBA to establish an alternative size standard using maximum tangible net worth and average net income after federal taxes for both the 7(a) and 504/CDC loan guaranty programs; established, until the SBA acted, an interim alternative size standard for the 7(a) and 504/CDC programs of not more than $15 million in tangible net worth and not more than $5 million in average net income after federal taxes (excluding any carry-over losses) for the two full fiscal years before the date of the application; and required the SBA to conduct a detailed review of not less than one-third of the SBA's industry size standards every 18 months beginning on the new law's date of enactment (September 27, 2010) and ensure that each size standard is reviewed at least once every five years. P.L. 112-239, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, which directed the SBA not to limit the number of size standards and to assign the appropriate size standard to each NAICS industrial classification. This provision addressed the SBA's practice of limiting the number of size standards it used and combining size standards within industrial groups as a means to reduce the complexity of its size standards and to provide greater consistency for industrial classifications that have similar economic characteristics. P.L. 114-328, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, which authorizes the SBA to establish different size standards for agricultural enterprises using existing methods and appeal processes.

{"pred": " The report discusses the shift in employer-sponsored retirement plans from Defined Benefit (DB) plans to Defined Contribution (DC) plans over the last three decades. This shift has transferred certain types of risk, such as investment risk, from employers to employees. DB plans offer a fixed level of monthly annuitized retirement income based on a formula that usually takes into account factors such as a participant’s salary, years of service, and age at retirement, regardless of how the plan’s investments perform. In contrast, benefit levels in DC plans—such as 401(k) plans—depend on the contributions made to the plan and the performance of the investments in individual accounts, which may fluctuate in value. Some experts have suggested that the portability of DC plans makes them better-suited for a mobile workforce, and that such portability may lead to early withdrawals of retirement savings. The report also provides data on the number of DC and DB plans in the United States in 2016, as well as tax incentives for employers and employees to participate in plans. The report also discusses the role of plan sponsors in administering retirement plans, including the provision of services such as record keeping, investment management, and custodial or trustee services for plan assets. The report further highlights the tax incentives for individuals to save for retirement outside of an employer-sponsored plan, such as traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs. The report also discusses the role of the Department of Labor (DOL) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in overseeing and enforcing laws related to retirement plans. The report also provides information on the Form 5500, which is the primary source of information collected by the federal government regarding the operation, funding, expenses, and investments of employee benefit plans. The report further discusses the incidence and amount of early withdrawals of retirement savings, including the tax consequences for such withdrawals. The report also provides information on the factors that might lead individuals to access their retirement savings early, such as economic shocks, job loss, and financial stress. The report further discusses potential strategies or policies that might reduce the incidence and amount of early withdrawals of retirement savings, such as modifying existing rules to reduce early withdrawals, and implementing new strategies to achieve this. The report concludes that the incidence and amount of early withdrawals of retirement savings is a significant issue, and that the way plan sponsors treat outstanding loans after a participant separates from employment has the potential to adversely affect retirement savings. The report recommends that the Secretary of Labor direct the Assistant Secretary for EBSA, in coordination with", "answers": ["Federal law encourages individuals to save for retirement through tax incentives for 401(k) plans and IRAs—the predominant forms of retirement savings in the United States. In 2017, U.S. plans and IRAs reportedly held investments worth nearly $17 trillion dollars. Federal law also allows individuals to withdraw assets from these accounts under certain circumstances. DOL and IRS oversee 401(k) plans, and collect annual plan data—including financial information—on the Form 5500. For both IRAs and 401(k) plans, GAO was asked to examine: (1) the incidence and amount of early withdrawals; (2) factors that might lead individuals to access retirement savings early; and (3) policies and strategies that might reduce the incidence and amounts of early withdrawals. To answer these questions, GAO analyzed data from IRS, the Census Bureau, and DOL from 2013 (the most recent complete data available); and interviewed a diverse range of stakeholders identified in the literature, including representatives of companies sponsoring 401(k) plans, plan administrators, subject matter experts, industry representatives, and participant advocates. In 2013 individuals in their prime working years (ages 25 to 55) removed at least $69 billion (+/- $3.5 billion) of their retirement savings early, according to GAO's analysis of 2013 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Department of Labor (DOL) data. Withdrawals from individual retirement accounts (IRA)—$39.5 billion (+/- $2.1 billion)—accounted for much of the money removed early, were equivalent to 3 percent (+/- 0.15 percent) of the age group's total IRA assets, and exceeded their IRA contributions in 2013. Participants in employer-sponsored plans, like 401(k) plans, withdrew at least $29.2 billion (+/- $2.8 billion) early as hardship withdrawals, lump sum payments made at job separation (known as cashouts), and loan balances that borrowers did not repay. Hardship withdrawals in 2013 were equivalent to about 0.5 percent (+/-0.06 percent) of the age group's total plan assets and about 8 percent (+/- 0.9 percent) of their contributions. However, the incidence and amount of certain unrepaid plan loans cannot be determined because the Form 5500—the federal government's primary source of information on employee benefit plans—does not capture these data. Stakeholders GAO interviewed identified flexibilities in plan rules and individuals' pressing financial needs, such as out-of-pocket medical costs, as factors affecting early withdrawals of retirement savings. Stakeholders said that certain plan rules, such as setting high minimum loan thresholds, may cause individuals to take out more of their savings than they need. Stakeholders also identified several elements of the job separation process affecting early withdrawals, such as difficulties transferring account balances to a new plan and plans requiring the immediate repayment of outstanding loans, as relevant factors. Stakeholders GAO interviewed suggested strategies they believed could balance early access to accounts with the need to build long-term retirement savings. For example, plan sponsors said allowing individuals to continue to repay plan loans after job separation, restricting participant access to plan sponsor contributions, allowing partial distributions at job separation, and building emergency savings features into plan designs, could help preserve retirement savings (see figure). However, they noted, each strategy involves tradeoffs, and the strategies' broader implications require further study.

The report covers Georgia's history, political system, recent elections, economic situation, relations with Russia, and U.S. support.\n\nFirst, the historical context: Georgia was between empires and was incorporated into the Russian Empire in the 19th century. It had a brief independence in 1918, then was part of the USSR from 1921-1922. Georgia gained independence in 1991 after the Soviet Union collapsed. The country is located in the South Caucasus, between the Black and Caspian Seas, separated from Russia by the Greater Caucasus mountain range. The region also borders Iran and Turkey. There's a territorial conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, which is part of Azerbaijan but has a majority Armenian population. Georgia has unresolved conflicts with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which are supported by Russia. These regions have ethnic groups that identify more with the North Caucasus in Russia. After the 2008 war, Russia recognized these regions and stationed military forces there.\n\nNext, the political system: Georgia has a parliamentary system, with the prime minister as the most powerful executive. The president is commander in chief of the armed forces and can veto legislation and dissolve parliament under certain circumstances. The current prime minister is Mamuka Bakhtadze, who took office in June 2018. The president is Salome Zurabishvili, elected in November 2018. The parliamentary chairman is Irakli Kobakhidze. Georgia's legislature has 150 members elected by party list and majoritarian district. The ruling party, Georgian Dream, won a significant majority in 2016, leading to concerns about checks and balances. The party has had internal tensions, including disputes over judicial reforms. The party's leader, Bidzina Ivanishvili, remains influential behind the scenes. The party's leadership has faced criticism for various actions, including the judicial appointments dispute. The party's leadership has also had tensions with the presidency, as the former president, Giorgi Margvelashvili, fell out of favor with the party's leadership.\n\nThe political system includes a unicameral legislature with 150 members elected for four-year terms by two methods: 77 by party list and 7", "answers": ["Georgia is one of the United States' closest partners among the states that gained their independence after the USSR collapsed in 1991. With a history of strong economic aid and security cooperation, the United States has deepened its strategic partnership with Georgia since Russia's 2008 invasion of Georgia and 2014 invasion of Ukraine. U.S. policy expressly supports Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, and Georgia is a leading recipient of U.S. aid to Europe and Eurasia. Many observers consider Georgia to be one of the most democratic states in the post-Soviet region, even as the country faces ongoing governance challenges. The center-left Georgian Dream-Democratic Georgia party (GD) has close to a three-fourths supermajority in parliament and governs with limited checks and balances. Although Georgia faces high rates of poverty and underemployment, its economy in 2017 and 2018 appeared to show stronger growth than it had in the previous four years. The GD led a coalition to victory in parliamentary elections in 2012 amid growing dissatisfaction with the former ruling party, Mikheil Saakashvili's center-right United National Movement, which came to power as a result of Georgia's 2003 Rose Revolution. In August 2008, Russia went to war with Georgia to prevent Saakashvili's government from reestablishing control over the regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which broke away from Georgia in the early 1990s and became informal Russian protectorates. Congress has expressed firm support for Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-44, Title II, §253) states that the United States \"does not recognize territorial changes effected by force, including the illegal invasions and occupations\" of Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and other territories occupied by Russia. In September 2016, the House of Representatives passed H.Res. 660, which condemns Russia's military intervention and occupation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. In February 2019, the Georgia Support Act (H.R. 598), which originally passed the House by unanimous consent in the 115th Congress (H.R. 6219), was reintroduced in the 116th Congress. The act would express support for Georgia's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, as well as for its democratic development, Euro-Atlantic integration, and peaceful conflict resolution in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The United States provides substantial foreign and military aid to Georgia each year. Since 2010, U.S. nonmilitary aid to Georgia has totaled around $64 million a year on average, in addition to a five-year Millennium Challenge Corporation grant of $140 million to support education. In FY2019, Congress appropriated almost $90 million in nonmilitary aid to Georgia. Since 2010, U.S. military aid to Georgia has been estimated at around $68 million a year on average.

There were about 400 LTCHs across the nation in 2016. The 21st Century Cures Act included a provision for GAO to examine certain issues pertaining to LTCHs. This report examines (1) the health care needs of Medicare beneficiaries who receive services from the two qualifying hospitals; (2) how Medicare LTCH payment polices could affect the two qualifying hospitals; and (3) how the two qualifying hospitals compare with other LTCHs and other facilities that may treat Medicare patients with similar conditions. GAO analyzed the most recently available Medicare claims and other data for the two qualifying hospitals and other facilities that treat patients with spinal cord injuries. GAO also interviewed HHS officials and stakeholders from the qualifying hospitals, other facilities that treat spinal cord patients, specialty associations, and others. GAO provided a draft of this report to HHS. HHS provided technical comments, which were incorporated as appropriate. We also provided the two qualifying hospitals summaries of information we collected from them, to confirm the accuracy of statements included in our draft report. We incorporated their comments, as appropriate. Spinal cord injuries may result in secondary complications that often lead to decreased functional independence and quality of life. The 21st Century Cures Act changed how Medicare pays certain long-term care hospitals (LTCH) that provide spinal cord specialty treatment. For these hospitals, the act included a temporary exception from how Medicare pays other LTCHs. Two LTCHs—Craig Hospital in Englewood, Colorado and Shepherd Center in Atlanta, Georgia—have qualified for this exception. GAO found that most Medicare beneficiaries treated at these two hospitals typically receive specialized care for multiple chronic conditions and other long-term complications that develop after initial injuries, such as pressure ulcers that can result in life-threatening infection. The two hospitals also provide specialty care for acquired brain injuries, such as traumatic brain injuries. GAO's simulations of Medicare payments to these two hospitals using claims data from two baseline years—fiscal years 2013 and 2016—illustrate potential effects of payment policies. LTCHs are paid under a two-tiered system for care provided to beneficiaries: they receive the LTCH standard federal payment rate—or standard rate—for certain patients discharged from the LTCH, and a generally lower rate—known as a “site-neutral” rate—for all other discharges. Under the temporary exception, Craig Hospital and Shepherd Center receive the standard rate for all discharges during fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Assuming their types of discharges remain the same as in fiscal years 2013 and 2016, GAO's simulations of Medicare payments in the baseline years indicate: Most of the discharges we examined would not qualify for the standard rate, if the exception did not apply. Medicare payments would generally decrease under fiscal year 2020 payment policy, once the exception expires. However, the actual effects of Medicare's payment policies on these two hospitals could vary based on factors, including the severity of patient conditions (e.g., Medicare payment is typically higher for more severe injuries), and whether hospitals' discharges meet criteria for the standard rate. Similarities and differences may exist between the two qualifying hospitals and other facilities that treat Medicare patients with spinal cord and brain injuries. Patients with spinal cord and brain injuries may receive care in other LTCHs, but GAO found that most Medicare beneficiaries at these other LTCHs are treated for conditions other than spinal cord and brain injuries. Certain inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRF) also provide post-acute rehabilitation services to patients with spinal cord and brain injuries. While data limitations make a direct comparison between these facilities and the two qualifying hospitals difficult, GAO identified some similarities and differences. For example, officials from some IRFs we interviewed reported providing several of the same programs and services as the two qualifying hospitals to medically complex patients, but the availability of services and complexity of patients varied. Among other reasons, the different Medicare payment requirements that apply to LTCHs and IRFs affect the types of services they provide and the patients they treat."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8494}
{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1 inch margins)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points. The report is about Congressional Gold Medals, their history, how they are awarded, and the legislative process involved.\n\nFirst, the report mentions that since the late 1700s, Congress has awarded medals to express gratitude. The first were issued by the Continental Congress in 1776 for George Washington. These medals were meant to honor \"the highest achievements\" and were rare. The report explains that while there are no permanent statutory provisions for these medals, Congress has created them through special legislative actions. The process varies between the House and Senate, with the House having no specific rules, while the Senate has a rule requiring at least 67 cosponsors for a Congressional Gold Medal bill to be considered by the committee. However, this rule doesn't prevent the bill from being considered on the floor or passed without committee review. \n\nThe report also discusses the evolution of the medals. Initially, they were for military achievements, but over time, they've expanded to include nonmilitary heroic activities and work in various fields. Examples include Cornelius Vanderbilt for donating a steamship, Cyrus Field for the transatlantic cable, and Private George F. Robinson for saving Secretary of State William H. Seward from an assassination attempt. In the 20th and 21st centuries, the medals have been given to individuals in arts, athletics, aviation, diplomacy, entertainment, exploration, medicine, politics, religion, and science. Notable firsts include George M. Cohan as the first entertainer, Wilbur and Orville Wright as the first aeronautical pioneers, Lincoln Ellsworth as the first explorer, Major Walter Reed and associates as the first scientists, and Vice President Alben W. Barkley as the first political honoree.\n\nThe report then goes into the legislative process for these medals. It mentions that once a bill is introduced, it's typically referred to the House Committee on Financial Services or the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. The process varies between the House and Senate. In the House, there are currently no chamber or committee rules regarding the procedures for gold medal bills. In some past Congresses, the House Financial Services Committee had adopted a committee rule that prohibited its Domestic Monetary Policy and Technology Subcommittee from holding a hearing on commemorative medal legislation", "answers": ["Senators and Representatives are frequently asked to support or sponsor proposals recognizing historic events and outstanding achievements by individuals or institutions. Among the various forms of recognition that Congress bestows, the Congressional Gold Medal is often considered the most distinguished. Through this venerable tradition—the occasional commissioning of individually struck gold medals in its name—Congress has expressed public gratitude on behalf of the nation for distinguished contributions for more than two centuries. Since 1776, this award, which initially was bestowed on military leaders, has also been given to such diverse individuals as Sir Winston Churchill and Bob Hope, George Washington and Robert Frost, Joe Louis and Mother Teresa of Calcutta. Congressional gold medal legislation generally has a specific format. Once a gold medal is authorized, it follows a specific process for design, minting, and awarding. This process includes consultation and recommendations by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Commission (CCAC) and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (CFA), pursuant to any statutory instructions, before the Secretary of the Treasury makes the final decision on a gold medal's design. Once the medal has been struck, a ceremony will often be scheduled to formally award the medal to the recipient. In recent years, the number of gold medals awarded has increased, and some have expressed interest in examining the gold medal awarding process. Should Congress want to make such changes, several individual and institutional options might be available. The individual options include decisions made by Members of Congress as to what individual or groups might be honored; potential specification of gold medal design elements; and where gold medals for groups might be housed once the award is made. The institutional options could include House, Senate, or committee rules for the consideration of gold medal legislation and whether statutory standards on the number of gold medals issued per year or per Congress might be established for gold medals."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3411}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points. The report is about Cobra Dane and other radar systems, their capabilities, and how they contribute to various missions like ballistic missile defense, space surveillance, and intelligence gathering.\n\nFirst, the report mentions that Cobra Dane and other radars provide capabilities for different missions. They help track incoming missiles, classify threats, and determine if intercepts were successful. Some radars can also discriminate between real warheads and decoys. Additionally, radars contribute to space surveillance by tracking objects in Earth's orbit and their movements, capabilities, and intent. These capabilities depend on the radar's inherent abilities and location.\n\nThen there's a part about the management of Cobra Dane. The Air Force Space Command has overseen it since 2013, and the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center is responsible for its sustainment. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) works with the Air Force and combatant commands to develop, test, and field ballistic missile defense assets. They also share funding with the Air Force for Cobra Dane's operation and sustainment.\n\nThe report also discusses the roles of U.S. Northern Command and U.S. Strategic Command. Northern Command oversees the homeland ballistic missile defense mission and sets operational objectives for radar systems in its region. They are the end users for Cobra Dane. Strategic Command has established ballistic missile defense and space surveillance missions, both supported by Cobra Dane. They coordinate global missile defense and space operations planning.\n\nThere's a mention of the Air Force's January 2018 report to Congress, which discussed Cobra Dane and LRDR's capabilities. The report incorrectly stated that both radars could determine if a threat was intercepted successfully. MDA documentation shows that Cobra Dane does not have this capability yet, and it's unlikely to be implemented until 2025. The report also mentioned that LRDR would have a unique capability to discriminate missile threats from any deployed decoys once operational.\n\nAdditionally, the report talks about the locations of Cobra Dane and LRDR affecting their ability to contribute to the ballistic missile defense mission. For example, Cobra Dane's location at Shemya Island allows it to track missile threats from North Korea earlier in their trajectories than LRDR would be able to at Clear Air Force Station. This is due to the radar's location, which provides operational advantages and cost savings. The report also noted that the Pacific Radar may reduce DOD's reliance on Cobra", "answers": ["First fielded in 1976 on Shemya Island in Alaska, the Cobra Dane radar faces growing sustainment challenges that DOD plans to address through modernization projects. Anticipating future needs, DOD began investing in new radar systems that share capabilities with Cobra Dane to support ballistic missile defense and space surveillance, including the LRDR (Alaska), the Space Fence (Marshall Islands), and the Pacific Radar (location to be determined). The conference report accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision that GAO review the Air Force's report to Congress on the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane. This report identifies information included in the Air Force's report and describes additional information that GAO reviewed on (1) the capabilities of the Cobra Dane radar and other planned radars to meet DOD's mission requirements, (2) Cobra Dane's operational availability and the plan to mitigate the effect on those missions when Cobra Dane is not available, and (3) DOD's funding plan and project cost estimates for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane and its site at Shemya Island. GAO reviewed the Air Force report and related documentation, and interviewed relevant officials. In its January 2018 report to Congress, the Air Force reported how the Cobra Dane radar and the Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) have shared and unique capabilities to support ballistic missile defense and space surveillance missions. The report noted that the respective locations of both radar systems affect their ability to provide those capabilities. The Department of Defense (DOD) also has other radar investments—the Pacific Radar and the Space Fence, which, according to DOD officials, may reduce DOD's reliance on Cobra Dane to provide ballistic missile defense and space surveillance capabilities. The Air Force's report to Congress noted that Cobra Dane met its requirement for operational availability, which refers to the percentage of time that the radar is able to meet its missions. GAO found that the Air Force has developed procedures to mitigate risks when Cobra Dane is not available. For example, U.S. Northern Command and Missile Defense Agency (MDA) officials stated that they can mitigate risks when Cobra Dane is not available by using the Sea-Based X-band radar to provide support for ballistic missile defense. The Air Force would face some limitations in its ability to conduct space surveillance if Cobra Dane were not available, as Cobra Dane tracks objects no other radar can track. However, MDA officials noted there are no plans to take Cobra Dane offline long enough to compromise space surveillance. The Air Force and MDA plan to contribute total funding of $278.6 million for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane, according to their fiscal year 2019 budget plans. Specifically, the Air Force and MDA plan to share funding for the operation and maintenance of the Cobra Dane radar and for three modernization projects that make up their sustainment plan for the radar. Further, the Air Force report noted that the Air Force also plans to provide $140 million in funding for the sustainment and maintenance of operational access to Cobra Dane's site at Shemya Island. In addition, GAO found that the Air Force developed a total cost estimate for one project—known as the transmitter group replacement—but not for its other two projects. Air Force officials plan to complete cost estimates for those two projects in conjunction with their fiscal year 2020 budget submission."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3043}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this DEA report. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report is about the DEA's role in regulating the disposal of unused controlled substances. It mentions the Disposal Act of 2010, which allows the public to dispose of these substances through authorized collectors. The DEA is responsible for creating the regulations that implement this act. The regulations include disposal bins, mail-back programs, and take-back events. Law enforcement can use all three methods without DEA authorization. The Disposal Act also states that the regulations can't require an entity to participate in or establish any of the disposal options. \n\nEligible entities that can become authorized collectors include retail pharmacies, hospitals/clinics with an on-site pharmacy, narcotic treatment programs, reverse distributors, distributors, and drug manufacturers already authorized by DEA. These entities need to modify their DEA registration to become authorized collectors. The modification is free and simple. Once registered, they can install and maintain disposal bins in long-term care facilities as well as their own locations. \n\nThe disposal bins have specific requirements: securely fastened to a permanent structure, securely locked, constructed with a permanent outer container and removable inner liner, small opening for adding but not removing contents, prominent sign indicating acceptable substances, users must dispose of the drugs themselves without handing to staff, bin located where an employee is present and near where the substances are stored, inaccessible to public when employee is not present, inner liner must be waterproof, tamper-evident, tear-resistant, opaque, with size and ID number clearly labeled, installation and removal under supervision of two employees. \n\nThe destruction of the inner liners must comply with federal, state, and local laws, making the substances non-retrievable. Non-retrievable means the physical and chemical conditions are permanently altered, rendering the substances unavailable and unusable for all practical purposes. \n\nAuthorized collectors can destroy the inner liners on their premises if they have the capacity. Otherwise, they can transport the inner liners to a separate location for destruction. Typically, this is done by contracting with a reverse distributor. DEA regulations require that two reverse distributor employees transport the inner liners directly to the disposal location without unnecessary stops or extended stops. \n\nAuthorized collectors must document information including inner liner identification numbers and the dates that each liner is installed, removed, and transferred for destruction. These records must be kept for 2 years. \n\nThe report also discusses the participation rates of eligible entities in", "answers": ["In 2015, 3.8 million Americans reported misusing prescription drugs within the last month, and deaths from prescription opioids have more than quadrupled since 1999. About half of the people who reported misusing prescription drugs in 2015 received them from a friend or relative. One way to help prevent this kind of diversion and potential misuse is by providing secure and convenient ways to dispose of unused, unneeded, or expired prescription medications. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 authorizes pharmacies and other entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances to also collect unused prescription drugs for disposal. In 2014, DEA finalized regulations for the implementation of the Act, establishing a voluntary process for eligible entities to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs using disposal bins. GAO was asked to review participation among authorized collectors that maintain disposal bins. In this report GAO describes (1) participation rates among entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs and (2) factors that affect participation. GAO analyzed the most currently available DEA data from April 2017 on entities eligible to participate and those participating as authorized collectors. GAO also conducted interviews with DEA officials and a nongeneralizable sample of 11 stakeholder organizations selected to illustrate different types of authorized collectors and long-term care facilities. GAO is not making any recommendations. DEA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. GAO found that about 3 percent of pharmacies and other entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs for disposal have volunteered to do so. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) authorizes these entities to dispose of unused drugs to help reduce their potential misuse. Analysis of DEA data shows that as of April 2017, 2,233 of the 89,550 (2.49 percent) eligible entities—that is, certain entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances—had registered with DEA to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. Most—about 81 percent—of the authorized collectors were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics. GAO also found that participation rates varied by state, though in 44 states less than 5 percent of the state's pharmacies and other eligible entities had registered to become authorized collectors. Stakeholders cited several factors that may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have registered with DEA as authorized collectors of unused drugs. Most notably, stakeholders representing authorized collectors told GAO that because participation is voluntary, the cost associated with maintaining a disposal bin—which includes purchasing and installing the bin according to DEA requirements and paying for the destruction of its contents—is an important factor to weigh against potential benefits. DEA noted that availability of disposal by law enforcement agencies also contributes to low participation."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2930}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about the House of Representatives' suspension of rules procedure. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report explains that the House has standing rules for bills and resolutions. However, to speed up legislation, they can temporarily set aside these rules for measures not otherwise privileged. This is done through a special rule or a motion to suspend the rules and pass the measure. The suspension procedure allows nonprivileged measures to be raised without a special rule, waives points of order, limits debate, and prohibits floor amendments. The motion requires a two-thirds vote, so it's usually for bills that can meet that threshold. Most suspension measures are passed by the House, and the report provides data from the 114th Congress (2015-2016).\n\nFirst, I need to outline the main points of the report. The suspension of rules is a procedure that allows nonprivileged measures to be considered on the floor without a special rule. It's used for legislation that is broadly supported, and it waives certain rules that would impede a vote. The motion requires a two-thirds majority, so it's typically reserved for bills that can meet that threshold. Most suspension measures are passed by the House, and the report provides data on the number of measures considered under suspension during the 114th Congress.\n\nThe report also discusses the types of measures considered under suspension, such as bills, resolutions, and amendments. It mentions that most suspension measures are sponsored by members of the majority party, but minority-sponsored measures are more likely to be considered under suspension. The report includes statistical data on the prevalence and form of suspension measures, sponsors, committee consideration, length of floor debate, voting, and resolution of differences between the chambers. Table 1 summarizes the final legislative status of measures initially considered in the House under the suspension of the rules.

Let me structure it with an introduction, key points about the suspension procedure, data from the 114th Congress, and the outcomes of the measures.\n\nI should mention that the suspension procedure is used to pass nonprivileged measures without a special rule, allowing for a two-thirds majority. It", "answers": ["Suspension of the rules is the most commonly used procedure to call up measures on the floor of the House of Representatives. As the name suggests, the procedure allows the House to suspend its standing and statutory rules in order to consider broadly supported legislation in an expedited manner. More specifically, the House temporarily sets aside its rules that govern the raising and consideration of measures and assumes a new set of constraints particular to the suspension procedure. The suspension of the rules procedure has several parliamentary advantages: (1) it allows nonprivileged measures to be raised on the House floor without the need for a special rule, (2) it enables the consideration of measures that would otherwise be subject to a point of order, and (3) it streamlines floor action by limiting debate and prohibiting floor amendments. Given these features, as well as the required two-thirds supermajority vote for passage, suspension motions are generally used to process less controversial legislation. In the 114th Congress (2015-2016), measures considered under suspension made up 62% of the bills and resolutions that received floor action in the House (743 out of 1,200 measures). The majority of suspension measures were House bills (83%), followed by Senate bills (11%) and House resolutions (4%). The measures covered a variety of policy areas but most often addressed government operations, such as the designation of federal facilities or amending administrative policies. Most measures that are considered in the House under the suspension procedure are sponsored by a House or Senate majority party member. However, suspension is the most common House procedure used to consider minority-party-sponsored legislation regardless of whether the legislation originated in the House or Senate. In 2015 and 2016, minority-party members sponsored 31% of suspension measures, compared to 9% of legislation subject to different procedures, including privileged business (17 measures), unanimous consent (21 measures), and under the terms of a special rule (one Senate bill). Most suspension measures are referred to at least one House committee before their consideration on the floor. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform (now called the Committee on Oversight and Reform) was the committee of primary jurisdiction for the plurality of suspension measures considered in the 114th Congress. Additional committees—such as Energy and Commerce, Homeland Security, Natural Resources, Foreign Affairs, and Veterans' Affairs—also served as the primary committee for a large number of suspension measures. Suspension motions are debatable for up to 40 minutes. In most cases, only a fraction of that debate time is actually used. In the 114th Congress, the average amount of time spent considering a motion to suspend the rules was 13 minutes and 10 seconds. The House adopted nearly every suspension motion considered in 2015 and 2016. Approval by the House, however, did not guarantee final approval in the 114th Congress. The Senate passed or agreed to 40% of the bills, joint resolutions, and concurrent resolutions initially considered in the House under suspension of the rules, and 276 measures were signed into law. This report briefly describes the suspension of the rules procedure, which is defined in House Rule XV, and provides an analysis of measures considered under this procedure during the 114th Congress.

{"pred": " The National Cemeteries Act of 1973 established the modern veterans’ cemetery system, managed by the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). NCA is responsible for maintaining existing national cemeteries and constructing new ones to serve veterans and their families. Since 1978, NCA has also provided funding through the Veterans Cemetery Grants Program (Grants Program) to help establish, expand, or improve state and tribal veterans’ cemeteries. States and tribal governments seeking funding from the Grants Program must apply to the VA. Any cemetery established, expanded, or improved through funding from the Grants Program must be maintained and operated in accordance with NCA’s operational standards. Veterans from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and some U.S. territories are served by national, state, or tribal cemeteries. NCA has revised its policies and procedures to better fulfill its mission to serve and honor veterans and their family members. For example, in 2011 NCA lowered its policy threshold for establishing new national cemeteries from an area having at least 170,000 veterans who are unserved by burial options to an area having 80,000 unserved veterans. This revised minimum veteran population threshold was chosen based on data showing that state veterans’ cemeteries funded through VA’s Grants Program were located in areas that typically served a maximum of 80,000 veterans within a 75-mile service area. According to VA documentation, moving to this lower threshold has enabled the agency to establish new national cemeteries in areas where states may not have been willing to place them because of the size and cost of operating a larger state veterans’ cemetery. NCA’s plan includes establishing 18 new national cemeteries—comprised of five traditional national cemeteries and 13 urban and rural initiative national cemeteries—and awarding funds for new state veterans’ cemeteries. In 2014, NCA estimated approximately 90 percent of the veteran population had reasonable access to burial options, and that it expected to reach its strategic goal of providing reasonable access to 96 percent of veterans by the end of fiscal year 2017.

Within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) has a plan to establish 18 new national cemeteries to increase reasonable access to burial options for veterans. NCA defines reasonable access as a national or state veterans' cemetery being located within 75 miles of veterans' homes. Key parts of NCA's plan include establishing 13 urban and rural initiative national cemeteries and awarding grant funds to state applicants for establishing new state veterans' cemeteries. NCA has made limited progress in implementing its plan to increase burial access and is years behind its original schedule for opening new cemeteries. For example, NCA has opened only two of its planned urban and rural initiative sites and is behind its original schedule for the other 11 (see fig. below). The primary factor delaying NCA's completion of these cemeteries has been challenges in acquiring suitable land. NCA has also been challenged in producing accurate estimates of construction costs for most of its rural initiative sites. Cost estimates have increased more than 200 percent (from about $7 million to $24 million) for these sites, and NCA's guidance for developing cost estimates for the cemeteries does not fully incorporate the 12 steps identified in cost-estimating leading practices—such as conducting a risk and uncertainty analysis or a sensitivity analysis. As a result, NCA is not well positioned to provide reliable and valid cost estimates to better inform decisions to enhance veterans' cemetery access.

It also discusses the responsibilities of state and local governments in these areas, including the distribution of duties and the structures of the election systems. The report provides examples of past federal actions on election administration, such as the Help America Vote Act of 2002, and discusses how these actions have affected the implementation of election laws.

Elections are primarily administered by thousands of state and local systems rather than a single, unified national system. States and localities share responsibility for most election administration duties. Exactly how responsibilities are assigned at the state and local levels varies both between and within states, but there are some general patterns in the distribution of duties. States typically have primary responsibility for making decisions about the rules of elections (policymaking). Localities typically have primary responsibility for conducting elections in accordance with those rules (implementation). Localities, with varying contributions from states, typically also have primary responsibility for paying for the activities and resources required to conduct elections (funding). The structures of the state and local systems that conduct elections also vary between and within states. Common variations include differences related to the leadership of the system, the relationship between local election officials and the state, and the population size and density of the jurisdiction the system serves. The leadership of a state or local election system may be elected or appointed, and both the leaders and the methods used to select them may be partisan, bipartisan, or nonpartisan. State officials may have more or less direct influence over local election officials, and the extent of their influence may be affected by other structural features of the state's election systems, such as the methods used to select local officials. Finally, larger election jurisdictions have different administrative advantages and challenges than smaller ones, and more urban jurisdictions have different advantages and challenges than more rural ones. These differences between jurisdictions may be reflected in structural features of the election systems that serve them, such as how the systems allocate resources and where they find specialized expertise. Understanding the duties and structures of state and local election systems may be relevant to Congress for at least two reasons.

{"pred": " The report discusses the progress in grade-crossing safety since 1975, highlighting a significant reduction in crashes and fatalities. From 1975 to 1985, the most dangerous crossings were closed or improved, leading to a substantial decrease in crashes and fatalities. However, since 2009, the number of crashes and fatalities has plateaued, with approximately 2,100 crashes and 250 fatalities annually. These fatalities account for less than one percent of all highway-related fatalities. The decrease in crashes and fatalities occurred as the volume of train and highway traffic generally increased over the years. FRA expects the traffic volumes to continue to increase and has expressed concern that grade-crossing crashes and fatalities may also increase. The Section 130 Program provides funds to state DOTs for the elimination of hazards at highway-rail grade crossings. States determine what improvements need to be made at grade crossings. FHWA has oversight responsibilities regarding the use of federal funds as part of its administration of federal-aid highway programs and funding, including HSIP funds. FHWA uses a statutory formula to distribute to states Section 130 Program funds, which averaged $235 million per year during the last 10 years (fiscal years 2009 through 2018). Section 130 Program projects are funded at a 90 percent federal share, with the state or the roadway authority funding the remaining 10 percent. States have 4 years to obligate their program funds before they expire, meaning that in any given fiscal year, states can obligate funds appropriated in that year as well as any unobligated funds from the previous 3 fiscal years. In addition, states may choose to combine funds from multiple years to fund relatively expensive projects. The Section 130 Program’s requirements direct states to establish an implementation schedule for grade-crossing-safety improvement projects that, at a minimum, include warning signs for all public grade crossings. Grade crossings are generally categorized as “active” or “passive” depending on the type of traffic control devices that are present. As of July 2018, according to FRA’s National Highway-Rail Crossing Inventory, there were approximately 68,000 public grade crossings with electronic, or active, traffic control devices in the United States. Another approximately 58,000 public grade crossings have passive traffic-control devices, which include signs and supplementary pavement markings. The requirements", "answers": ["Crashes at highway-rail grade crossings are one of the leading causes of railroad-related deaths. According to FRA data, in 2017, there were more than 2,100 crashes resulting in 273 fatalities. Since 2009 crashes have occurred at a fairly constant rate. The federal government provides states funding to improve grade-crossing safety through FHWA's Section 130 Program. The persistence of crashes and deaths raises questions about the effectiveness of the federal grade-crossing-safety program. GAO was asked to review federal efforts to improve grade-crossing safety. This report examines: (1) the focus of FRA's grade-crossing-safety research, (2) how states select and implement grade-crossing projects and what data are available from FRA to inform their decisions, and (3) the challenges states reported in implementing and assessing projects and the extent to which FHWA assesses the program's effectiveness. GAO analyzed FRA data; reviewed FRA's, FHWA's, and states' documents; reviewed a study of states' selection of projects; and interviewed FRA and FHWA headquarters and field staff, and officials from a non-generalizable sample of eight states, selected to include a mix in the number of grade crossings and crashes, and geographic diversity. Research sponsored by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has identified driver behavior as the main cause of highway-rail grade crossing crashes and that factors such as train and traffic volume can contribute to the risk of a crash. (See figure.) Over 70 percent of fatal crashes in 2017 occurred at grade crossings with gates. To meet the requirements of the federal grade-crossing program, states are responsible for selecting and ensuring the implementation of grade-crossing improvement projects. Most state DOT officials and other relevant transportation officials use local knowledge of grade crossings to supplement the results of models that rank grade crossings based on the risk of an accident. These states generally consider the same primary risk factors, such as vehicle and train traffic. FRA is taking steps to improve the data used in its model to help states assess risk factors at grade crossings. For example, FRA's grade-crossing inspectors will review and identify issues with railroad- and state-reported inventory data. FRA is currently developing guidelines, which it plans to finalize by the end of 2018, to implement these inspections as it has for other types of FRA inspections. Officials we spoke with in eight states reported challenges in pursuing certain types of projects that could further enhance safety, in part because of federal requirements. While safety has improved, many crashes occur at grade crossings with gates, and officials said there could be additional ways to focus program requirements to continue improving safety. States' and the Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) reporting focuses on the program's funding and activity, such as the number and types of projects, yet the low number of crashes makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of projects in reducing crashes and fatalities. FHWA reports the program has been effective in reducing fatalities by about 74 percent since 1975. However, since 2009, annually there have been about 250 fatalities—almost one percent of total highway fatalities. FRA expects future crashes to grow, in part, due to the anticipated increase in rail and highway traffic. An evaluation of the program should consider whether its funding and other requirements allow states to adequately address ongoing safety issues. FHWA officials said they are not required to perform such evaluations. GAO has previously reported on the importance of program evaluations to determine the extent to which a program is meeting its objectives.

Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points.\n\nThe report discusses how the criteria for the Purple Heart have changed over time, especially in response to new military, political, or social conditions. There's a lot of debate, particularly with veterans groups, about who should be eligible for the award. Congress has considered several pieces of legislation to change eligibility, especially for the Purple Heart. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have increased the number of servicemembers receiving the Purple Heart and the potential conditions under which they receive it. Conditions like traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as accidents while deployed, are raising new questions about when a servicemember deserves a Purple Heart. The 2015 shooting in Chattanooga, TN, brought up questions about applying the Purple Heart to terrorist attacks versus criminal acts. Veterans groups often voice their views when Congress or the President proposes changes to expand eligibility for the Purple Heart. They argue, for example, that a servicemember who acquires PTSD may not always deserve the same recognition as a servicemember killed or wounded in direct combat, while others contend that these medical conditions can debilitate servicemembers just as much as physical injuries and can have lasting effects on their lives. The debate centers on whether expanding eligibility does a disservice to those who have already earned the award. Congress has traditionally left many military award requirements to the executive branch, but the Constitution allows Congress to act in this area. Events have prompted changes regarding eligibility for the Purple Heart. The NDAA for FY2015 expanded eligibility by redefining what should be considered an attack by a \"foreign terrorist organization\" for purposes of determining eligibility for the Purple Heart. As a result, servicemembers wounded and killed in the 2009 shootings in Little Rock, AR, and at Fort Hood, TX, were awarded Purple Hearts in 2015. The report also covers the history of the Purple Heart, starting with George Washington's Badge of Military Merit in 1782, which was later revived by MacArthur in 1932. There's a lot of legislation over the years, like the 1942 expansion to include Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, the 1952 retroactive award, and the 1962 expansion to include civilians. The", "answers": ["The Purple Heart is one of the oldest and most recognized American military medals, awarded to servicemembers who were killed or wounded by enemy action. The conflicts 2001 to the present have greatly increased the number of Purple Hearts awarded to servicemembers. Events over the past few years have spurred debate on the eligibility criteria for the Purple Heart. Shootings on U.S. soil and medical conditions such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have prompted changes to the eligibility requirements for the Purple Heart. Some critics believe that these changes may lessen the value of the medal and the sacrifices of past recipients on the battlefield. In the past, efforts to modify the Purple Heart's eligibility requirements were contentious, and veterans groups were vocal concerning eligibility changes. While medal requirements are often left to the military and executive branch to decide, Congress is involved in Purple Heart eligibility, utilizing its constitutional power \"To Make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces\" (U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8, clause 14). The Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (P.L. 113-291) included language that expands eligibility for the Purple Heart. Previous debates have raised several questions about the Purple Heart. In some respects, how an event is defined can determine eligibility: Is a servicemember the victim of a crime or a terrorist attack? Conversely, arguing that killed or wounded servicemembers \"should\" be eligible for the Purple Heart can redefine an event: Is the servicemember an advisor to a foreign military or a combatant? Are PTSD and other mental health conditions adequate injuries to warrant the Purple Heart? These are questions that Congress might consider if it chooses to act on this issue."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4754}
{"pred": " The report outlines the structure and responsibilities of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) in administering the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). FNS is responsible for creating regulations, ensuring state compliance, and authorizing and monitoring retailers. States handle eligibility, benefit calculations, and investigations. SNAP recipients, generally aged 16 to 59, must comply with work requirements unless exempt. These include registering for work, reporting to an employer if referred, accepting a suitable job, not voluntarily quitting or reducing work hours below 30 hours per week, and participating in a SNAP E&T program or a workfare program. Exemptions include being physically or mentally unfit, responsible for a dependent child under 6 or an incapacitated person, employed for 30 or more hours per week, or a bona fide student enrolled half-time or more in a recognized school or institution of higher education. ABAWDs, who are able-bodied adults without dependents, face additional work requirements, including working 20 hours per week or participating in a work program. Failure to comply may result in benefit loss. FNS has taken steps to increase federal support of states' SNAP E&T programs by increasing the number of federal staff responsible for SNAP E&T and providing additional technical assistance to states. Specifically, FNS officials said that in 2014, they created the Office of Employment and Training to provide support and oversight for the SNAP E&T program and expanded SNAP E&T staff in FNS headquarters from one to five full-time employees. FNS has also taken steps to increase technical assistance to states. For example, they have developed tools, including the SNAP E&T Operations Handbook, intended to help states implement and grow their program, and by adding a dedicated SNAP E&T official in each of FNS’s seven regional offices. The report also discusses the work requirements for SNAP recipients, including the work registration process, and the various exemptions. It highlights the challenges faced by states in conducting fraud investigations due to reduced or stagnant staff levels while the number of SNAP recipients has greatly increased. The report further discusses the federal requirements for state SNAP E&T programs, including who to serve and what services to offer. It also highlights the changes in how states design their programs, such as moving from mandatory to voluntary programs, focusing on serving ABAWDs, and partnering with other organizations to deliver services. The report includes data on the number of SNAP recipients and work registrants participating in SNAP E&T programs, noting a", "answers": ["SNAP is the largest federally funded nutrition assistance program. In fiscal year 2017, it provided about $63 billion in benefits. USDA and the states jointly administer SNAP and partner to address issues that affect program integrity, including improper payments and fraud. GAO has previously reported on various aspects of SNAP, including state SNAP E&T programs, improper payment rates, recipient fraud, and retailer trafficking. This testimony discusses GAO's prior and ongoing work on (1) SNAP E&T programs, including program participants, design, and USDA oversight, and (2) USDA's efforts to address SNAP program integrity, including improper payments, as well as recipient and retailer fraud. As part of its ongoing work on SNAP E&T programs, GAO analyzed E&T expenditures and participation data from fiscal years 2007 through 2016, the most recent data available; reviewed relevant research from USDA; and interviewed USDA and selected state and local officials. The prior work discussed in this testimony is based on four GAO products on E&T programs (GAO-03-388), improper payments (GAO-16-708T), recipient fraud (GAO-14-641), and retailer trafficking (GAO-07-53). Information on the scope and methodology of our prior work is available in each product. Overseen by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and administered by states, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Employment and Training (E&T) programs served about 0.5 percent of the approximately 43.5 million SNAP recipients in an average month of fiscal year 2016, according to the most recent USDA data available. These programs are generally designed to help SNAP recipients increase their ability to obtain regular employment through services such as job search and training. Some recipients may be required to participate. According to USDA, about 14 percent of SNAP recipients were subject to work requirements in an average month of fiscal year 2016, while others, such as children and the elderly, were generally exempt from these requirements. States have flexibility in how they design their E&T programs. Over the last several years, states have 1) increasingly moved away from programs that mandate participation, 2) focused on serving able-bodied adults without dependents whose benefits are generally time-limited unless they comply with work requirements, and 3) partnered with state and local organizations to deliver services. USDA has taken steps to increase support and oversight of SNAP E&T since 2014, including collecting new data on participant outcomes from states. GAO has ongoing work reviewing SNAP E&T programs, including USDA oversight. USDA and the states partner to address issues that affect program integrity, including improper payments and fraud, and USDA has taken some steps to address challenges in these areas, but issues remain. Improper Payments. In 2016, GAO reviewed SNAP improper payment rates and found that states' adoption of program flexibilities and changes in federal SNAP policy in the previous decade, as well as improper payment rate calculation methods, likely affected these rates. Although USDA reported improper payment estimates for SNAP in previous years, USDA did not report an estimate for benefits paid in fiscal years 2015 or 2016 due to data quality issues in some states. USDA has since been working with the states to improve improper payment estimates for the fiscal year 2017 review. Recipient Fraud. In 2014, GAO made recommendations to USDA to address challenges states faced in combatting recipient fraud. For example, GAO found that USDA's guidance on the use of transaction data to uncover potential trafficking lacked specificity and recommended USDA develop additional guidance. Since then, USDA has provided technical assistance to some states, including on the use of data analytics. GAO has ongoing work reviewing states' use of data analytics to identify SNAP recipient fraud. Retailer Trafficking. In 2006, GAO identified several ways in which SNAP was vulnerable to retailer trafficking—a practice involving the exchange of benefits for cash or non-food items. For example, USDA had not conducted analyses to identify high-risk retailers and target its resources. Since then, USDA has established risk levels for retailers based on various factors. GAO has ongoing work assessing how USDA prevents, detects, and responds to retailer trafficking and reviewing the usefulness of USDA's estimates of the extent of SNAP retailer trafficking. GAO is not making new recommendations. USDA generally concurred with GAO's prior recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5657}
{"pred": " The report discusses the growing interest in liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a maritime fuel, driven by the need for less polluting fuels in international shipping. While LNG has been used as a secondary fuel in tanker ships for decades, using it as a primary fuel is a relatively new endeavor. The first LNG-powered vessel, a Norwegian ferry, began service in 2000. The report highlights several aspects of LNG use in shipping that may be of congressional interest. LNG as an engine, or \"bunker,\" fuel could help the United States reduce harmful air emissions, it could create a new market for domestic natural gas, and it could create economic opportunities in domestic shipbuilding. However, U.S. ports would need specialized vessels and land-based infrastructure for LNG \"bunkering\" (vessel refueling) as well as appropriate regulatory oversight of the associated shipping and fueling operations. The storage, delivery, and use of LNG in shipping also has safety implications. These and other aspects of LNG bunkering may become legislative or oversight issues for Congress. One bill in the 115th Congress, the Waterway LNG Parity Act of 2017 (S. 505), would have imposed excise taxes on LNG used by marine vessels on inland waterways. The report discusses impending International Maritime Organization (IMO) standards limiting the maximum sulfur content in shipping fuels, the market conditions in which LNG may compete to become a common bunker fuel for vessel operators, and the current status of LNG bunkering globally and in the United States. The report also discusses the potential economic opportunities for the United States, including the creation of a new market for domestic natural gas, shipbuilding, and infrastructure development. However, the report also highlights potential challenges, such as increased natural gas prices for domestic consumers and the environmental impact of increased natural gas production and transportation. The report concludes that the future of LNG as a ship fuel is uncertain, and it may take several decades for significant benefits to be realized. Therefore, Congress may need to consider various legislative and oversight initiatives to support the growth of LNG bunkering in the United States.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is about the use of LNG as a maritime fuel, driven by the need for less polluting fuels in international shipping. It mentions that LNG has been used as a secondary fuel in tanker ships for decades, but using it as a primary fuel is", "answers": ["The combination of growing liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies and new requirements for less polluting fuels in the maritime shipping industry has heightened interest in LNG as a maritime fuel. The use of LNG as an engine (\"bunker\") fuel in shipping is also drawing attention from federal agencies and is beginning to emerge as an issue of interest in Congress. In 2008, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) announced a timeline to reduce the maximum sulfur content in vessel fuels to 0.5% by January 1, 2020. Annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships requires vessels to either use fuels containing less than 0.5% sulfur or install exhaust-cleaning systems (\"scrubbers\") to limit a vessel's airborne emissions of sulfur oxides to an equivalent level. An option for vessel operators to meet the IMO 2020 standards is to install LNG-fueled engines, which emit only trace amounts of sulfur. Adopting LNG engines requires more investment than installing scrubbers, but LNG-fueled engines may offset their capital costs with operating cost advantages over conventional fuels. Savings would depend on the price spread between LNG and fuel oil. Recent trends suggest that LNG may be cheaper in the long run than conventional fuels. LNG bunkering requires specialized infrastructure for supply, storage, and delivery to vessels. To date, the number of ports worldwide that have developed such infrastructure is limited, although growth in this area has accelerated. Early adoption of LNG bunkering is occurring in Europe where the European Union requires a core network of ports to provide LNG bunkering by 2030. LNG bunkering is also advancing in Asia, led by Singapore, the world's largest bunkering port. Asian countries, together with Australia and the United Arab Emirates, have about 10 coastal ports offering LNG bunkering, with another 15 projects in development. LNG bunkering in the United States currently takes place in Jacksonville, FL, and Port Fourchon, LA—with a third facility under development in Tacoma, WA. Bunkering of LNG-fueled cruise ships using barges also is planned for Port Canaveral, FL. The relative locations of other U.S. ports and operating LNG terminals suggest that LNG bunkering could be within reach of every port along the Eastern Seaboard and in the Gulf of Mexico. On the West Coast, the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, CA, are near the Costa Azul LNG terminal in Ensenada, MX. Seattle and Tacoma are adjacent to the proposed Tacoma LNG project. Since 2015, Jones Act coastal ship operators have taken steps to transition their fleets to use cleaner burning fuels, including LNG. Shippers of dry goods to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico have taken delivery or have ordered LNG-fueled and LNG-capable vessels from U.S. shipyards in Philadelphia, PA, and Brownsville, TX. Another company operates five LNG-powered offshore supply vessels built in Gulfport, MS. Depending upon LNG conversions, the global LNG bunker fuel market could grow to several billion dollars by 2030. If U.S. LNG producers were to supply a significant share of this market—on the strength of comparatively low LNG production costs—LNG bunkering could increase demand for U.S. natural gas production, transportation, and liquefaction. Opportunities in LNG-related shipbuilding might be more limited, as most shipbuilding occurs overseas, although domestically-constructed LNG bunkering barges could be one area of economic growth. Finally, engineering and construction firms could benefit from new opportunities to develop port infrastructure for LNG storage and transfer. However, while vessel conversion to LNG fuel may increase demand for U.S.-produced natural gas, it partially could be offset by reduced demand for U.S.-produced crude oil or refined products. Furthermore, while LNG can reduce direct emissions from vessels, fugitive emissions and environmental impacts from natural gas production and transportation could reduce overall emissions benefits. While the LNG industry has experienced few accidents, the Coast Guard has been developing new standards to address unique safety and security risks associated with LNG in vessel operations. The overarching consideration about LNG bunkering in the United States is uncertainty about how the global shipping fleet will adapt to the IMO sulfur standards over time. This uncertainty complicates decisions related to both private investment and public policy. Although Congress has limited ability to influence global shipping, it could influence the growth of LNG bunkering through the tax code and regulation, or through policies affecting the LNG industry or domestic shipping industry as a whole. Evaluating the potential implications of LNG bunkering within the context of broader energy and environmental policies may become an additional consideration for Congress. If LNG bunkering expands significantly, Congress also may examine the adequacy of existing measures to ensure the safety and security of LNG vessels, storage, and related facilities."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8129}

Lead can leach into water from plumbing materials inside a school. The discovery of toxic levels of lead in water in Flint, Michigan, in 2015 has renewed awareness about the danger lead exposure poses to public health, especially for children. GAO was asked to review school practices for lead testing and remediation. This report examines the extent to which (1) school districts are testing for, finding, and remediating lead in drinking water; (2) states are supporting these efforts; and (3) federal agencies are supporting state and school district efforts. GAO administered a web-based survey to a stratified, random sample of 549 school districts, the results of which are generalizable to all school districts. GAO visited or interviewed officials with 17 school districts with experience in lead testing, spread among 5 states, selected for geographic variation. GAO also interviewed federal and state officials and reviewed relevant laws and documents. An estimated 43 percent of school districts, serving 35 million students, tested for lead in school drinking water in 2016 or 2017, according to GAO's nationwide survey of school districts. An estimated 41 percent of school districts, serving 12 million students, had not tested for lead. GAO's survey showed that, among school districts that did test, an estimated 37 percent found elevated lead (lead at levels above their selected threshold for taking remedial action.) (See figure.) All school districts that found elevated lead in drinking water reported taking steps to reduce or eliminate exposure to lead, including replacing water fountains, installing filters or new fixtures, or providing bottled water. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), at least 8 states have requirements that schools test for lead in drinking water as of 2017, and at least 13 additional states supported school districts' voluntary efforts with funding or in-kind support for testing and remediation. In addition, the five states GAO visited provided examples of technical assistance to support testing in schools. EPA provides guidance and other resources to states and school districts regarding testing and remediating lead in drinking water, and the Department of Education (Education) provides some of this information on its websites. School district officials that used EPA's written guidance said they generally found it helpful. Although EPA guidance emphasizes the importance of addressing elevated lead levels, GAO found that some aspects of the guidance, such as the threshold for taking remedial action, were potentially misleading and unclear, which can put school districts at risk of making uninformed decisions. In addition, many school districts reported a lack of familiarity with EPA's guidance, and their familiarity varied by region of the country. Education and EPA do not regularly collaborate to support state and school district efforts on lead in drinking water, despite agreeing to do so in a 2005 memorandum of understanding. Such collaboration could encourage testing and ensure that more school districts will have the necessary information to limit student and staff exposure to lead.

Under certain circumstances, DOD can enter into an other transaction (OT) agreement instead of a traditional contract. OT agreements are generally exempt from federal procurement laws and regulations. These exemptions grant government officials the flexibility to include, amend, or exclude contract clauses and requirements that are mandatory in traditional procurements (e.g., termination clauses, cost accounting standards, payments, audit requirements, intellectual property, and contract disputes). OT authorities also grant more flexibility to structure agreements in numerous ways, including joint ventures; partnerships; consortia; or multiple agencies joining together to fund an agreement encompassing multiple providers. Other transaction agreements are legally binding contracts; they are referred to as agreements to distinguish them from the traditional procurement contracts governed by the FAR and procurements laws. Other transaction authorities are set forth in two sections of law: 10 U.S.C. 2371—granting authority to use OTs for basic, applied, and advanced research projects. 10 U.S.C. 2371b—granting authority to use OTs for prototype projects and follow-on production. Under this authority, a prototype project can only be conducted if at least one nontraditional defense contractor significantly participates in the project; all significant participants are small businesses or nontraditional defense contractors; at least one-third of the total cost of the prototype project is provided by nongovernment participants; or the senior procurement acquisition official provides a written justification for using an OT. Follow-on production can only be conducted when the underlying prototype OT was competitively awarded, and the prototype project was successfully completed. OTs have the potential to provide significant benefits to DOD, including attracting nontraditional contractors with promising technological capabilities to work with DOD, establishing a mechanism to pool resources with other entities to facilitate development of, and obtain, state-of-the-art dual-use technologies, and offering a unique mechanism for DOD to invest in, and influence the direction of, technology development. A number of analysts warn that along with the potential benefits come significant risks, including potentially diminished oversight and exemption from laws and regulations designed to protect government and taxpayer interests. In FY2017, DOD obligated $2.1 billion on prototype OT agreements, representing less than 1% of contract obligations for the year. However, the use of OTs is expected to grow at a rapid pace, due in part to recent statutory changes expanding other transaction authorities.

Intentional intrusions into government and private computer networks and inadequate corporate privacy and cybersecurity practices have exposed the personal information of millions of Americans to unwanted recipients. At the same time, internet connectivity has increased and varied in form in recent years. Americans now transmit their personal data on the internet at an exponentially higher rate than in the past, and their data are collected, cultivated, and maintained by a growing number of both \"consumer facing\" and \"behind the scenes\" actors such as data brokers. As a consequence, the privacy, cybersecurity and protection of personal data have emerged as a major issue for congressional consideration. Despite the rise in interest in data protection, the legislative paradigms governing cybersecurity and data privacy are complex and technical, and lack uniformity at the federal level. The constitutional \"right to privacy\" developed over the course of the 20th century, but this right generally guards only against government intrusions and does little to shield the average internet user from private actors. At the federal statutory level, there are a number of statutes that protect individuals' personal data or concern cybersecurity, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, and others. And a number of different agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), enforce these laws. But these statutes primarily regulate certain industries and subcategories of data. The FTC fills in some of the statutory gaps by enforcing a broad prohibition against unfair and deceptive data protection practices. But no single federal law comprehensively regulates the collection and use of consumers' personal data. Seeking a more fulsome data protection system, some governments—such as California and the European Union (EU)—have recently enacted privacy laws regulating nearly all forms of personal data within their jurisdictional reach. Some argue that Congress should consider creating similar protections in federal law, but others have criticized the EU and California approaches as being overly prescriptive and burdensome. Should the 116th Congress consider a comprehensive federal data protection law, its legislative proposals may involve numerous decision points and legal considerations. Points of consideration may include the conceptual framework of the law (i.e., whether it is prescriptive or outcome-based), the scope of the law and its definition of protected information, and the role of the FTC or other federal enforcement agency. Further, if Congress wants to allow individuals to enforce data protection laws and seek remedies for the violations of such laws in court, it must account for standing requirements in Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution. Federal preemption also raises complex legal questions—not only of whether to preempt state law, but what form of preemption Congress should employ. Finally, from a First Amendment perspective, Supreme Court jurisprudence suggests that while some privacy, cybersecurity, or data security regulations are permissible, any federal law that restricts protected speech, particularly if it targets specific speakers or content, may be subject to more stringent review by a reviewing court."], "all_classes": null, "length": 18048}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is about the reliability of the Census Bureau's life-cycle cost estimate for the 2020 Census. \n\nFirst, the report mentions that a reliable cost estimate is crucial for budgeting, planning, and managing the 2020 Census. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requires programs to maintain current and well-documented estimates of program costs, which must encompass the full life-cycle of the program. Without reliable estimates, agencies risk cost overruns, missed deadlines, and performance shortfalls. \n\nThe report outlines four characteristics that a reliable cost estimate must meet: comprehensive, well-documented, accurate, and credible. If any of these are not met, the estimate is not reliable. The report also discusses the Bureau's past issues with cost estimation, such as the 2010 Census cost estimate being unreliable due to lack of documentation and not meeting the best practices. \n\nIn 2015, the Bureau estimated the 2020 Census cost to be $12.3 billion. However, in 2017, the cost estimate was updated to $15.6 billion, which is a significant increase. The report explains that this increase is due to various factors, including changes in assumptions, improved risk management techniques, and increased IT costs. \n\nThe Bureau has made progress in improving the reliability of the cost estimate, but there are still areas that need attention. For example, the report found that the 2017 cost estimate only partially met the criteria for being well-documented. This is a problem because it makes it difficult to replicate calculations, detect errors, and ensure transparency in the estimation process. \n\nThe report also discusses the Bureau's efforts to improve the reliability of the cost estimate by implementing new guidance, policies, and procedures for developing cost estimates that meet best practices criteria. The Bureau has also established a work breakdown structure (WBS) that defines the work, products, activities, and resources necessary to accomplish the 2020 Census. \n\nThe report highlights that the Bureau's cost estimation process has improved over time, but there are still challenges in meeting the best practices for developing a high-quality estimate. The report also mentions that the Bureau has taken steps to address these challenges, such as establishing reliable guidance, processes, and policies for developing cost estimates that meet best practices criteria.", "answers": ["In October 2017, the Department of Commerce (Commerce) announced that the projected life-cycle cost of the 2020 Census had climbed to $15.6 billion, a more than $3 billion (27 percent) increase over its 2015 estimate. A high-quality, reliable cost estimate is a key tool for budgeting, planning, and managing the 2020 Census. Without this capability, the Bureau is at risk of experiencing program cost overruns, missed deadlines, and performance shortfalls. GAO was asked to evaluate the reliability of the Bureau's life-cycle cost estimate. This report evaluates the reliability of the Bureau's revised life-cycle cost estimate for the 2020 Census and the extent to which the Bureau is using it as a management tool, and compares the 2015 and 2017 cost estimates to describe key drivers of cost growth. GAO reviewed documentary and testimonial evidence from Bureau officials responsible for developing the 2020 Census cost estimate and used its cost assessment guide ( GAO-09-3SP ) as criteria. Since 2015, the Census Bureau (Bureau) has made significant progress in improving its ability to develop a reliable cost estimate. While improvements have been made, the Bureau's October 2017 cost estimate for the 2020 Census does not fully reflect all the characteristics of a reliable estimate. (See figure.) Specifically, for the characteristic of being well-documented, GAO found that some of the source data either did not support the information described in the cost estimate or was not in the files provided for two of its largest field operations. In GAO's assessment of the 2015 version of the 2020 Census cost estimate, GAO recommended that the Bureau take steps to ensure that each of the characteristics of a reliable cost estimate is met. The Bureau agreed and has taken steps, but has not fully implemented this recommendation. A reliable cost estimate serves as a tool for program development and oversight, helping management make informed decisions. During this review, GAO found the Bureau used the cost estimate to inform decision making. Factors that contributed to cost fluctuations between the 2015 and 2017 cost estimates include: Changes in assumptions. Among other changes, a decrease in the assumed rate for self-response from 63.5 percent in 2015 to 60.5 percent in 2017 increased the cost of collecting responses from nonresponding housing units. Improved ability to anticipate and quantify risk. In general, contingency allocations designed to address the effects of potential risks increased overall from $1.3 billion in 2015 to $2.6 billion in 2017. An overall increase in information technology (IT) costs. IT cost increases, totaling $1.59 billion, represented almost 50 percent of the total cost increase from 2015 to 2017. GAO is not making any new recommendations but maintains its earlier recommendation—that the Secretary of Commerce direct the Bureau to take specific steps to ensure its cost estimate meets the characteristics of a high-quality estimate. In its response to this report, Commerce generally agreed with the findings related to cost estimation improvements, but disagreed that the cost estimate was not reliable. However, until GAO's recommendation is fully implemented the cost estimate cannot be considered reliable."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6712}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report about congressional salaries. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points.\n\nThe report starts by mentioning the U.S. Constitution's Article I, Section 6, which states that Congress's compensation is determined by law and paid from the U.S. Treasury. Then there's the Twenty-Seventh Amendment, which prevents any law changing the compensation for Senators and Representatives from taking effect until an election of Representatives has intervened. This amendment was proposed in 1789 but wasn't ratified until 1992. \n\nThe report then discusses the history of congressional salaries since 1789, including the most recent pay adjustment in 2009, which set the salary at $174,000 for most members. Exceptions include the Speaker of the House and other leaders with higher salaries. \n\nThe report also explains the different methods used to adjust congressional salaries. Before 1968, specific legislation was used to adjust salaries. From 1968 onwards, the method involved recommendations from the President based on a quadrennial salary commission. However, the commission ceased to exist in 1989, and its authority was taken by the Citizens' Commission on Public Service and Compensation. \n\nAnother method is the annual adjustment, which was established in 1975 (P.L. 94-82) and was tied to the annual comparability increases provided to General Schedule (GS) federal employees. This procedure was changed by the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, which now uses a formula based on changes in private sector wages and salaries as measured by the Employment Cost Index (ECI). \n\nThe report includes historical tables on the rate of pay for Members of Congress since 1789, details on enacted legislation with language prohibiting the automatic annual pay adjustment since the most recent adjustment, the adjustments projected by the Ethics Reform Act as compared with actual adjustments in Member pay, and Member pay in constant and current dollars since 1992. \n\nThere are also references to other CRS reports that discuss various aspects of congressional pay and benefits, such as retirement benefits, health benefits, and allowances. \n\nThe report outlines three primary ways to adjust Member pay: specific legislation, recommendations from the President based on a salary commission, and annual adjustments tied to the Employment Cost Index. It also discusses the historical context of these adjustments, including the impact of legislation that", "answers": ["Congress is required by Article I, Section 6, of the Constitution to determine its own pay. In the past, Congress periodically enacted specific legislation to alter its pay; the last time this occurred affected pay in 1991. More recently, pay has been determined pursuant to laws establishing formulas for automatic adjustments. The Ethics Reform Act of 1989 established the current automatic annual adjustment formula, which is based on changes in private sector wages as measured by the Employment Cost Index (ECI). The adjustment is automatic unless denied statutorily, although the percentage may not exceed the percentage base pay increase for General Schedule (GS) employees. Member pay has since been frozen in two ways: (1) directly, through legislation that freezes salaries for Members but not for other federal employees, and (2) indirectly, through broader pay freeze legislation that covers Members and other specified categories of federal employees. Members of Congress last received a pay adjustment in January 2009. At that time, their salary was increased 2.8%, to $174,000. A provision in P.L. 111-8 prohibited any pay adjustment for 2010. Under the pay adjustment formula, Members were originally scheduled to receive an adjustment in January 2010 of 2.1%, although this would have been revised downward automatically to 1.5% to match the GS base pay adjustment. Members next were scheduled to receive a 0.9% pay adjustment in 2011. The pay adjustment was prohibited by P.L. 111-165. Additionally, P.L. 111-322 prevented any adjustment in GS base pay before December 31, 2012. Since the percentage adjustment in Member pay may not exceed the percentage adjustment in the base pay of GS employees, Member pay was also frozen during this period. If not limited by GS pay, Member pay could have been adjusted by 1.3% in 2012. The ECI formula established a maximum potential pay adjustment in January 2013 of 1.1%. P.L. 112-175 extended the freeze on GS pay rates for the duration of this continuing resolution, which also extended the Member freeze since the percentage adjustment in Member pay may not exceed the percentage adjustment in GS base pay. Subsequently, Member pay for 2013 was further frozen in P.L. 112-240. The maximum potential 2014 pay adjustment of 1.2%, or $2,100, was denied by P.L. 113-46. The maximum potential January 2015 Member pay adjustment was 1.6%, or $2,800. President Obama proposed a 1.0% increase in the base pay of GS employees, which would automatically have limited any Member pay adjustment to 1.0%. P.L. 113-235 contained a provision prohibiting any Member pay adjustment. The maximum potential January 2016 pay adjustment of 1.7%, or $3,000, would have been limited to 1.0%, or $1,700, due to the GS base pay increase. Member pay for 2016 was frozen by P.L. 114-113. The maximum potential January 2017 pay adjustment of 1.6%, or $2,800, would have been limited to 1.0%, or $1,700, due to the GS base pay increase. Member pay for 2017 was frozen by P.L. 114-254. The maximum potential January 2018 pay adjustment of 1.8%, or $3,100, was automatically limited to 1.4%, or $2,400, before being frozen by P.L. 115-141. The maximum potential January 2019 pay adjustment of 2.3%, or $4,000, was automatically limited to 1.4%, or $2,400, before being frozen at the 2009 level by P.L. 115-244. The maximum potential January 2020 pay adjustment is 2.6%, or $4,500. If Members of Congress had received every adjustment prescribed by the ECI formula since 1992, and the 2 U.S.C. §4501 limitation regarding the percentage base pay increase for GS employees remained unchanged, the 2019 salary would be $210,900. When adjusted for inflation, Member salaries have decreased 15% since the last pay adjustment in 2009. Both the automatic annual adjustments and funding for Members' salaries are provided pursuant to other laws (2 U.S.C. §4501)—not the annual appropriations bills—and a provision prohibiting a scheduled adjustment could be included in any bill, or introduced as a separate bill."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5069}
{"pred": " The Department of Defense (DOD) has established policies to address unwanted sexual behaviors, including sexual assault, sexual harassment, and domestic violence. Sexual assault is defined as intentional sexual contact, characterized by the use of force, threats, intimidation, or when the victim does not or cannot consent. This includes various specific offenses under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, such as rape, sexual assault, aggravated sexual contact, and forcible sodomy. Sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, which can affect an individual's work performance or create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment. However, a provision of the NDAA for FY 2017 changed the definition of sexual harassment for the military for purposes of investigations by commanding officers so that it is no longer defined solely as a form of sex discrimination, but is recognized as an adverse behavior on the spectrum of behavior that can contribute to an increase in the incidence of sexual assault. DOD has various offices and organizations that play a role in addressing unwanted sexual behaviors in the military, including the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, who oversees the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO), which serves as the department’s single point of authority, accountability, and oversight for its sexual assault prevention and response program. SAPRO is responsible for providing the military services with guidance and technical support and facilitating the identification and resolution of issues; developing programs, policies, and training standards for the prevention of, reporting of, and response to sexual assault; developing strategic program guidance and joint planning objectives; overseeing the department’s collection and maintenance of data on reported alleged sexual assaults involving servicemembers; establishing mechanisms to measure the effectiveness of the department’s sexual assault prevention and response program; and preparing the department’s mandated annual reports to Congress on sexual assaults involving servicemembers. The Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness is responsible for developing the overall policy and guidance for the department’s efforts to prevent and respond to instances of sexual assault, except for criminal investigative policy matters assigned to the DOD Inspector General and legal processes in the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness oversees the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO), which serves as the department’s single point of authority, accountability, and oversight for its sexual assault prevention and response program. The responsibilities of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness and SAPRO with regard to sexual assault prevention and response", "answers": ["Unwanted sexual behaviors in the military—including sexual harassment, sexual assault, and domestic violence involving sexual assault—undermine core values, unit cohesion, combat readiness, and public goodwill. Recent studies suggest that these behaviors are part of a “continuum of harm,” which DOD defines as a range of interconnected, inappropriate behaviors that are connected to the occurrence of sexual assault and that support an environment that tolerates these behaviors. Senate Report 114-255 included a provision for GAO to review efforts by DOD to prevent unwanted sexual behaviors in the military. GAO assessed the extent to which DOD has (1) policies on sexual harassment that include CDC principles and relevant legislative elements; (2) processes for maintaining and reporting consistent data on incidents of unwanted sexual behaviors; and (3) overarching efforts, including a prevention strategy, to address unwanted sexual behaviors across the continuum of harm. GAO reviewed DOD policies and pertinent databases, and interviewed agency officials. The Department of Defense's (DOD) policies on sexual harassment include some but not all of the Centers for Disease Control's (CDC) principles for preventing sexual violence and include most relevant legislative elements. GAO identified six principles from CDC's framework for preventing sexual violence, which CDC defines as including sexual harassment. GAO found that Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and military service policies generally include CDC's principles regarding prevention strategies, but none address risk and protective factors, which identify conditions or behaviors that might heighten or lower the risk of sexual harassment victimization or perpetration, respectively. Additionally, a statutory provision in fiscal year 2013 mandated that DOD, among other things, develop a comprehensive sexual harassment policy that includes prevention training, mechanisms for anonymous reporting, and mechanisms for resolving incidents of sexual harassment. OSD and service policies are generally consistent with those required elements except for the inclusion of anonymous reporting. DOD is developing a new department-wide policy that will address sexual harassment, but it is too early to determine how the policy will address these issues. Without policies that include CDC's principles and mechanisms for anonymous reporting, DOD may miss opportunities to address and potentially reduce incidents of unwanted sexual behaviors. Finally, a statutory change in fiscal year 2017 redefined sexual harassment for certain purposes so it is no longer defined solely as a form of sex discrimination but is recognized also as an adverse behavior on the spectrum of behavior that can contribute to an increase in the incidence of sexual assault. While officials indicated a need to update policies, they were unclear on the full implications, if any, of this change. DOD has processes for maintaining and reporting consistent data on incidents of unwanted sexual behaviors including sexual assault and incidents of domestic violence that involve sexual assault, but does not have similar processes for maintaining and reporting data on incidents of sexual harassment. Specifically, DOD uses centralized databases to maintain and report data on incidents of sexual assault and domestic violence that involve sexual assault, but relies on military service-specific databases for information on incidents of sexual harassment. DOD has not established standard data elements and definitions to guide the services in maintaining and reporting data on sexual harassment. Inconsistencies in data elements and definitions generally mean that one service may be maintaining data that is more or less detailed than, or that differs from, the data maintained by other services. Such inconsistencies may create difficulties in reporting department-wide sexual harassment data, since the individual service data must be adapted to fit reporting requirements. DOD has several overarching efforts to address unwanted sexual behaviors across the continuum of harm, including developing an overarching prevention strategy. However, it is unclear whether the strategy under development will contain key elements for long-term and results-oriented strategic planning such as long-term goals, strategies to achieve goals, and metrics to gauge progress. Without incorporating these elements into its overarching prevention strategy, DOD may not be in a position to effectively coordinate and integrate prevention activities and reduce instances of unwanted sexual behaviors. GAO recommends that DOD fully include in its new policy on sexual harassment CDC's principles for sexual violence prevention and mechanisms for anonymous reporting, develop standard data elements and definitions for reporting sexual harassment incidents, and incorporate in its overarching prevention strategy elements key for a long-term, results-oriented strategy.

As of June 2018, the component had approximately 7,100 employees, including 190 IT staff, with 166 located in Washington, D.C., and 24 in domestic field offices. The component's IT infrastructure is heavily dependent on its communications systems to perform daily duties. In fiscal year 2018, the Secret Service planned to spend about $104.8 million on IT, including $34.6 million for development and modernization of its IT infrastructure and $70.2 million for operations and maintenance of existing IT systems. The Secret Service has faced long-standing challenges in managing its IT infrastructure, including network and system vulnerabilities, outdated mainframe systems, and insufficient IT modernization efforts. The component has initiated the Information Integration and Technology Transformation (IITT) investment to modernize and enhance its IT infrastructure, communications systems, applications, and processes. As of June 2018, the component had planned to spend approximately $42.7 million on IITT, which represented about 40 percent of its total planned IT spending for the fiscal year. The planned life cycle cost estimate for IITT is at least $811 million. The Secret Service has taken steps to address these challenges, including hiring a full-time CIO in November 2015 and consolidating all IT staff and assets under this CIO in March 2017. The component has also implemented a policy that establishes an acquisition life cycle framework for its non-major IT programs, which is consistent with the framework established for major acquisition programs. The Secret Service has implemented 11 of the 14 selected component-level CIO responsibilities, including developing and maintaining an IT strategic plan, concurrence with systems engineering life cycle tailoring plans, and oversight of agile development approaches. The component has not fully implemented the remaining three responsibilities, which include ensuring that all IT contracts are reviewed, updating the enterprise governance policy to properly reflect the CIO's role in developing and reviewing the IT budget, and ensuring that agile projects measure product quality and post-deployment user satisfaction.

GAO was asked to review the Secret Service's oversight of its IT portfolio and workforce. This report discusses the extent to which the (1) CIO implemented selected IT oversight responsibilities, (2) Secret Service implemented leading IT workforce planning and management practices, and (3) Secret Service and DHS implemented selected performance monitoring practices for IITT. GAO assessed agency documentation against 14 selected component CIO responsibilities established in DHS policy; 15 selected leading workforce planning and management practices within 5 topic areas; and two selected leading industry project monitoring practices that, among other things, were, in GAO's professional judgment, of most significance to managing IITT. The U.S. Secret Service (Secret Service) Chief Information Officer (CIO) fully implemented 11 of 14 selected information technology (IT) oversight responsibilities, and partially implemented the remaining 3. The CIO partially implemented the responsibilities to establish a process that ensures the Secret Service reviews IT contracts; ensure that the component's IT policies align with the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) policies; and set incremental targets to monitor program progress. Additional efforts to fully implement these 3 responsibilities will further position the CIO to effectively manage the IT portfolio. Of the 15 selected practices within the 5 workforce planning and management areas, the Secret Service fully implemented 3 practices, partly implemented 8, and did not implement 4 (see table). Within the strategic planning area, the component partly implemented the practice to, among other things, develop IT competency needs. While the Secret Service had defined general core competencies for its workforce, the Office of the CIO (OCIO) did not identify all of the technical competencies needed to support its functions. As a result, the office was limited in its ability to address any IT competency gaps that may exist. Also, while work remains to improve morale across the component, the Secret Service substantially implemented the employee morale practices for its IT staff. Secret Service officials said the gaps in implementing the workforce practices were due to, among other things, their focus on reorganizing the IT workforce within OCIO. Until the Secret Service fully implements these practices for its IT workforce, it may be limited in its ability to ensure the timely and effective acquisition and maintenance of the component's IT infrastructure and services. Of the two selected IT project monitoring practices, DHS and the Secret Service fully implemented the first practice to monitor the performance of the Information Integration and Technology Transformation (IITT) investment. In addition, for the second practice—to monitor projects on incremental development metrics—the Secret Service fully implemented the practice on one of IITT's projects and partially implemented it on another. In particular, OCIO did not fully measure post-deployment user satisfaction with the system on one project. OCIO plans to conduct a user satisfaction survey of the system by September 2018, which should inform the office on whether the system is meeting users' needs.

{"pred": " The report examines the patterns of disciplinary actions in U.S. public schools, highlighting significant disparities in how students are treated based on race, sex, and disability status. Key findings include:\n\n1. **Implicit Bias in Discipline**: Studies indicate that implicit biases—unconscious associations or stereotypes about people—can lead to different disciplinary outcomes for students based on their race and sex. Teachers and staff often have discretion in deciding whether to discipline students and the form of discipline to impose, such as for disobedience, defiance, and classroom disruption. These decisions can result in certain groups of students being more harshly disciplined than others.\n\n2. **Disproportionate Discipline by Race and Sex**: The report highlights that Black students, boys, and students with disabilities are disproportionately disciplined in K-12 public schools. This pattern persists regardless of the type of disciplinary action, level of school poverty, or type of public school these students attend. For example, Black students represented 15.5 percent of all public school students and accounted for 39 percent of students suspended from school, an overrepresentation of about 23 percentage points. Differences in discipline were particularly large between Black and White students. Although there were approximately 17.4 million more White students than Black students attending K-12 public schools in 2013-14, nearly 176,000 more Black students than White students were suspended from school that school year.\n\n3. **Impact of School Poverty on Discipline**: The report finds that increases in the percentage of low-income students in a school are generally associated with significantly higher rates for each of the six disciplinary actions. For instance, as the percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch increased, the likelihood of receiving each of the six disciplinary actions also increased. This pattern was particularly acute for Black students in high-poverty schools, where they were overrepresented by nearly 25 percentage points in suspensions from school. Similar patterns emerged for boys and students with disabilities, although unlike Black students, boys and students with disabilities were particularly overrepresented among students suspended from low-poverty public schools (poverty less than 25 percent).\n\n4. **Effect of School Type on Discipline**: The report uses a regression model to examine the independent effect of attending different types of public schools on disciplinary outcomes. The model shows several significant associations between school type and the likelihood of receiving discipline. For example, attending an alternative school was associated with a significantly higher likelihood of being suspended out of school, compared to attending a", "answers": ["Research has shown that students who experience discipline that removes them from the classroom are more likely to repeat a grade, drop out of school, and become involved in the juvenile justice system.

Education and Justice are responsible for enforcing federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination in the administration of discipline in public schools. GAO was asked to review the use of discipline in schools. To provide insight into these issues, this report examines (1) patterns in disciplinary actions among public schools, (2) challenges selected school districts reported with student behavior and how they are approaching school discipline, and (3) actions Education and Justice have taken to identify and address disparities or discrimination in school discipline. GAO analyzed discipline data from nearly all public schools for school year 2013-14 from Education's Civil Rights Data Collection; interviewed federal and state officials, as well as officials from a total of 5 districts and 19 schools in California, Georgia, Massachusetts, North Dakota, and Texas. We selected these districts based on disparities in suspensions for Black students, boys, or students with disabilities, and diversity in size and location. We also reviewed federal laws and a non-generalizable sample of seven recently resolved federal school discipline investigations (selected in part based on the type of alleged discrimination). We incorporated technical comments from the agencies as appropriate. Black students, boys, and students with disabilities were disproportionately disciplined (e.g., suspensions and expulsions) in K-12 public schools, according to GAO's analysis of Department of Education (Education) national civil rights data for school year 2013-14, the most recent available. These disparities were widespread and persisted regardless of the type of disciplinary action, level of school poverty, or type of public school attended. For example, Black students accounted for 15.5 percent of all public school students, but represented about 39 percent of students suspended from school—an overrepresentation of about 23 percentage points (see figure). Officials GAO interviewed in all five school districts in the five states GAO visited reported various challenges with addressing student behavior, and said they were considering new approaches to school discipline. They described a range of issues, some complex—such as the effects of poverty and mental health issues. For example, officials in four school districts described a growing trend of behavioral challenges related to mental health and trauma. While there is no one-size-fits-all solution for the issues that influence student behavior, officials from all five school districts GAO visited were implementing alternatives to disciplinary actions that remove children from the classroom, such as initiatives that promote positive behavioral expectations for students. Education and the Department of Justice (Justice) documented several actions taken to identify and address school discipline issues.

{"pred": " (One page, 500 words)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is about federal land ownership in the U.S., specifically the 640 million acres owned by the federal government. It mentions that these lands are concentrated in 12 western states, including Alaska, where the federal government owns about half of the total land area. The report then talks about the four agencies that manage these lands: NPS, FWS, BLM, and FS. Each of these agencies has different authorities for acquiring and disposing of land, and the report details these authorities.\n\nThe key points are that no single law provides authority for these agencies to acquire or dispose of land. Instead, Congress has enacted various laws over more than a century. The report describes the primary authorities of the four agencies. The extent to which each agency has authority to acquire and dispose of land varies. For example, the BLM has relatively broad authority for both acquisitions and disposals, while the NPS has no general authority to acquire land to create new park units or to dispose of park lands. The FS and FWS have more limited authorities than the BLM but not as restrictive as the NPS. The FS's authority to acquire lands is mostly limited to lands within or contiguous to the boundaries of a national forest. The agency has various authorities to dispose of land, but they are relatively constrained and infrequently used. The FWS has various authorities to acquire lands but no general authority to dispose of its lands. The acquisition authorities differ as to the circumstances in which they apply, and the disposal authorities likewise differ as to their purposes. Thus, where a specific acquisition or disposal by an agency is contemplated, the particular authority at issue should be consulted. In general, the acquisition authorities are designed to allow federal agencies to acquire lands that could be viewed as benefitting from federal management. Among other circumstances, acquisition might be authorized to bring inholdings or lands adjacent to federal lands into federal ownership to improve or simplify management of federal lands. Acquisitions also might be authorized to conserve species, protect natural and cultural resources, and increase opportunities for recreation. The disposal authorities generally are designed to allow federal agencies to dispose of land that is no longer required for a federal purpose, might be inefficient to manage, or might be chiefly valuable for another purpose. For instance, disposal might be authorized to allow lands to be used for agriculture, community development, mineral extraction,", "answers": ["The federal government owns roughly 640 million acres, heavily concentrated in 12 western states. Four agencies—the National Park Service (NPS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the Department of the Interior, and the U.S. Forest Service (FS) in the Department of Agriculture—administer about 95% of those lands. The extent to which each of these four federal agencies have authority to acquire and dispose of land varies considerably. The BLM has relatively broad authority for both acquisitions and disposals under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA). The agency also has other authorities for disposing of land, including two laws that allow the agency to retain the proceeds for subsequent land acquisition, among other purposes, and a law that allows transfers to governmental units and other entities for public purposes. By contrast, the NPS has no general authority to acquire land to create new park units or to dispose of park lands. The FS authority to acquire lands is mostly limited to lands within or contiguous to the boundaries of a national forest. The agency has various authorities to dispose of land, but they are relatively constrained and infrequently used. The FWS has various authorities to acquire lands but no general authority to dispose of its lands. The agency frequently uses acquisition authority under the Migratory Bird Conservation Act of 1929 because of the availability of funding through the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund. The nature of the acquisition and disposal authorities of the four federal agencies also varies. In general, the acquisition authorities are designed to allow the four agencies to bring into federal ownership lands that many contend could benefit from federal management. Disposal authorities generally are designed to allow agencies to convey land that is no longer needed for a federal purpose or that might be chiefly valuable for another purpose. Some of the authorities specify particular circumstances where they can be used, such as the conveyance of FS land for educational purposes and the disposal of BLM land for recreation and public purposes. Congress often faces questions on the adequacy of existing acquisition and disposal authorities; the nature, extent, and location of their use; and the extent of federal land ownership overall. The current acquisition and disposal authorities form the backdrop for consideration of measures to establish, modify, or eliminate authorities, or to provide for the acquisition or disposal of particular lands. In some cases, Congress enacts bills to provide authority to acquire or dispose of particular parcels where no standing authority exists and, in other cases, to direct or facilitate land transactions. Congress also addresses acquisition and disposal policy in the context of debates on the role and goals of the federal government in owning and managing land generally, and it has considered broader measures to dispose of lands or to promote acquisition. Other issues for Congress pertain to the sources and levels of funds for land acquisition. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is the primary source of funding for land acquisition. Congress has considered diverse measures related to the LWCF, such as legislation to make LWCF funding permanent and bills to direct LWCF monies to additional, nonacquisition purposes. Additionally, the FWS has the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund, an account with mandatory spending authority supported by revenue from three sources.

Even though some rules are more complex and harder to interpret, the House tends to follow similar procedures under similar circumstances. The report also mentions that the House frequently waives, supplants, or supplements its standing rules with special, temporary procedures, which generally fall into a limited number of recognizable patterns. \n\nThe second reason is that the underlying premise of most House rules is that a majority of Members should ultimately be able to work their will on the floor. While House rules generally recognize the importance of permitting any minority—partisan or bipartisan—to present its views and sometimes propose its alternatives, the rules do not enable that minority to filibuster or use other parliamentary devices to prevent the majority from prevailing without undue delay. This principle provides an underlying coherence to the various specific procedures discussed in the report.\n\nThe report also discusses the constitutional provisions that affect the House's procedures, such as the requirement for quorums and roll-call votes. It mentions that the Constitution allows each house to determine its own \"Rules of Proceedings,\" which gives the House a lot of flexibility. This includes the ability to amend its rules unilaterally, to suspend or ignore its rules whenever it chooses, and to have the Speaker or whoever is presiding not enforce the rules at their own initiative. Instead, Members must protect their own rights by affirmatively making points of order whenever they believe the rules are about to be violated. \n\nThe report then goes into more detail about the specific procedures, such as the debate limitations and the procedures for waiving or suspending certain rules. It explains that the House has found it necessary to limit the opportunities for each Representative to participate in floor deliberations. Whenever a Member is recognized to speak on the floor, there is always a time limit on his or her right to debate. The rules of the House never permit a Representative to hold", "answers": ["The daily order of business on the floor of the House of Representatives is governed by standing rules that make certain matters and actions privileged for consideration. On a day-to-day basis, however, the House can also decide to grant individual bills privileged access to the floor, using one of several parliamentary mechanisms. The standing rules of the House include several different parliamentary mechanisms that the body may use to act on bills and resolutions. Which of these will be employed in a given instance usually depends on the extent to which Members want to debate and amend the legislation. In general, all of the procedures of the House permit a majority of Members to work their will without excessive delay. The House considers most legislation by motions to suspend the rules, with limited debate and no floor amendments, with the support of at least two-thirds of the Members voting. Occasionally, the House will choose to consider a measure on the floor by the unanimous consent of Members. The Rules Committee is instrumental in recommending procedures for considering major bills and may propose restrictions on the floor amendments that Members can offer or bar them altogether. Many major bills are first considered in Committee of the Whole before being passed by a simple majority vote of the House. The Committee of the Whole is governed by more flexible procedures than the basic rules of the House, under which a majority can vote to pass a bill after only one hour of debate and with no floor amendments. Although a quorum is supposed to be present on the floor when the House is conducting business, the House assumes a quorum is present unless a quorum call or electronically recorded vote demonstrates that it is not. However, the standing rules preclude quorum calls at most times other than when the House is voting. Questions are first decided by voice vote, although any Member may then demand a division vote. Before the final result of a voice or division vote is announced, Members can secure an electronically recorded vote instead if enough Members desire it or if a quorum is not present in the House. The constitutional requirements for making law mean that each chamber must pass the same measure with the identical text before transmitting it to the President for his consideration. When the second chamber of Congress amends a measure sent to it by the first chamber, the two chambers must resolve legislative differences to meet this requirement. This can be accomplished by shuttling the bill back and forth between the House and Senate, with each chamber proposing amendments to the position of the other, or by establishing a conference committee to try to negotiate a compromise version of the legislation."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6694}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is about the overtime provisions in the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) for executive, administrative, and professional employees (EAP exemptions). It's structured into three sections: an overview of the FLSA and EAP exemptions, a discussion on the applicability of the EAP exemptions, and information on the 2019 proposed rule and the 2016 final rule.\n\nFirst, the FLSA was enacted in 1938 and sets minimum wage and overtime pay requirements for most, but not all, employees. Section 7(a) says that unless an employee is exempt, they must be paid time and a half for hours over 40 in a workweek. The EAP exemption was added in 1938, allowing certain employees to be exempt from both minimum wage and overtime. The Secretary of Labor is authorized to define these terms through regulations. The rationale was that EAP employees' work was harder to standardize, and they had other forms of compensation.\n\nThe report then discusses the three criteria for exemption: salary basis, duties, and salary level. Each of these has specific requirements. For example, the salary basis means the employee is paid a fixed salary, not subject to reduction based on work quantity or quality. The salary level is the threshold, typically a weekly rate, which has been raised nine times since the FLSA's enactment.\n\nThe report also covers the applicability of the EAP exemptions to various entities, including nonprofits, institutions of higher education (IHEs), state and local governments, and the U.S. territories. It mentions that while there are no general exemptions for these entities, certain employees may still be covered by the FLSA depending on their work duties and whether they engage in interstate commerce.\n\nAdditionally, the report discusses the 2016 final rule, which was invalidated before it could take effect. The 2019 proposed rule is discussed, which would increase the salary level threshold for EAP exemptions. The main changes include raising the salary level from $455 per week to $679 per week, increasing the HCE salary level from $100,000 to $147,414, allowing up to 10% of the standard salary level to be comprised of nondiscretionary bonuses,", "answers": ["The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), enacted in 1938, is the main federal law that establishes general wage and hour standards for most, but not all, private and public sector employees. Among other protections, the FLSA establishes that covered nonexempt employees must be compensated at one-and-a-half times their regular rate of pay for each hour worked over 40 hours in a workweek. The FLSA also establishes certain exemptions from its general labor market standards. One of the major exemptions to the overtime provisions in the FLSA is for bona fide \"executive, administrative, and professional\" employees (the \"EAP\" or \"white collar\" exemptions). The FLSA grants authority to the Secretary of Labor to define and delimit the EAP exemption \"from time to time.\" To qualify for this exemption from the FLSA's overtime pay requirement, an employee must be salaried (the \"salary basis\" test); perform specified executive, administrative, or professional duties (the \"duties\" test); and earn above an established salary level threshold (the \"salary level\" test). In March 2019, the Secretary of Labor published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to make changes to the EAP exemptions. The 2019 proposed rule would become effective around January 2020. The major changes in the 2019 proposed rule include increasing the standard salary level threshold from the previous level of $455 per week to $679 per week and committing the Department of Labor (DOL) to updating the EAP exemptions every four years through the rulemaking process. The 2019 proposed rule does not change the duties and responsibilities that employees must perform to be exempt. Thus, the 2019 proposed rule would affect EAP employees at salary levels between $455 and $679 per week in 2020. DOL estimates that about 4.9 million workers would be affected in the first year, including about 1.3 million EAP employees who would become newly entitled to overtime pay and an additional 3.6 million workers who would have overtime protection clarified and thereby strengthened.

With the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA; P.L. 115-123, February 9, 2018), which raised discretionary spending limits set by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25), the Administration's FY2019 foreign affairs funding request was entirely within enduring (base) funds; no Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding was included the SFOPS request for the first time since FY2012. The FY2019 request would have represented a 23.3% decrease in SFOPS funding compared with FY2018 actual funding levels. The proposed State and related agency funding would have been 18.7% below FY2018 funding and the foreign operations funding would have been reduced by 25.2%. In the State and related programs budget, cuts were proposed for several accounts, including the diplomatic security accounts, contributions to international organizations, and contributions for international peacekeeping activities. In the foreign operations budget, cuts would have been applied across all accounts, with disproportionately large cuts proposed for humanitarian assistance, multilateral assistance, and funding for bilateral development programs focused on agriculture, education, and democracy promotion. Both the House and Senate appropriations committees approved FY2019 SFOPS bills that included funding at higher levels than the Administration requested and closer to FY2018 funding. H.R. 6385, approved by the House appropriations committee on June 20, 2018, would have funded SFOPS accounts at $54.177 billion. S. 3108, approved by the Senate appropriations committee on June 21, 2018, would have provided $54.602 billion for SFOPS accounts. FY2019 began with seven appropriations bills, including SFOPS, unfinished. Congress and the President approved continuing resolutions to fund the affected federal agencies through December 21, 2018 at the FY2018 level (P.L. 115-245, Division C and P.L. 115-298).

According to the report, the majority of Foreign Service employees (73 percent) work in positions at overseas posts, while some (27 percent) are assigned to positions in the United States. However, the number of both staffed and vacant overseas Foreign Service positions increased between 2008 and 2018. As of March 31, 2018, 13 percent of State’s overseas Foreign Service positions were vacant, a rate similar to the percentages of vacancies in 2012 and 2008. The vacancies in both generalist and specialist positions at overseas posts have adversely affected the Department’s ability to carry out its mission effectively and threaten the security and safety of its employees, their families, and post facilities. The report highlights that the number of vacancies in certain critical positions, such as information management and security officer positions, has remained high. These vacancies have increased workloads and adversely affected the morale of Foreign Service employees. According to staff at overseas posts, vacancies in specialist positions at the posts may create greater challenges than vacancies in generalist positions. The report also notes that vacancies in certain regions with high security risks, such as the South and Central Asian Affairs Bureau (SCA) and Near Eastern Affairs Bureau (NEA), have the highest percentages of vacancies. These vacancies have led to increased workloads and adverse effects on the Department’s ability to achieve its foreign policy goals. The report concludes that the Department of State needs to develop an integrated action plan to address persistent Foreign Service vacancies at overseas posts, including corrective measures to address the root causes of the vacancies, following what was called for in the 2017 High-Risk Series report. The Secretary of State should develop an integrated action plan that defines the root causes of persistent Foreign Service vacancies at overseas posts and provides suggested corrective measures to reduce such vacancies, including steps necessary to implement solutions.

In 2009 and 2012, GAO identified ongoing Foreign Service staffing gaps. GAO was asked to review State's Foreign Service staffing. This report examines (1) vacancies in State's Foreign Service staffing at overseas posts, (2) reported effects of Foreign Service vacancies on diplomatic readiness, and (3) State's efforts to address Foreign Service vacancies. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed State's Global Employment Management System data as of March 2018. The system includes information on Foreign Service and Civil Service positions, including the total number of authorized Foreign Service positions and whether each position is filled or vacant. GAO also reviewed its relevant prior reports and State workforce planning documents. In addition, GAO interviewed State staff at 10 overseas posts, selected on the basis of large numbers of Foreign Service vacancies and diversity in the types of Foreign Service positions that were vacant at these posts, among other factors. The Department of State's (State) data show persistent Foreign Service vacancies at overseas posts since 2008. According to the data, 13 percent of overseas Foreign Service positions were vacant as of March 2018. This percentage is similar to the percentages GAO reported for 2008 and 2012, when 14 percent of these positions were vacant. In addition, State's data show persistent vacancies at overseas posts in generalist positions that help formulate and implement U.S. foreign policy and in specialist positions that support and maintain the functioning of overseas posts. State's data also show persistent Foreign Service vacancies at overseas posts with State's highest foreign policy priorities and in regions with security risks that could threaten U.S. foreign policy interests. According to staff at overseas posts, Foreign Service vacancies adversely affect State's ability to carry out U.S. foreign policy. Staff at overseas posts told us that vacancies increase workloads, contributing to low morale and higher stress for Foreign Service staff and that vacancies in Political and Economic positions—20 percent and 16 percent, respectively—limit the reporting on political and economic issues that posts are able to provide to State headquarters. Notably, officials also stated that vacancies in specialist positions may heighten security risks at overseas posts and disrupt post operations. For instance, some overseas post staff said that vacancies in Information Management positions had increased the vulnerability of posts' computer networks to potential cybersecurity attacks and other malicious threats. State described various efforts—implemented by multiple offices in the department —to help address overseas Foreign Service vacancies, but these efforts are not guided by an integrated action plan to reduce persistent vacancies. An example of State's efforts is the “Hard-to-Fill” program, which allows Civil Service staff an opportunity to fill a Foreign Service vacancy on a single overseas tour. According to GAO's 2017 High-Risk Series report, an agency should design and implement an action plan—integrated across its relevant offices—that defines the root causes of all skills gaps and suggests corrective measures. However, State has not developed such an action plan for reducing persistent overseas Foreign Service vacancies. Without developing an integrated action plan, overseas Foreign Service vacancies may persist. As a result, State's ability to achieve U.S. foreign policy goals and help ensure secure and efficient operations could be adversely impacted.

Key points include the increase in domestic crude oil production, the relative stability of consumption, and the growing global nature of these markets. Projections indicate that U.S. crude oil production will continue to rise, leading to a reversal of a decades-long decline in net imports. The SPR is primarily composed of crude oil, which is stored in underground salt caverns along the Gulf Coast in Louisiana and Texas. The SPR is managed by the Department of Energy's Office of Petroleum Reserves and maintained by Fluor Federal Petroleum Operations LLC. The SPR currently maintains four storage sites—Bayou Choctaw, Big Hill, Bryan Mound, and West Hackberry—with a design capacity of 713.5 million barrels. The SPR is used to meet the U.S. International Energy Program (IEA) obligations, including the 90-day reserve requirement. However, the SPR is not the only reserve; private reserves are also used. The SPR is configured primarily to respond to global oil supply disruptions, but it has been used primarily in response to domestic disruptions. The SPR is limited in this role because it is almost entirely composed of crude oil, not refined petroleum products, which may not be effective in responding to disruptions that affect the refining sector.

DOE manages the SPR. As a member of the International Energy Agency, the United States is obligated to maintain reserves equivalent to at least 90 days of the previous year's net imports (imports minus exports). The SPR's storage and related infrastructure is aging, and DOE has plans to modernize these facilities. Since 2015, Congress has mandated crude oil sales. As of March 2018, the SPR held about 665 million barrels of crude oil. GAO was asked to examine the SPR's ability to meet U.S. energy security needs. This report examines, among other things, the extent to which (1) DOE has identified the optimal size of the SPR, and (2) DOE's plans for modernizing the SPR take into account the effects of congressionally mandated crude oil sales. GAO reviewed DOE's plans and studies, and interviewed agency officials and nine experts selected based on prior work, referrals, and a literature review. The Department of Energy (DOE) has not identified the optimal size of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). In 2016, DOE completed a long-term strategic review of the SPR after its last comprehensive examination conducted in 2005. The 2016 review examined the benefits of several SPR sizes, but it did not identify an optimal size and its review was limited in several ways. In particular, DOE did not fully consider recent and expected future changes in market conditions, such as the implications of falling net imports, or the role that increased levels of private reserves (reserves held by private companies for their own purposes) may play in responding to supply disruptions. These changes have contributed to SPR and private reserves reaching historically high levels on a net imports basis (see figure). These changes are expected to continue to evolve—according to government projections, the United States will become a net exporter in the late 2020s before again becoming a net importer between 2040 and 2050. GAO has found that agencies should reexamine their programs if conditions change. Without addressing the limitations of its 2016 review and periodically performing reexaminations in the future, DOE cannot be assured that the SPR will be sized appropriately into the future. DOE has taken steps to take into account congressionally mandated sales of SPR crude oil in its $1.4 billion modernization plans for SPR's infrastructure and facilities. The SPR is projected to hold 405 million barrels of oil by the end of fiscal year 2027. However, DOE's current plans are based on information analyzed prior to recently mandated sales. According to DOE officials, the agency began a study in March 2018 to assess the effects of these sales on the SPR's modernization. However, this study is not examining all options for handling any excess SPR assets that may be created by currently mandated sales or any additional sales that may be mandated in the future, inconsistent with an agency order on real property asset management that calls for identifying excess assets. For example, DOE does not plan to examine the potential to lease unused SPR storage capacity to the private sector because DOE is not currently authorized to enter into such leases, according to agency officials. If authorized, leasing capacity could generate revenues that could help offset the costs of modernization. By not examining a full range of options, DOE risks missing beneficial ways to modernize the SPR while saving taxpayer resources. GAO is making four recommendations, including that DOE (1) supplement the 2016 review by conducting an additional analysis, (2) ensure that the agency periodically reexamines the size of the SPR, and (3) consider a full range of options for handling potentially excess assets as it conducts its study, among other things.

The old program allowed medical centers to order supplies with a lot of flexibility, but it prevented standardization, which is important for cost savings and clinical consistency. The VA decided to transition to MSPV-NG to address these issues. \n\nThe transition involved multiple stakeholders, including the VHA Procurement and Logistics Office, VA's Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC), and logistics and clinical personnel at each medical center.

After April 2017, the legacy program was no longer available. The new program restricts ordering to a narrow formulary. \n\nHowever, the transition faced several challenges. The VA didn't have a documented program strategy, leadership instability, and workforce capacity issues.

These networks reported they analyze their spending to identify frequently purchased items and prioritize those for standardization to achieve cost savings. They also involve clinicians early and frequently to ensure buy-in and clinical review. \n\nThe VA's implementation of MSPV-NG was not in line with leading practices. They lacked a documented strategy, leadership stability, and workforce capacity. The initial requirements development process and tight time frames led to ineffective contracting. \n\nThe program's formulary didn't meet the needs of the medical centers, and they haven't achieved utilization and cost avoidance goals.", "answers": ["VA spends hundreds of millions of dollars annually on medical supplies to meet the health care needs of about 7 million veterans.

VA began developing requirements in early 2015 and launched the program in December 2016. This testimony summarizes key information contained in GAO's November 2017 report, GAO-18-34 . Specifically, it addresses the extent to which VA's implementation of MSPV-NG has been effective in meeting program goals. GAO analyzed VA's requirements development and contracting processes, and identified key supply chain practices cited by four leading hospital networks. GAO also met with contracting and clinical officials at six medical centers, selected based on high dollar contract obligations in fiscal years 2014-2016 and geographic representation. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) established the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor-Next Generation (MSPV-NG) program to provide an efficient, cost-effective way for its facilities to order supplies, but its initial implementation did not have an overarching strategy, stable leadership, and workforce capacity that could have facilitated medical center buy-in for the change. VA also developed requirements for a broad range of MSPV-NG items with limited clinical input. Further, starting in June 2015, VA planned to award competitive contracts, but instead, 79 percent of the items available for purchase under MSPV-NG were added through non-competitive agreements.

{"pred": " The report outlines the history and current practices of naming U.S. Navy ships. Traditionally, the Secretary of the Navy has been responsible for naming ships, a role that was explicitly assigned by law in the 19th century. However, the reference to the Secretary of the Navy in the U.S. Code disappeared in 1925, leaving the issue of ship naming authority ambiguous. Despite this, the Secretary of the Navy is believed to retain implicit authority, given the location of Section 8662 in subtitle C of Title 10, which covers the Navy and Marine Corps. The process of naming ships is as much, if not more, a product of evolution and tradition than of legislation. The Secretary of the Navy can rely on many sources to help reach decisions, including the Naval History and Heritage Command, which compiles primary and alternate ship name recommendations and forwards them to the Chief of Naval Operations by way of the chain of command. These recommendations are the result of research into the Navy's history and by suggestions submitted by service members, Navy veterans, and the public. Ship name source records at NHHC reflect the wide variety of name sources that have been used in the past, particularly since World War I. Ship name recommendations are conditioned by such factors as the name categories for ship types now being built, as approved by the Secretary of the Navy; the distribution of geographic names of ships of the fleet; names borne by previous ships that distinguished themselves in service; names recommended by individuals and groups; and names of naval leaders, national figures, and deceased members of the Navy and Marine Corps who have been honored for heroism in war or for extraordinary achievement in peace. The final selection of a ship's name is the Secretary's to make, informed and guided by his own thoughts, counsel, and preferences. While there is no set time for assigning a name, it is customarily done before the ship is christened. The ship's sponsor— the person who will christen the ship— is also selected and invited by the Secretary. In the case of ships named for individuals, an effort is made to identify the eldest living direct female descendant of that individual to perform the role of ship's sponsor. For ships with other name sources, it is customary to honor the wives of senior naval officers or public officials. The July 2012 Navy report to Congress states that \"US Navy ship-naming policies, practices, and 'traditions' are not fixed; they evolve constantly over time.\" The report also states that", "answers": ["Names for Navy ships traditionally have been chosen and announced by the Secretary of the Navy, under the direction of the President and in accordance with rules prescribed by Congress.

Some observers have perceived a breakdown in, or corruption of, the rules for naming Navy ships. On July 13, 2012, the Navy submitted to Congress a 73-page report on the Navy's policies and practices for naming ships. For ship types now being procured for the Navy, or recently procured for the Navy, naming rules can be summarized as follows: The first Ohio replacement ballistic missile submarine (SSBN-826) has been named Columbia in honor of the District of Columbia, but the Navy has not stated what the naming rule for these ships will be. Virginia (SSN-774) class attack submarines are being named for states. Aircraft carriers are generally named for past U.S. Presidents. Of the past 14, 10 were named for past U.S. Presidents, and 2 for Members of Congress. Destroyers are being named for deceased members of the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, including Secretaries of the Navy. The Navy has not yet announced a naming rule for its planned new class of FFG(X) frigates, the first of which the Navy wants to procure in FY2021. Previous classes of U.S. Navy frigates, like Navy destroyers, were generally named for naval leaders and heroes. Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) are being named for regionally important U.S. cities and communities. Amphibious assault ships are being named for important battles in which U.S. Marines played a prominent part, and for famous earlier U.S. Navy ships that were not named for battles. San Antonio (LPD-17) class amphibious ships are being named for major U.S. cities and communities, and cities and communities attacked on September 11, 2001. John Lewis (TAO-205) class oilers are being named for people who fought for civil rights and human rights. Expeditionary Fast Transports (EPFs) are being named for small U.S. cities. Expeditionary Transport Docks (ESDs) and Expeditionary Sea Bases (ESBs) are being named for famous names or places of historical significance to U.S. Marines. Navajo (TATS-6) class towing, salvage, and rescue ships are being named for prominent Native Americans or Native American tribes. Since 1974, at least 21 U.S. military ships have been named for persons who were living at the time the name was announced. The most recent instance occurred on May 6, 2019, when the Navy announced that it was naming the destroyer DDG-51 for former Senator Sam Nunn. Members of the public are sometimes interested in having Navy ships named for their own states or cities, for older U.S. Navy ships (particularly those on which they or their relatives served), for battles in which they or their relatives participated, or for people they admire. Congress has long maintained an interest in how Navy ships are named, and has influenced the naming of certain Navy ships. The Navy suggests that congressional offices wishing to express support for proposals to name a Navy ship for a specific person, place, or thing contact the office of the Secretary of the Navy to make their support known. Congress may also pass legislation relating to ship names. Measures passed by Congress in recent years regarding Navy ship names have all been sense-of-the-Congress provisions."], "all_classes": null, "length": 9736}
{"pred": " The U.S. Fourth National Climate Assessment, released in 2018, highlights that climate change is already affecting the United States and is expected to intensify in the future. The severity of these impacts will largely depend on actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and to adapt to the changes that will occur. While various efforts to reduce GHG emissions are currently underway on the international and sub-national level, federal policymakers and stakeholders have differing viewpoints on what to do, if anything, about future climate change and related impacts. Some argue that climate change poses a \"direct, existential threat\" to human society and that nations must start making significant reductions in GHG emissions to avoid \"dire effects.\" Others question whether there are sufficient risks of climate change to merit a federal program requiring GHG emission reductions. Some argue that a unilateral approach to climate change by the United States could disproportionately impact domestic industries while achieving minimal results in global climate change mitigation. The report does not compare and analyze the multiple policy tools available to Congress that could address climate change. Instead, it focuses on the policy considerations and potential impacts of using a carbon tax or GHG emissions fee to control GHG emissions. The key human-related GHG is CO2, which is generated primarily through the combustion of fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas. In 2016, fossil fuel combustion accounted for 94% of U.S. CO2 emissions and 76% of U.S. GHG emissions. A carbon tax could apply either directly to GHG emissions or to the materials—based on their carbon contents—that ultimately generate the emissions (i.e., \"emissions inputs\"). A carbon price on emissions or their emissions inputs—mainly fossil fuels—would increase the relative price of the more carbon-intensive energy sources, particularly coal. This result could spur innovation in less carbon-intensive technologies (e.g., renewable energy, nuclear power, carbon capture and sequestration [CCS]) and stimulate other behavior that may decrease emissions, such as efficiency improvements. The energy price increases could also have both economy-wide impacts and negative effects on specific industries and particular demographic groups. A carbon tax approach has received some attention and debate in recent years. In the 115th Congress, Members introduced nine carbon tax or fee proposals. Outside of Congress, the Climate Leadership Council—a bipartisan group of former policymakers and industry leaders—published a conceptual carbon tax approach in 2017 that generated some interest. Some of the industry leaders on the council represent", "answers": ["The U.S. Fourth National Climate Assessment, released in 2018, concluded that \"the impacts of global climate change are already being felt in the United States and are projected to intensify in the future—but the severity of future impacts will depend largely on actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas [GHG] emissions and to adapt to the changes that will occur.\" Members of Congress and stakeholders articulate a wide range of perspectives over what to do, if anything, about GHG emissions, future climate change, and related impacts. If Congress were to consider establishing a program to reduce GHG emissions, one option would be to attach a price to GHG emissions with a carbon tax or GHG emissions fee. In the 115th Congress, Members introduced nine bills to establish a carbon tax or emissions fee program. However, many Members have expressed their opposition to such an approach. In particular, in the 115th Congress, the House passed a resolution \"expressing the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the United States economy.\" Multiple economic studies have estimated the emission reductions that particular carbon tax would achieve. For example, a 2018 study analyzed various impacts of four carbon tax rate scenarios: a $25/metric ton of CO2 and $50/metric ton of CO2 carbon tax, increasing annually by 1% and 5%. The study concluded that each of the scenarios would likely achieve the U.S. GHG emission reduction target pledged under the international Paris Agreement (at least in terms of CO2 emissions). A carbon tax system would generate a new revenue stream, the magnitude of which would depend on the scope and rate of the tax, among other factors. In 2018, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that a $25/metric ton carbon tax would yield approximately $100 billion in its first year. CBO projected that federal revenue would total $3.5 trillion in FY2019. Policymakers would face challenging decisions regarding the distribution of the new carbon tax revenues. Congress could apply revenues to support a range of policy objectives but would encounter trade-offs among the objectives. The central trade-offs involve minimizing economy-wide costs, lessening the costs borne by specific groups—particularly low-income households and displaced workers in certain industries (e.g., coal mining)—and supporting other policy objectives. A primary argument against a carbon tax regards it potential economy-wide impacts, often measured as impacts to the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). Some may argue that projected impacts should be compared with the climate benefits achieved from the program as well as the estimated costs of taking no action. The potential impacts would depend on a number of factors, including the program's magnitude and design and, most importantly, the use of carbon tax revenues. In general, economic literature finds that some of the revenue applications would reduce the economy-wide costs from a carbon tax but may not eliminate them entirely. In addition, some studies cite particular economic modeling scenarios in which certain carbon tax revenue applications produce a net increase in GDP compared to a baseline scenario. These scenarios involve using carbon tax revenues to offset reductions in other tax rates (e.g., corporate income or payroll taxes). Although economic models generally indicate that these particular revenue applications would yield the greatest benefit to the economy overall, the models also find that lower-income households would likely face a disproportionate impact under such an approach. As lower-income households spend a greater proportion of their income on energy needs (electricity, gasoline), these households are expected to experience disproportionate impacts from a carbon tax if revenues were not recycled back to them in some fashion (e.g., lump-sum distribution). A price on GHG emissions could create a competitive disadvantage for some industries, particularly \"emission-intensive, trade-exposed industries.\" Policymakers have several options to address this concern, including establishing a \"border carbon adjustment\" program, which would levy a fee on imports from countries without comparable GHG reduction programs. Alternatively, policymakers could allocate (indefinitely or for a period of time) some of the carbon tax revenues to selected industry sectors or businesses. Relatedly, a carbon tax system is projected to disproportionately impact fossil fuel industries, particularly coal, and the communities that rely on their employment. To alleviate these impacts, policymakers may consider using some of the revenue to provide transition assistance to employees or affected communities."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8507}
{"pred": " The report discusses the financial challenges facing the Postal Service's Retiree Health Benefits (RHB) Fund, which is part of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). The RHB Fund is projected to be depleted in 12 years under the current status quo, with USPS having missed approximately $38 billion in payments since fiscal year 2010. The 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) required USPS to start fully prefunding retiree health benefits, which involved making annual payments to a newly established fund to build up funds to cover future postal retiree health benefit costs. The RHB Fund is on an unsustainable path, and the report highlights the need for congressional action to address the financial shortfall. The report outlines eight potential policy approaches to address the financial sustainability of postal retiree health benefits, including shifting costs to the federal government, reducing benefits or increasing costs to retirees and/or postal employees, and changing how the benefits are financed. The report also discusses the financial trends of companies and state governments, noting that many have eliminated or reduced retiree health benefits due to financial challenges, rising health care costs, and the legal ability to change such programs. The report concludes that without intervention, the RHB Fund will be depleted, and USPS may be unable to cover its share of retiree health benefits, which could affect postal retirees, USPS, postal customers, and other stakeholders, including the federal government. The report suggests that Congress should consider passing legislation to put postal retiree health benefits on a more sustainable financial footing. The report also presents a high-level overview of eight potential policy approaches, which are not mutually exclusive and are not an exhaustive list of possible options. Each approach could include a range of specific options, thus, even if successfully implemented, no one approach would necessarily be sufficient to make postal retiree health benefits financially sustainable. The report concludes that as long as USPS is required by law to pay its share of retiree health benefits premiums, it is important for USPS to prefund its retiree health benefit liability to the maximum extent that its finances permit. The report emphasizes that multiple options exist to prefund benefits and amortize unfunded liability, and that no prefunding approach will be viable unless USPS can make the payments and maintain liquidity. The report also discusses the potential consequences of the RHB Fund being depleted, including the risk of postal retirees losing their health benefits, the impact on USPS, and the potential financial burden on the federal government. The report concludes that without congressional action, the", "answers": ["USPS is required to prefund its share of health benefits costs for its retirees. To do so, USPS is required to make payments into the RHB Fund, which is administered by OPM. However, USPS has not made any payments to the fund since fiscal year 2010. At the end of fiscal year 2017, USPS had missed $38.2 billion in payments, leaving the fund 44 percent funded. Pursuant to law, beginning in fiscal year 2017, OPM started drawing from the fund to cover USPS's share of postal retirees' health benefits premiums. GAO was asked to review issues related to the sustainability of the RHB Fund. This report examines (1) the financial outlook for the RHB Fund and (2) policy approaches for postal retiree health benefits, among other topics. GAO evaluated financial projections for the RHB Fund from OPM. GAO reviewed laws and regulations and identified policy approaches primarily by identifying legislative proposals, and literature on actions of companies and state governments to address retiree health benefits. These approaches are not exhaustive or mutually exclusive. GAO also interviewed experts in retiree health benefits and postal stakeholders, chosen on the basis of relevant publications and prior GAO work, and interviewed and obtained written responses from OPM and USPS officials. The financial outlook of the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund (RHB Fund) is poor. At the end of fiscal year 2017, the fund's assets declined to $49.8 billion and unfunded liabilities rose to $62.2 billion. Based on Office of Personnel Management (OPM) projections requested by GAO, the fund is on track to be depleted in fiscal year 2030 if the United States Postal Service (USPS) continues to make no payments into the fund. Annual payments of $1 billion or $2 billion into the fund would extend the projected depletion date by 2 to 5 years (see figure). USPS has said that its required payments to the fund are unaffordable relative to its current financial situation and outlook. For the past 11 years USPS has incurred large operating losses that it expects will continue. Additionally, USPS has stated that its opportunities for revenue generation and cost-cutting are limited. USPS reported that it did not make required fund payments in 2017 in order to preserve liquidity and cover operational costs. If the fund becomes depleted, USPS would be required by law to make the payments necessary to cover its share of health benefits premiums for current postal retirees. Current law does not address what would happen if the fund becomes depleted and USPS does not make payments to cover those premiums. Depletion of the fund could affect postal retirees as well as USPS, customers, and other stakeholders, including the federal government. About 500,000 postal retirees receive health benefits and OPM expects that number to remain about the same through 2035. GAO identified three categories of policy approaches for postal retiree health benefits, based on legislative proposals and pertinent literature. First, some approaches, such as generally requiring eligible postal retirees to participate in Medicare, would shift costs to the federal government. Second, some approaches would reduce benefits or increase costs to postal retirees and/or employees. Third, some approaches would change how benefits are financed (see table). All of these approaches have different potential effects and would require congressional action. Thus, it is up to Congress to consider the merits of different approaches and determine the most appropriate action to take. It would be preferable to take action when careful consideration is possible, rather than wait until lack of adequate funding could disrupt postal retiree health benefits. Congress should consider passing legislation to put postal retiree health benefits on a more sustainable financial footing.

{"pred": " The report discusses neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), a condition that affects infants born to mothers who used opioids during pregnancy. It outlines the various forms of prenatal opioid use, including prescription medications, medication-assisted treatment, prescription drug misuse, and illicit opioid use. The report highlights that medication-assisted treatment is considered the standard of care for pregnant women with opioid use disorders, as it prevents complications associated with illicit opioid use, encourages prenatal care, and reduces the risk of obstetric complications. The report also highlights the importance of non-pharmacologic treatment, such as rooming-in with the mother, swaddling, and breastfeeding, which can help reduce the severity of NAS symptoms and the length of the infant's hospital stay. The report also discusses the use of pharmacologic treatment, such as methadone or morphine, which may be necessary for the relief of moderate to severe signs of NAS. It notes that the use of multiple substances by pregnant women, known as maternal polysubstance use, can exacerbate NAS symptoms and prolong the infant's hospital stay. The report highlights the lack of a national standard of care for screening and treating NAS, with various scoring tools used to assess the infant's condition.

The report concludes that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has not developed a comprehensive plan to implement the recommendations from the Protecting Our Infants Act: Final Strategy. This lack of planning raises concerns about the HHS's ability to effectively address NAS in a timely manner and assess the effectiveness of its efforts. The report recommends that the Secretary of HHS should expeditiously develop a plan that includes priorities, timeframes, clear roles and responsibilities, and", "answers": ["As the opioid crisis has increased in recent years, so has the number of pregnant women who use opioids, which can result in NAS. A recent peer-reviewed study found that cases of NAS have grown nearly five-fold between 2000 and 2012 and that most infants with NAS are covered under Medicaid. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 includes a provision for GAO to examine NAS in the United States and related treatment services covered under Medicaid. This report 1) describes the hospital and non-hospital settings for treating infants with NAS and how Medicaid pays for services, 2) describes recommended practices and challenges for addressing NAS, and 3) examines HHS's strategy for addressing NAS. GAO reviewed HHS documentation and interviewed HHS officials. GAO also conducted site visits to four states—Kentucky, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin—selected based on several factors, including incidence rates of NAS and geographic variation. GAO interviewed stakeholders from 32 organizations, including health care providers and state officials in the selected states. The prenatal use of opioids or other drugs can produce a withdrawal condition in newborns known as neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Health care providers, state officials, and other stakeholders told GAO that most infants with NAS are treated in the hospital—such as in a neonatal intensive care unit—though some may be referred to a non-hospital setting—such as a neonatal withdrawal center with nursery rooms—to complete their treatment. The table below provides more information on settings for treating infants with NAS and on how Medicaid pays for services in these settings. According to stakeholders GAO interviewed and literature reviewed, there are several recommended practices and challenges associated with addressing NAS. The most frequently recommended practices included prioritizing non-pharmacologic treatment to infants—treatment that does not involve medications—such as allowing the mother to reside with the infant during treatment; educating mothers and health care providers on treatment of NAS, among other things; and using a protocol in the hospital or non-hospital setting for screening and treating infants with NAS. The most frequently cited challenges included the maternal use of multiple drugs—or polysubstance use—as it can exacerbate NAS symptoms; stigma faced by pregnant women who use opioids; hospital staff burden and limited physical capacity to care for infants with NAS; limited coordination of care for mothers and infants with NAS; and gaps in research and data on NAS, such as research on the long-term effects of the condition. In May 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a strategy document that makes key recommendations to address NAS. The Strategy recommends, for example, that health care providers receive continuing education on managing and treating infants with NAS and promote non-pharmacologic treatment. According to HHS officials, these recommendations will inform planning and policy across the department. However, HHS has yet to determine how and when the recommendations will be implemented, including establishing priorities; the roles and responsibilities of other federal, state, and public stakeholders; implementation timeframes; and methods for assessing progress. HHS officials told GAO that they expect to develop an implementation plan sometime in 2017 but had no timeline for doing so. Without a plan that clearly specifies how HHS will implement the Strategy and assess its progress, the department increases the risk that its recommendations for addressing NAS will not be implemented.

This disclosure followed other recent incidents involving the misuse of consumers' personal information from the Internet, which is used by about three-quarters of Americans. GAO was asked to review federal oversight of Internet privacy. This report addresses, among other objectives: (1) how FTC and FCC have overseen consumers' Internet privacy and (2) selected stakeholders' views on the strengths and limitations of how Internet privacy currently is overseen and how, if it all, this approach could be enhanced. GAO evaluated FTC and FCC Internet privacy enforcement actions and authorities and interviewed representatives from industry, consumer advocacy groups, and academia; FTC and FCC staff; former FTC and FCC commissioners; and officials from other federal oversight agencies. Industry stakeholders were selected to represent different sectors, and academics were selected because of their expertise in privacy, consumer protection, and regulatory issues. The United States does not have a comprehensive Internet privacy law governing the collection, use, and sale or other disclosure of consumers' personal information. At the federal level, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) currently has the lead in overseeing Internet privacy, using its statutory authority under the FTC Act to protect consumers from unfair and deceptive trade practices. However, to date FTC has not issued regulations for Internet privacy other than those protecting financial privacy and the Internet privacy of children, which were required by law. For FTC Act violations, FTC may promulgate regulations but is required to use procedures that differ from traditional notice-and-comment processes and that FTC staff said add time and complexity. In the last decade, FTC has filed 101 enforcement actions regarding Internet privacy; nearly all actions resulted in settlement agreements requiring action by the companies. In most of these cases, FTC did not levy civil penalties because it lacked such authority for those particular violations. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has had a limited role in overseeing Internet privacy. From 2015 to 2017, FCC asserted jurisdiction over the privacy practices of Internet service providers. In 2016, FCC promulgated privacy rules for Internet service providers that Congress later repealed. FTC resumed privacy oversight of Internet service providers in June 2018. Stakeholders GAO interviewed had varied views on the current Internet privacy enforcement approach and how it could be enhanced. Most Internet industry stakeholders said they favored FTC's current approach—direct enforcement of its unfair and deceptive practices statutory authority, rather than promulgating and enforcing regulations implementing that authority. These stakeholders said that the current approach allows for flexibility and that regulations could hinder innovation. Other stakeholders, including consumer advocates and most former FTC and FCC commissioners GAO interviewed, favored having FTC issue and enforce regulations. Some stakeholders said a new data-protection agency was needed to oversee consumer privacy. Stakeholders identified three main areas in which Internet privacy oversight could be enhanced: Statute . Some stakeholders told GAO that an overarching Internet privacy statute could enhance consumer protection by clearly articulating to consumers, industry, and agencies what behaviors are prohibited. Rulemaking . Some stakeholders said that regulations can provide clarity, enforcement fairness, and flexibility. Officials from two other consumer protection agencies said their rulemaking authority assists in their oversight efforts and works together with enforcement actions. Civil penalty authority. Some stakeholders said FTC's Internet privacy enforcement could be more effective with authority to levy civil penalties for first-time violations of the FTC Act. Comprehensive Internet privacy legislation that establishes specific standards and includes traditional notice-and-comment rulemaking and broader civil penalty authority could enhance the federal government's ability to protect consumer privacy.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. \n\nThe report is from November 2011, discussing the FBI and GSA's assessments of the Hoover Building and other headquarters facilities. They found that the current facilities don't meet the FBI's long-term security, space, and building condition needs. Since the report, the assessment hasn't changed much. \n\nSecurity concerns include the FBI having outgrown the Hoover Building, leading to operations in annexes, some in multitenant buildings. This setup created security challenges, especially for annexes with non-federal tenants. Also, the FBI leases space from foreign owners in at least six locations, including Washington, D.C. This could pose security risks like espionage and unauthorized access.\n\nSpace issues: The Hoover Building has about 2.4 million square feet, but much of it is unusable. The remaining space isn't designed for current FBI needs. The building's original design is inefficient, making it hard to reconfigure for collaboration. For example, the GSA's 2017 prospectus said the Hoover Building couldn't be redeveloped to meet the FBI's needs. This led to operational and logistical challenges, like separating analysts and specialists, which hindered collaboration and classified work.\n\nBuilding condition: The Hoover Building's condition was deteriorating, with significant recapitalization needs. GSA limited investments to those necessary for health and safety and keeping systems functioning while assessing FBI's facility needs. This decision increased the potential for system failures and disruption to FBI operations. The report recommended that GSA evaluate its strategy to minimize major repair and recapitalization investments and take action to address any facility condition issues that could put FBI operations at risk and lead to further deterioration of the building.\n\nIn 2014, GSA evaluated its strategy for the Hoover Building and decided to complete some repairs to ensure safety and maintain tenancy. For example, they funded contracts to waterproof the mezzanine level and repair the concrete facade. However, the FBI still faces challenges in finding a new headquarters due to funding issues. \n\nThe report also discusses GSA's use of swap exchanges to address federal property needs. However, GSA has limited success with these exchanges, facing obstacles like market interest and unclear construction needs. The report recommends improving the process, including better communication and risk management.\n\nAdditionally, the report mentions alternative funding mechanisms for real property projects, such as retained fees or", "answers": ["GSA, which manages federal real property on behalf of other federal agencies, faces challenges in funding new construction projects due to budget constraints—including obtaining upfront funding—among other reasons. One type of transaction, called a swap exchange, enables GSA to apply the value of federal property to finance construction without relying on appropriated funds. Under such an exchange, GSA transfers the title of the unneeded property to a private investor after receiving the agreed upon construction services at another location. GSA proposed a swap exchange procurement for construction of a new FBI headquarters building in exchange for the Hoover Building and appropriations to compensate for the difference in value between the Hoover Building and the new building. GSA cancelled this procurement in July 2017 due to lack of funding. This statement addresses (1) GSA's and FBI's assessments of the Hoover Building, (2) GSA efforts to implement swap exchanges, and (3) alternative approaches to funding real property projects. It is based on GAO's body of reports on real property from 2011 to 2017, and selected updates from GSA. In November 2011, GAO reported that, according to General Services Administration (GSA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) assessments, the FBI's headquarters building (Hoover Building) and its accompanying facilities in Washington, D.C., did not fully support the FBI's long-term security, space, and building condition requirements. Since GAO's report, the assessments have not materially changed, for example: Security: GAO's prior work noted that the dispersion of staff in annexes creates security challenges, including where some space was leased by the FBI and other space was leased by nonfederal tenants. Earlier this year, GAO reported the FBI is leasing space in D.C. from foreign owners. Space : In 2011, GAO reported that FBI and GSA studies showed that much of the Hoover Building is unusable. GSA noted in its fiscal year 2017 project prospectus for the FBI headquarters consolidation that the Hoover Building cannot be redeveloped to meet the FBI's current needs. Building Condition: In GAO's 2011 report, GAO noted that the condition of the Hoover Building was deteriorating, and GSA assessments identified significant recapitalization needs. Since GAO's report and in response to GAO's recommendation, GSA has evaluated its approach to maintaining the building and completed some repairs to ensure safety. GSA has limited experience in successfully completing swap exchange transactions and chose not to pursue several proposed swap exchanges, most recently the planned swap exchange for the Hoover Building. GSA has developed criteria for determining when to solicit market interest in a swap exchange, in response to recommendations in GAO's 2014 report. In addition, GSA officials told GAO that they planned to improve the swap exchange process, including the property appraisal process, outreach to stakeholders to identify potential risks associated with future projects, and to the extent possible, mitigate such risks. Nevertheless, several factors may continue to limit use of swap exchanges, including market factors, such as the availability of alternative properties and an investor's approach for valuing properties. For example, in reviewing a proposed swap exchange in Washington, D.C., GAO found in a 2016 report that the proposals from two firms valued the two federal buildings involved in the proposed swap substantially less than GSA's appraised property value. In a 2014 report, GAO identified a number of alternative approaches to funding real property projects. Congress has provided some agencies with specific authorities to use alternative funding mechanisms—including the use of private sector funds or land swaps—for the acquisition, renovation, or disposal of federal real property without full, upfront funding, though GAO has previously reported that upfront funding is the best way to ensure recognition of commitments made in budgeting decisions and maintain fiscal controls. GAO has reported that projects with alternative funding mechanisms present multiple forms of risk that are shared between the agency and any partner or stakeholder. In addition, alternative budgetary structures could be established, such as changing existing or introducing new account structures to fund real property projects. GAO has made recommendations in the past to GSA on various real property issues, including to develop additional guidance for swap exchanges and to evaluate its approach to maintaining the Hoover Building.

The report also talks about the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 1991, which ensures that ex-servicemembers are treated the same as other unemployed workers regarding benefit levels, waiting periods, and duration.\n\nThe report goes on to explain that while federal laws and regulations provide broad guidelines on UC benefit coverage, eligibility, and determination, the specifics are determined by each state. This results in 53 different programs. Eligibility is based on qualified wages and employment in covered work over a 12-month period (base period) prior to unemployment. Each state has different methods to determine eligibility, with most replacing about half of a claimant's average weekly wage up to a weekly maximum. The eligibility requirements include that the worker lost their job through no fault of their own, and that they are able to work, available for work, and actively seeking work. These requirements ensure that benefits are directed toward workers with significant labor market experience and who are unemployed because of economic conditions.\n\nThe UI program is funded by federal taxes under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) and by state payroll taxes under each state's State Unemployment Tax Act (SUTA). The FUTA tax is 0.6% on the first $7,000 of each employee's earnings, which funds federal and state administrative costs, loans to insolvent state UC accounts, the federal share (50%) of EB payments, and state employment services. SUTA taxes are limited by federal", "answers": ["The 116th Congress has begun to consider several issues related to two programs in the unemployment insurance (UI) system: Unemployment Compensation (UC) and Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE). The lapse in federal appropriations that occurred from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019, created a partial government shutdown. As a result, agencies without funding furloughed many federal employees, and many federal employees excepted from furlough were working without pay during the lapse in appropriations. Furloughed federal employees may be eligible for UCFE benefits. Private-sector workers who are furloughed or laid off due to the partial government shutdown because they were employed by government contractors may be eligible for regular UC benefits. But, according to guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), excepted federal employees who are performing services (without pay) would generally be ineligible for UCFE benefits based on states' definitions of \"unemployment.\" In this climate, there has been congressional interest in assisting furloughed and excepted federal employees through the UI system. UI legislative issues currently facing the 116th Congress include the following: the effects of the FY2019 sequester order on UI programs and benefits, the role of UI in providing temporary income replacement during a government shutdown, state fiscal concerns related to financing UC benefits, reemployment services and eligibility assessments (RESEA), potential consideration of the UI proposals included in the President's FY2020 budget, and congressional oversight related to a proposed UC drug testing rule reissued by DOL after previously being disapproved using the Congressional Review Act. In the 116th Congress, policymakers have introduced legislation related to UCFE benefits in response to the recent partial government shutdown (S. 165, H.R. 720, H.R. 725, and H.R. 1117), legislation to provide self-employment and relocation assistance benefits (S. 136 and H.R. 556), legislation to require that states consider an individual who quit employment because of sexual harassment, domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking to be eligible for UC benefits (H.R. 1585), and legislation to amend Title III of the Social Security Act to extend RESEA to all UC claimants (H.R. 1759).

{"pred": " The report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) examines the Federal Bureau of Prisons' (BOP) use of retention incentives, internal controls, and strategic planning for human capital management. Key findings include:\n\n1. **Retention Incentives Usage**: BOP uses retention incentives to address staffing challenges, particularly in hard-to-fill positions such as medical professionals and correctional officers. These incentives are funded through the Salaries and Expenses appropriation account, which accounted for nearly 93% of BOP’s budget in FY 2016. The majority of BOP’s retention incentive expenditures were concentrated in four California institutions and for medical professionals nationwide. From FY 2012 to FY 2016, BOP spent an average of $14 million annually on retention incentives, with the number of employees receiving incentives increasing from 2,024 to 2,460. Medical professionals accounted for the largest portion of BOP’s retention incentive expenditures, increasing from $2.7 million to $5.8 million over the same period. The increase in retention incentive expenditures for medical professionals accounted for 92% of BOP’s total increase in retention incentive expenditures during the five-year period.\n\n2. **Internal Controls**: BOP has implemented a multi-layered internal control process for the use of retention incentives, which includes application review at the institution and regional levels, final approval at the Central Office, and annual re-certification to continue the incentive. The process involves ongoing communication between the various entities to ensure that applications are complete and accurate. Our review of a random sample of 40 application packet case files for retention incentives awarded from FY 2014 through FY 2016 found that they all generally incorporated the internal controls described by officials. The key controls in this process include: Application review at the institution and regional levels. According to BOP officials, the retention incentive application process begins with an institution’s human resources office, whose staff complete a retention incentive application on behalf of an employee. The institution’s human resources office verifies that the information in the application justifies a retention incentive and that funds are available to pay the incentive. Although it is not required, BOP officials said they use a retention incentive application checklist to help institutions ensure that applications are complete. The institution’s human resources office then submits the completed application packet, which includes supporting documentation, to the warden for review. Next, the application packet is forwarded to the respective BOP regional director who also reviews it for", "answers": ["BOP is the largest employer within DOJ and is responsible for the care and custody of an inmate population of about 186,000. BOP has faced challenges retaining staff at correctional facilities, although it has used retention incentives, along with other human capital flexibilities. GAO was asked to review BOP's use of retention incentives. This report addresses: (1) how BOP used its authority to pay retention incentives; (2) internal controls BOP has in place for the use of retention incentives; and (3) the extent to which BOP plans for and evaluates the use of retention incentives. GAO obtained employee-level retention incentive expenditure data from DOJ's Justice Management Division for fiscal years 2012 through 2016. GAO also reviewed agency documentation, such as policy statements and 40 randomly selected retention incentive application packet case files from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. GAO also interviewed officials from BOP's Central Office and four correctional facilities that use retention incentives, selected to reflect variation in the number and types of employees receiving retention incentives, BOP regions, and BOP institution security levels. From fiscal years 2012 to 2016, the Department of Justice's (DOJ) Federal Bureau of Prisons' (BOP) total retention incentive expenditures generally increased from $10.7 to $14.0 million and the number of employees receiving retention incentives increased from 2,024 to 2,460. During those five years, BOP spent more than 97 percent of its total retention incentive expenditures on employees at four BOP institutions in California and for medical professionals nationwide. Further, total retention incentive expenditures for medical professionals increased by an average of 21 percent per year (see figure). According to BOP officials, BOP uses retention incentives, for example, to supplement BOP's medical professionals' salaries which are generally lower than private sector salaries. BOP has a variety of internal controls in place throughout the retention incentive process that help ensure retention incentive applications and approvals meet requirements. For example, each application goes through multiple levels of review to verify its accuracy and completeness. BOP takes steps to determine workforce needs and how to fill those needs, but has not strategically planned for and evaluated its use of retention incentives. According to BOP, planning for human capital needs is conducted at institutions during quarterly meetings, but discussions about these incentives respond to short-term staffing situations rather than proactively addressing future staffing needs. Including human capital goals and strategies in BOP's human capital plan would create a roadmap so the agency could move from being reactive to its current workforce needs to being strategic in trying to achieve its long-term workforce goals. Additionally BOP has not evaluated the effectiveness of its use of retention incentives in retaining staff. As a result, BOP does not know whether retention incentives have contributed to employees' retention in relation to other incentives used by BOP. Consistent with key principles for strategic human capital planning, planning for and evaluating the use of retention incentives could help BOP better determine if these incentives are an efficient and effective means by which to retain staff. GAO recommends that BOP (1) include human capital goals and how retention incentives will be used to achieve these goals in its human capital plan; and (2) evaluate the use of retention incentives.

Once a defect is identified, auto manufacturers are required to send written notification to vehicle owners by mail. NHTSA also aims to enhance awareness of auto recalls by providing information on its website, NHTSA.gov . The Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act includes a provision requiring GAO to study the use of publicly available safety recall information. This report addresses: (1) how consumers and industry stakeholders use such information and (2) how easy to use do consumers find the auto recall areas of NHTSA.gov, among other objectives. To understand consumers' use of auto recall information and to test website usability, GAO conducted 12 focus groups with 94 consumers who had a recall. Focus groups were held in six locations selected for population and geographic variation. GAO identified key website usability practices and requested an evaluation by website usability professionals. GAO reviewed statutes, regulations, and NHTSA documents, and interviewed industry stakeholders—including 10 manufacturers selected based on sales market share and other factors. Consumers, manufacturers, and auto dealers use publicly available auto recall information differently. For example, the 94 consumers in 12 focus groups that GAO conducted used this information to decide whether to repair their vehicles. These consumers overwhelmingly cited safety risk and convenience as the two most influential factors they considered. Most consumers reported a preference for receiving recall notification by at least one electronic means, such as by e-mail or text message, in addition to mail. However, only 7 of 94 consumers reported receiving electronic notifications, suggesting a gap between the industry's auto recall notification practices and consumers' preferences. (See fig.). In response to a mandate in law, in September 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a proposed rule that, if finalized, would require manufacturers to notify consumers about auto recalls by electronic means in addition to mail. Most consumers in GAO's focus group website usability tests found the auto recall areas of NHTSA's website—NHTSA.gov—easy to use; however, some consumers experienced difficulties when asked to complete auto recall related tasks. For example, when consumers attempted to search for recalls affecting their specific vehicles, some found the search results confusing, leading them to question the accuracy of the results. Similarly, some consumers were hampered in searching for recalls by their vehicles' year, make, and model because the website did not always display model options using plain language. GAO found that the auto recall areas of NHTSA.gov do not always reflect federal and industry key website usability practices, and that an independent evaluation conducted by website usability professionals at GAO's request identified similar issues. NHTSA is in the process of consolidating its websites and plans to conduct a website usability study of NHTSA.gov with consumers after the consolidation is complete. However, the agency has not determined a completion date for the consolidation effort—an essential step for organizations to effectively guide their information technology efforts. Without establishing a completion date and taking interim steps to improve the usability of NHTSA.gov, consumers will likely continue to experience difficulties, which may limit the effectiveness of the website's primary means of providing consumers with information about recalls affecting their vehicles.

{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1 inch margins)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report on cluster munitions. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nFirst, the report explains what cluster munitions are. They are weapons that open in mid-air and release submunitions, which can range from a few dozen to hundreds. These can be delivered by aircraft or ground systems like artillery, rockets, and missiles. The military values them because one munition can target many, reducing the number of weapons systems needed. They're also considered an \"economy of force\" weapon, allowing a smaller force to engage a larger adversary.\n\nThen there's the part about the submunitions. Older ones use mechanical fuzes that arm based on spin and explode on impact or after a delay. Newer ones are sensor-fuzed, which improve accuracy and reduce unexploded ordnance. These are designed to target vehicles without creating a hazard area. The report mentions that cluster bombs were first used in WWII and have been used in 21 states by 13 countries. Examples include the US in Southeast Asia, Soviets in Afghanistan, British in Falklands, Coalition in Gulf War, and factions in Yugoslavia. Specific numbers are given for NATO's use in Kosovo, the US in Afghanistan, and Iraq.\n\nThe report also discusses the humanitarian impact, such as the high number of unexploded submunitions remaining after conflicts, leading to civilian casualties. The failure rate of submunitions is a significant issue, with discrepancies between manufacturers and mine clearance specialists. Factors affecting reliability include delivery technique, age, temperature, landing in soft ground, vegetation, and damage after dispersal. \"Dumb\" submunitions without self-destruct are a major concern because they can remain hazardous for decades. Some nations are developing \"smart\" or sensor-fuzed weapons with greater reliability and self-destruct mechanisms to address the residual hazard. However, experts note that self-destruct features reduce but do not eliminate the unexploded ordnance problem, and the advantage gained by using \"smart\" cluster munitions is negated when high-failure rate and/or \"dumb\" cluster munitions are used in the same area.\n\nThe report then talks about the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM), which was negotiated by 51 states in 1980. It entered into force in 1983, initially covering incendi", "answers": ["Cluster munitions are air-dropped or ground-launched weapons that release a number of smaller submunitions intended to kill enemy personnel or destroy vehicles. Cluster munitions were developed in World War II and are part of many nations' weapons stockpiles. Cluster munitions have been used frequently in combat, including the early phases of the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Cluster munitions have been highly criticized internationally for causing a significant number of civilian deaths, and efforts have been undertaken to ban and regulate their use. The Department of Defense (DOD) continues to view cluster munitions as a military necessity but in 2008 instituted a policy to reduce the failure rate of cluster munitions to 1% or less after 2018. In November 2017, a new DOD policy was issued that essentially reversed the 2008 policy. Under the new policy, combatant commanders can use cluster munitions that do not meet the 1% or less unexploded submunitions standard in extreme situations to meet immediate warfighting demands. In addition, the new policy does not establish a deadline to replace cluster munitions exceeding the 1% rate and states that DOD \"will retain cluster munitions currently in active inventories until the capabilities they provide are replaced with enhanced and more reliable munitions.\" Potential issues for Congress include cluster munitions in an era of precision weapons, other weapons in lieu of cluster munitions, and the potential impact of DOD's 2017 revised cluster munitions policy."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3162}

The program is managed by FEMA's Office of Response and Recovery and involves a mix of temporary, reservist, and permanent employees under the Stafford Act and Title 5. Reservists make up the majority of the PA workforce, with 1,852 employees as of June 2017, including 1,041 reservists, 634 full-time equivalents, and 177 temporary Cadre of On-Call Response/Recovery Employees. The PA program includes a variety of federal response and recovery programs for government and nongovernmental entities, households, and individuals. FEMA's staff includes a mix of temporary, reservist, and permanent employees under two authorities, the Stafford Act and Title 5. Reservists make up the largest share of the PA workforce, which consisted of 1,852 employees—as of June 2017, according to PA officials. The report also discusses the key characteristics for each type of employee, as shown in Figure 2. After a disaster, FEMA sends PA program staff to the affected area to work with state and local officials to assess the damage prior to a disaster declaration. FEMA officials establish a temporary Joint Field Office (JFO) to house staff who will manage response and recovery functions after a declared disaster (including operations, emergency response and support teams, planning, administration, finance, and logistics). Once the President has declared a disaster, PA staff work with grant applicants to help them document damages, identify eligible costs and work, and prepare requests for PA grant funds by developing project proposals. These proposals may include proposals for hazard mitigation if the hazard mitigation work is related to the repair of disaster-damaged facilities, referred to as permanent work projects. Immediate emergency measures, such as debris removal, are not eligible for hazard mitigation. Officials then review and obtain approval of the projects prior to FEMA obligating funds to state grantees. Figure 3 describes the process used to develop, review, and obligate PA projects.

Further, costs are rising with disasters, such as Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in 2017. FEMA recently redesigned how the PA program delivers assistance to state and local grantees to improve operations and address past challenges identified by GAO and others. FEMA tested the new delivery model in selected disasters and announced implementation in September 2017. GAO was asked to assess the redesigned PA program. This report examines, among other things, the extent to which FEMA's new delivery model addresses (1) past workforce management challenges and assesses future workforce needs; and (2) past information sharing challenges and key IT management controls. GAO reviewed FEMA policy, strategy, and implementation documents; interviewed FEMA and state officials, PA program applicants, and other stakeholders; and observed implementation of the new model at one test location following Hurricane Matthew in 2016. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) redesigned the Public Assistance (PA) grant program delivery model to address past challenges in workforce management, but has not fully assessed future workforce staffing needs. GAO and others have previously identified challenges related to shortages in experienced and trained FEMA PA staff and high turnover among these staff. These challenges often led to applicants receiving inconsistent guidance and to PA project delays. As part of its new model, FEMA is creating consolidated resource centers to standardize and centralize PA staff responsible for managing grant applications, and new specialized positions, such as hazard mitigation liaisons, program delivery managers, and site inspectors, to ensure more consistent guidance to applicants. However, FEMA has not assessed the workforce needed to fully implement the new model, such as the number of staff needed to fill certain new positions, or to achieve staffing goals for supporting hazard mitigation on PA projects. Fully assessing workforce needs will help to ensure that FEMA has the people and the skills needed to fully implement the new PA model and help to avoid the long-standing workforce challenges the program encountered in the past. FEMA designed a new PA information and case management system—called the FEMA Applicant Case Tracker (FAC-Trax)—to address past information sharing challenges, such as difficulties in sharing grant documentation among FEMA, state, and local officials and tracking the status of PA projects, but additional actions could better ensure effective implementation. Both FEMA and state officials involved in testing of the new model stated that the new information system allows them to better manage and track PA applications and documentation, which could lead to greater transparency and efficiencies in the program. Further, GAO found that this new system fully addresses two of four key information technology (IT) management controls—project planning and risk management—that are necessary to ensure systems work effectively and meet user needs. However, GAO found that FEMA has not fully addressed the other two controls—requirements development and systems testing and integration. By better analyzing progress on high-level user requirements, for example, FEMA will have greater assurance that FAC-Trax will meet user needs and achieve the goals of the new delivery model. GAO is making five recommendations, including that FEMA assess the workforce needed for the new delivery model and improve key IT management controls for its new information sharing and case management system, FAC-Trax.

DOE's Weatherization Assistance Program and State Energy Program would be terminated under the FY2020 budget request. The Administration had proposed to eliminate the grants in FY2018 and FY2019, but Congress continued funding. Reductions in Energy Research and Development. Under the FY2020 budget request, DOE research and development appropriations would be reduced for energy efficiency and renewable energy (EERE) by 83%, nuclear energy by 38%, and fossil energy by 24%. Similar reductions proposed by the Administration for FY2019 were not enacted. Nuclear Waste Repository. The Administration's budget request would provide new funding for the first time since FY2010 for a proposed nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, NV. DOE would receive $116 million to seek an NRC license for the repository and develop interim waste storage capacity. NRC would receive $38.5 million to consider DOE's repository license application.

{"pred": " The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a division of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is responsible for disease prevention, control, and public health education. The agency also leads national efforts to detect, respond to, and prevent illnesses resulting from natural causes or the release of biological, chemical, or radiological agents. To achieve its mission, the CDC relies on partnerships with public health associations and state and local public health agencies, as well as its staff located in foreign countries to aid in international efforts. The report highlights the CDC's extensive use of information technology to fulfill its mission and support administrative needs, with approximately 750 systems dedicated to public health science, practice, and administration. These systems rely on an information technology infrastructure that includes network components, critical servers, and data centers. The CDC's chief information officer (CIO) is responsible for establishing and enforcing policies and procedures protecting information resources. The CIO is to lead the efforts to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information and systems that support the agency and its operations, and is to report quarterly to the HHS CIO on the overall effectiveness of CDC’s information security and privacy program, including the progress of remedial actions. The CIO designated a chief information security officer (CISO), who is to oversee compliance with applicable information security and privacy requirements of the agency. The CISO, among other things, is responsible for providing information security protections commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, and disruption of information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency. To further ensure information security compliance, information systems security officers (ISSO) are responsible for managing the information security program within their respective organizations and report on security program matters to the CISO, including computer security-related incidents. ISSO responsibilities include ensuring that vendor-issued security patches are expeditiously installed and that system owners establish processes for timely removal of access privileges when a user’s system access is no longer necessary. In addition, security stewards are to perform operational security analyses supporting the efforts of the ISSO. Further, business stewards serve as program managers, accepting full accountability for the operations of the systems and ensuring that security is planned, documented, and properly resourced for each aspect of the information security program. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014 provides a comprehensive framework for ensuring the effectiveness of information security controls over information resources that support federal operations and", "answers": ["CDC is responsible for detecting and responding to emerging health threats and controlling dangerous substances. In carrying out its mission, CDC relies on information technology systems to receive, process, and maintain sensitive data. Accordingly, effective information security controls are essential to ensure that the agency's systems and information are protected from misuse and modification. GAO was asked to examine information security at CDC. In June 2018, GAO issued a limited official use only report on the extent to which CDC had effectively implemented technical controls and an information security program to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information on selected information systems. This current report is a public version of the June 2018 report. In addition, for this public report, GAO determined the extent to which CDC has taken corrective actions to address the previously identified security program and technical control deficiencies and related recommendations for improvement. For this report, GAO reviewed supporting documents regarding CDC's actions on previously identified recommendations and interviewed personnel at CDC. As GAO reported in June 2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) implemented technical controls and an information security program that were intended to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information systems and information. However, GAO identified control and program deficiencies in the core security functions related to identifying risk, protecting systems from threats and vulnerabilities, detecting and responding to cyber security events, and recovering system operations (see table below). GAO made 195 recommendations to address these deficiencies. As of August 2018, CDC had made significant progress in resolving many of the security deficiencies by implementing 102 of 184 (about 55 percent) technical control recommendations, and partially implementing 1 of 11 information security program recommendations made in the June 2018 report. The figure shows the status of CDC's efforts to implement the 195 recommendations. Additionally, CDC has created remedial action plans to implement the majority of the remaining open recommendations by September 2019. Until CDC implements these recommendations and resolves the associated deficiencies, its information systems and information will remain at increased risk of misuse, improper disclosure or modification, and destruction."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10203}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this detailed report about the U.S. involvement in the Saudi-led coalition's military operations in Yemen. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points and structure.\n\nThe report begins by explaining the context of the conflict. In March 2015, Saudi Arabia formed a coalition to fight the Houthi movement and the late President of Yemen, Ali Abdullah Saleh. The U.S. joined in supporting this effort, providing logistical and intelligence support without direct military action. A joint planning cell was established between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia to coordinate military and intelligence support for the campaign. The U.S. supported the passage of UN Security Council Resolution 2216, which imposed an arms embargo on the Houthi-Saleh forces and demanded their withdrawal from all areas seized during the conflict.\n\nThen, the report discusses the role of Congress in overseeing U.S. policy in the Arabian Peninsula. Members have considered legislative proposals to reduce civilian casualties from coalition operations, improve humanitarian conditions, end restrictions on goods and aid, combat Iranian support for the Houthis, preserve maritime security in the Bab al Mandab Strait, and support continued coalition and U.S. efforts against Al Qaeda and Islamic State forces in Yemen. The conflict is viewed through the lens of a broader regional rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and the U.S. effort to limit Iran's malign regional influence. Some lawmakers have viewed the Yemen conflict as indicative of what they perceive as problems in the U.S.-Saudi relationship, especially after the killing of Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018. Congress has debated but not enacted proposals to curtail or condition U.S. defense sales to Saudi Arabia. The report also mentions that the Yemen conflict has reinvigorated some Members' interest in strengthening the role of Congress in foreign policy vis-à-vis the executive branch. Debate in Congress over Yemen has featured bipartisan statements of interest in asserting the prerogatives of the legislative branch to limit executive branch power, specifically using war powers legislation and the appropriations and authorization processes to curb U.S. military involvement in support of coalition operations.\n\nThe report then goes into the timeline of events, starting with the initial intervention in March 2015. The U.S. provided support without direct military action. The coalition's operations led to international criticism, especially regarding civilian casualties. Congress became more involved, with members expressing concerns about the humanitarian crisis and the coalition's behavior. Some", "answers": ["This product provides an overview of the role Congress has played in shaping U.S. policy toward the conflict in Yemen. Summary tables provide information on legislative proposals considered in the 115th and 116th Congresses. Various legislative proposals have reflected a range of congressional perspectives and priorities, including with regard to the authorization of the activities of the U.S. Armed Forces related to the conflict; the extent of U.S. logistical, material, advisory, and intelligence support for the coalition led by Saudi Arabia; the approval, disapproval, or conditioning of U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia; the appropriation of funds for U.S. operations in support of the Saudi-led coalition; the conduct of the Saudi-led coalition's air campaign and its adherence to international humanitarian law and the laws of armed conflict; the demand for greater humanitarian access to Yemen; the call for a wider government assessment of U.S. policy toward Yemen and U.S. support to parties to the conflict; the nature and extent of U.S.-Saudi counterterrorism and border security cooperation; and the role of Iran in supplying missile technology and other weapons to the forces of the Houthi movement. The 116th Congress may continue to debate U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition and Saudi Arabia's conduct of the war in Yemen, where fighting has continued since March 2015. The war has exacerbated a humanitarian crisis in Yemen that began in 2011; presently, the World Food Program reports that 20 million Yemenis face hunger in the absence of sustained food assistance. The difficulty of accessing certain areas of Yemen has made it hard for governments and aid agencies to count the war's casualties. Data collected by the U.S. and European-funded Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) suggest that 60,000 Yemenis have been killed since January 2016. The Trump Administration has opposed various congressional proposals, including initiatives to reject or condition proposed U.S. arms sales or to require an end to U.S. military support to Saudi-led coalition operations in Yemen. Many in Congress have condemned the October 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi government personnel, and in general, the incident appears to have exacerbated existing congressional concerns about Saudi leaders and the pace, scope, and direction of change in the kingdom's policies.
