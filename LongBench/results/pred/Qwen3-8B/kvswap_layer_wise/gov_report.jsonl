{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about multiyear procurement (MYP) and block buy contracting (BBC). Let me start by understanding the main points.\n\nThe report is for Congress, explaining MYP and BBC, which are special contracting methods allowed for the Department of Defense (DOD). These methods can reduce weapon procurement costs by a few or several percent compared to annual contracting. The report discusses potential issues for Congress regarding the use of MYP and BBC, such as whether to use them more, less, or about as frequently as now. Also, whether to create a permanent statute for BBC, similar to the one for MYP. And whether the Coast Guard should start using MYP and BBC.\n\nThe report explains that MYP and BBC are different from annual contracting. Under MYP, the DOD uses a single contract for two to five years of procurement, without needing to exercise a contract option for each year after the first year. For BBC, it's similar, but with no permanent statute, and no requirement for approval in both appropriations and authorization acts. The report also mentions that the Coast Guard is part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), but is a military service and can use MYP. The Coast Guard has never used MYP or BBC in their ship or aircraft acquisition programs. The report discusses the potential savings from MYP and BBC, which can range from less than 5% to more than 15%, with many estimates in the range of 5% to 10%. However, actual savings can be hard to observe or verify due to cost growth during the contract execution caused by developments independent of the use of MYP or BBC. \n\nThe report also compares MYP and BBC. MYP is a multiyear contract, while BBC is a type of contract that can be used for longer periods. The report mentions that BBC is a less formal alternative to MYP. The report also discusses the potential issues with MYP and BBC, such as the loss of flexibility in making procurement changes in response to changing strategic or budgetary circumstances. Also, the lack of comprehensive records and historical information that could be used to enhance oversight and knowledge about multiyear performance to inform and improve future multiyear procurement candidates. \n\nThe report also talks about the difference between MYP and BBC. For example, the Navy used BBC for the first four Virginia-class submarines, and for the Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) program. The report also discusses the difference between block", "answers": ["Multiyear procurement (MYP) and block buy contracting (BBC) are special contracting mechanisms that Congress permits the Department of Defense (DOD) to use for a limited number of defense acquisition programs. Compared to the standard or default approach of annual contracting, MYP and BBC have the potential for reducing weapon procurement costs by a few or several percent. Under annual contracting, DOD uses one or more contracts for each year's worth of procurement of a given kind of item. Under MYP, DOD instead uses a single contract for two to five years' worth of procurement of a given kind of item without having to exercise a contract option for each year after the first year. DOD needs congressional approval for each use of MYP. There is a permanent statute governing MYP contracting—10 U.S.C. 2306b. Under this statute, a program must meet several criteria to qualify for MYP. Compared with estimated costs under annual contracting, estimated savings for programs being proposed for MYP have ranged from less than 5% to more than 15%, depending on the particulars of the program in question, with many estimates falling in the range of 5% to 10%. In practice, actual savings from using MYP rather than annual contracting can be difficult to observe or verify because of cost growth during the execution of the contract due to changes in the program independent of the use of MYP rather than annual contracting. BBC is similar to MYP in that it permits DOD to use a single contract for more than one year's worth of procurement of a given kind of item without having to exercise a contract option for each year after the first year. BBC is also similar to MYP in that DOD needs congressional approval for each use of BBC. BBC differs from MYP in the following ways: There is no permanent statute governing the use of BBC. There is no requirement that BBC be approved in both a DOD appropriations act and an act other than a DOD appropriations act. Programs being considered for BBC do not need to meet any legal criteria to qualify for BBC, because there is no permanent statute governing the use of BBC that establishes such criteria. A BBC contract can cover more than five years of planned procurements. Economic order quantity (EOQ) authority—the authority to bring forward selected key components of the items to be procured under the contract and purchase the components in batch form during the first year or two of the contract—does not come automatically as part of BBC authority because there is no permanent statute governing the use of BBC that includes EOQ authority as an automatic feature. BBC contracts are less likely to include cancellation penalties. Potential issues for Congress concerning MYP and BBC include whether to use MYP and BBC in the future more frequently, less frequently, or about as frequently as they are currently used; whether to create a permanent statute to govern the use of BBC, analogous to the permanent statute that governs the use of MYP; and whether the Coast Guard should begin making use of MYP and BBC."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8537}

The total inventory of these aircraft is 2,823 units, with an annual operating and support costs of approximately $20 billion in fiscal year 2016. The report outlines the Department of Defense (DOD) policy that requires services to develop and implement sustainment strategies, such as Life-cycle Sustainment Plan, to ensure the long-term support of these systems. According to the policy, these strategies should be the basis for all sustainment efforts, including sustainment metrics mapped to key performance parameters and key system attributes, such as aircraft availability, to manage sustainment performance. The report also discusses the sustainment challenges, including aging aircraft, maintenance issues, and supply chain problems, which have led to a decrease in aircraft availability for 6 of the 12 aircraft and the aircraft generally not meeting availability goals. For example, in fiscal year 2016, 9 of the 12 aircraft did not meet their availability goals. The report identifies that the sustainment challenges include aging, maintenance, and supply support, which have contributed to the decrease in availability for 6 of the 12 aircraft. The report also highlights the significant financial investment, with the total operating and support costs for the 12 aircraft in our review totaling about $20 billion annually since 2011.

The Air Force and Navy are operating many of their fixed-wing aircraft well beyond their original designed service lives and therefore are confronted with sustainment challenges. House Report 114-537 included a provision for GAO to evaluate the sustainment of major weapon systems. This report, among other things, (1) examines the trends in availability and O&S costs for selected Air Force and Navy fixed-wing aircraft since fiscal year 2011, including whether they met availability goals, and (2) assesses the extent that the departments documented sustainment strategies, reviewed sustainment metrics, and implemented plans to improve aircraft availability. GAO selected a nongeneralizable sample of 12 fixed-wing aircraft by considering a variety of factors, such as the type, age, and manufacturer of the aircraft, among other factors, and analyzed condition and availability data, O&S costs, and sustainment challenges from fiscal year 2011 through March 2017 for each aircraft in a “Sustainment Quick Look.” GAO also analyzed policies, strategies, and plans, and interviewed Navy and Air Force officials in program offices, squadrons, and maintenance depots. Between fiscal years 2011 and 2016, the Air Force and Navy generally did not meet aircraft availability goals, and operating and support (O&S) cost trends for GAO's selected fixed-wing aircraft varied. Specifically, GAO found that availability declined for 6 of 12 aircraft—3 from each service—between fiscal years 2011 and 2016; availability fell short of goals for 9 of 12 aircraft in fiscal year 2016; and O&S costs increased for 5 of the aircraft, and maintenance costs—the largest share—increased for 8 of 12 aircraft. GAO found, and officials agreed, that these aircraft face similar challenges. a Obsolescence means a part is unavailable due to its lack of usefulness or it is no longer current or available for production. b Diminishing manufacturing sources is a loss or impending loss of manufacturers or suppliers. The Air Force and Navy have documented sustainment strategies for some aircraft, regularly reviewed sustainment metrics, and implemented improvement plans. The Air Force has documented sustainment strategies for all aircraft GAO reviewed; however, the Navy has not documented or updated its sustainment strategies for four aircraft. Specifically, the Navy does not have a documented sustainment strategy for the C-2A, and has not updated the strategies for the E2C, EA-18G, and F/A-18A-D since before 2012. The Navy is in the process of documenting its strategies, but Department of Defense (DOD) policy is unclear on whether a sustainment strategy is required and has to be updated every 5 years for weapon systems that are in the operations and support phase of their life cycle (i.e., legacy systems). Also, Navy guidance does not specify a requirement for legacy systems, although Air Force guidance does. Clarifying the requirements to document sustainment strategies for legacy systems, and documenting those strategies, would add additional visibility over the availability and O&S costs of DOD aircraft and any associated sustainment risks. This is a public version of a sensitive report issued in April 2018. Information on aircraft availability and other related information was deemed to be sensitive and has been omitted from this report.

{"pred": " \n\nThe report highlights the global scale and growing threat of wildlife trafficking, which is a transnational criminal activity with significant environmental, security, and economic consequences. According to the United Nations and other organizations, the illegal wildlife trade is estimated to range from $7 billion to $23 billion annually, with recent increases in environmental crime contributing to this trend. In the United States, wildlife trafficking involves a wide range of species, including live reptiles, birds, mammals, and products like elephant ivory. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are responsible for enforcing laws and treaties that prohibit wildlife trafficking. The FWS Office of Law Enforcement has a budget of $74.7 million and employs 205 special agents to investigate wildlife crime, including international and domestic trafficking rings. The NOAA Office of Law Enforcement has a budget of $68.6 million and employs 77 special agents to investigate wildlife crime, including marine species. Both agencies have policies on financial rewards for information on wildlife trafficking, and NOAA's policy specifies factors for agents to consider when developing proposed reward amounts. However, the report also notes that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and NOAA have not prioritized the use of financial rewards in combating wildlife trafficking. The report found that FWS and NOAA have paid very few financial rewards for information on wildlife trafficking from fiscal years 2007 through 2017. The agencies reported paying 25 rewards totaling $184,500 to individuals who provided information on wildlife trafficking cases, and NOAA reported paying 2 rewards totaling $21,000. However, the agencies could not provide sufficient assurance that these figures represented all the rewards paid during that period. The report also discusses the use of financial rewards to obtain information on wildlife trafficking, including the potential advantages and disadvantages of using financial rewards. While financial rewards can provide incentives for people with information to come forward, they may also generate false or unproductive leads, affect witness credibility, and consume resources. The report outlines the policies of FWS and NOAA on financial rewards, including the process for requesting and approving financial rewards. For example, NOAA's policy specifies factors for agents to consider when developing proposed reward amounts, such as the benefit to marine resources, the risk the individual took, the probability of success without the information, and the relationship between fines and the information provided. However, FWS's policy does not specify such factors, which", "answers": ["Wildlife trafficking—the poaching and illegal trade of plants, fish, and wildlife—is a multibillion-dollar, global criminal activity that imperils thousands of species. FWS and NOAA enforce laws prohibiting wildlife trafficking that authorize the agencies to pay financial rewards for information about such illegal activities. GAO was asked to review FWS's and NOAA's use of financial rewards to combat wildlife trafficking. This report examines (1) laws that authorize FWS and NOAA to pay rewards for information on wildlife trafficking and the extent to which the agencies paid such rewards from fiscal years 2007 through 2017, (2) the agencies' reward policies, (3) information available to the public on rewards, and (4) the extent to which the agencies reviewed the effectiveness of their use of rewards. GAO reviewed laws, examined FWS and NOAA policies and public communications on rewards, analyzed agency reward data for fiscal years 2007 through 2017 and assessed their reliability, interviewed FWS and NOAA officials, and compared agency policies and public communications on rewards to federal internal control standards. Multiple laws—such as the Endangered Species Act and Lacey Act—authorize the Departments of the Interior's U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to pay rewards for information on wildlife trafficking. FWS and NOAA reported paying few rewards from fiscal years 2007 through 2017. Specifically, the agencies collectively reported paying 27 rewards, totaling $205,500. Agency officials said that the information was complete to the best of their knowledge but could not sufficiently assure that this information represented all of their reward payments. FWS and NOAA have reward policies that outline the general process for preparing reward proposals, but FWS's policy does not specify factors for its agents to consider when developing proposed reward amounts. Some FWS agents GAO interviewed said that in developing proposals, they did not know whether their proposed reward amounts were enough, too little, or too much. By augmenting its policy to specify factors for agents to consider, FWS can better ensure that its agents have the necessary quality information to prepare proposed reward amounts, consistent with federal internal control standards. FWS and NOAA communicate little information to the public on rewards. For example, most agency websites did not indicate that providing information on wildlife trafficking could qualify for a reward. This is inconsistent with federal standards that call for management to communicate quality information so that external parties can help achieve agency objectives. FWS and NOAA officials said they have not communicated general reward information because of workload concerns, but they said it may be reasonable to provide more information in some instances. By developing plans to communicate more reward information to the public, the agencies can improve their chances of obtaining information on wildlife trafficking that they otherwise might not receive. FWS and NOAA have not reviewed the effectiveness of their use of rewards. The agencies have not done so because using rewards has generally not been a priority. FWS and NOAA officials agreed that such a review would be worthwhile but provided no plans for doing so. By reviewing the effectiveness of their use of rewards, FWS and NOAA can identify opportunities to improve the usefulness of rewards as a tool for combating wildlife trafficking. GAO is making seven recommendations, including that FWS and NOAA track reward information, FWS augment its reward policy to specify factors for agents to consider when developing proposed reward amounts, FWS and NOAA develop plans to communicate more reward information to the public, and FWS and NOAA review the effectiveness of their reward use.

{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report about cross-border data flows and their implications. Let me start by reading through the report again to get the main points.\n\nThe report discusses how cross-border data flows are essential for global trade and commerce. They enable online communication, track supply chains, share research, and provide services. A study says digital commerce driven by data flows contributes 22% of global economic output, and global GDP could rise by $2 trillion by 2020 due to tech advances. However, these flows also raise privacy and security concerns. The U.S. is considering policy options to address online privacy, which could affect data flows. The U.S. has aimed to eliminate trade barriers and establish enforceable international rules and best practices to achieve public policy objectives, including promoting online security and privacy. Building consensus on international rules and norms for data flows and privacy is crucial as data breaches and scandals like Cambridge Analytica increase public awareness. The U.S. has traditionally supported open data flows and regulated privacy at a sectoral level. However, other countries are developing data privacy policies that affect international trade. Blocking data flows may act as trade protectionism. The report mentions that the U.S. has been working on trade agreements to address these issues. It also talks about different countries' approaches, like the EU's GDPR and China's cybersecurity laws. The U.S. seeks a balance between trade, privacy, and security. The U.S. has been involved in international forums like OECD, APEC, and G-20 to develop best practices and principles. The U.S. has been part of the e-commerce initiative under the WTO. The report highlights the need for international cooperation to create interoperable rules that allow for cross-border data flows while ensuring privacy and security. It also mentions the challenges in balancing these objectives and the potential economic impacts of different policies. The U.S. has been part of the e-commerce initiative under the WTO. The report concludes that finding a global consensus on data flows and privacy is key to maintaining trust in the digital environment and advancing international trade.\n\nOkay, so the key points are: importance of cross-border data flows for global economy, the economic benefits, the privacy and security risks, U.S. policy considerations, and the need for international cooperation. I need to condense all that into a one-page summary. Let me structure it with an introduction, main points, and a", "answers": ["\"Cross-border data flows\" refers to the movement or transfer of information between computer servers across national borders. Such data flows enable people to transmit information for online communication, track global supply chains, share research, provide cross-border services, and support technological innovation. Ensuring open cross-border data flows has been an objective of Congress in recent trade agreements and in broader U.S. international trade policy. The free flow of personal data, however, has raised security and privacy concerns. U.S. trade policy has traditionally sought to balance the need for cross-border data flows, which often include personal data, with online privacy and security. Some stakeholders, including some Members of Congress, believe that U.S. policy should better protect personal data privacy and security, and have introduced legislation to set a national policy. Other policymakers and analysts are concerned about increasing foreign barriers to U.S. digital trade, including data flows. Recent incidents of private information being shared or exposed have heightened public awareness of the risks posed to personal data stored online. Consumers' personal online data is valued by organizations for a variety of reasons, such as analyzing marketing information and easing the efficiency of transactions. Concerns are likely to grow as the amount of online data organizations collect and the level of global data flows expand. As Congress assesses policy options, it may further explore the link between cross-border data flows, online privacy, and trade policy; the trade implications of a comprehensive data privacy policy; and the U.S. role in establishing best practices and binding trade rules that seek to balance public policy priorities. There is no globally accepted standard or definition of data privacy in the online world, and there are no comprehensive binding multilateral rules specifically about cross-border data flows and privacy. Several international organizations, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), G-20, and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, have sought to develop best practice guidelines or principles related to privacy and cross-border data flows, although none are legally binding. U.S. and other recent trade agreements are establishing new enforceable trade rules and disciplines. Countries vary in their data policies and laws; some focus on limiting access to online information by restricting the flow of data beyond a country's borders, aiming to protect domestic interests (e.g., constituents' privacy). However, these policies can also act as protectionist measures. The EU and China, two top U.S. trading partners, have established prescriptive rules on cross-border data flows and personal data from different perspectives. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is driven by privacy concerns; China is focused on security. Their policies affect U.S. firms seeking to do business in those regions, as well as in other markets that emulate the EU and Chinese approaches. Unlike the EU or China, the United States does not broadly restrict cross-border data flows and has traditionally regulated privacy at a sectoral level to cover data, such as health records. U.S. trade policy has sought to balance the goals of consumer privacy, security, and open commerce. The proposed United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) represents the Trump Administration's first attempt to include negotiated trade rules and disciplines on privacy, cross-border data flows, and security in a trade agreement. While the United States and other countries work to define their respective national privacy strategies, many stakeholders seek a more global approach that would allow interoperability between differing national regimes to facilitate and remove discriminatory trade barriers to cross-border data flows; this could offer an opportunity for the United States to lead the global conversation. Although Congress has examined issues surrounding online privacy and has considered multiple bills, there is not yet consensus on a comprehensive U.S. online data privacy policy.

{"pred": " The report outlines the federal government's role in supporting airport infrastructure development through various funding mechanisms. The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) is a key initiative that provides federal grants to airports for planning and development, particularly for capital projects related to aircraft operations such as runways and taxiways. In addition to AIP, airports can impose a Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) on each boarding passenger, subject to federal approval. PFC revenues are used for a broader range of projects, including landside facilities like passenger terminals and ground access improvements. Additionally, federal law grants investors preferential income tax treatment on interest income from bonds issued by state and local governments for airport improvements. Airports may also draw on state and local funds and on operating revenues such as lease payments and landing fees. The federal government's involvement in airport infrastructure began during World War II, when national defense needs led to the first major federal support for airport construction. Prior to the war, airports were primarily local or private responsibilities, with federal support limited to the tax exclusion of municipal bond interest. After the war, the Federal Airport Act of 1946 (P.L. 79-377) continued federal aid, although at lower levels than during the war years. Initially, much of this spending supported conversion of military airports to civilian use. In the 1960s, substantial funding also went to upgrade and extend runways for use by commercial jets. In 1970, Congress responded to increasing congestion, both in the air and on the ground at U.S. airports, by passing two laws. The first, the Airport and Airway Development Act, established the forerunner programs of AIP: the Airport Development Aid Program and the Planning Grant Program. The second, the Airport and Airway Trust Fund (AATF, also referred to as the Aviation Trust Fund. The Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 (P.L. 97-248) created the current AIP and reactivated the trust fund. The report details the evolution of federal support for airport development, starting from World War II, through the Federal Airport Act of 11946, and into the current AIP. It discusses the different funding sources, including the AIP grants, Passenger Facility Charges (PFCs), tax-exempt bonds, and state and local grants. The AIP is funded through the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, which is supported by various aviation-related taxes. The report also", "answers": ["There are five major sources of airport capital development funding: the federal Airport Improvement Program (AIP); local passenger facility charges (PFCs) imposed pursuant to federal law; tax-exempt bonds; state and local grants; and airport operating revenue from tenant lease and other revenue-generating activities such as landing fees. Federal involvement is most consequential in AIP, PFCs, and tax-exempt financing. The AIP has been providing federal grants for airport development and planning since the passage of the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 (P.L. 97-248). AIP funding is usually spent on projects that support aircraft operations such as runways, taxiways, aprons, noise abatement, land purchase, and safety or emergency equipment. The funds obligated for AIP are drawn from the airport and airway trust fund, which is supported by a variety of user fees and fuel taxes. Different airports use different combinations of these sources depending on the individual airport's financial situation and the type of project being considered. Although smaller airports' individual grants are of much smaller dollar amounts than the grants going to large and medium hub airports, the smaller airports are much more dependent on AIP to meet their capital needs. This is particularly the case for noncommercial airports, which received over 25% of AIP grants distributed in FY2018. Larger airports are much more likely to issue tax-exempt bonds or finance capital projects with the proceeds of PFCs. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-254) provided annual AIP funding of $3.35 billion from the airport and airway trust fund for five years from FY2019 to FY2023. The act left the basic structure of AIP unchanged, but authorized supplemental annual funding of over $1 billion from the general fund to the AIP discretionary funds, starting with $1.02 billion in FY2019, and required at least 50% of the additional discretionary funds to be available to nonhub and small hub airports. The act included a provision permitting eligible projects at small airports (including those in the State Block Grant Program) to receive a 95% federal share of project costs (otherwise capped at 90%), if such projects are determined to be successive phases of a multiphase construction project that received a grant in FY2011. The 2018 reauthorization expanded the number of states that could participate in the State Block Grant Program from 10 to 20 and also expanded the existing airport privatization pilot program (now renamed the Airport Investment Partnership Program) to include more than 10 airports. The law included a provision that forbids states or local governments from levying or collecting taxes on a business at an airport that \"is not generally imposed on sales or services by that State, political subdivision, or authority unless wholly utilized for airport or aeronautical purposes.\" The airport improvement issues Congress generally faces in the context of FAA reauthorization include the following: Should airport development funding be increased or decreased? Should the $4.50 ceiling on PFCs be eliminated, raised, or kept as it is? Could AIP be restructured to address congestion at the busiest U.S. airports, or should a large share of AIP resources continue to go to noncommercial airports that lack other sources of funding? Should Congress set tighter limits on the purposes for which AIP and PFC funds may be spent?

These funds are authorized by law and allocated annually through the National Defense Authorization Act, which sets specific funding levels for various projects. The process for requesting funding involves the use of DOD's Form 1391, which includes details about the project's scope, costs, and requirements. The form is used for both new and urgent projects, and it must be completed at the installation level before being submitted for approval. MILCON appropriations are generally available for 5 years, after which any remaining unobligated or unobligated funds are canceled and returned to the U.S. Treasury. The report also outlines the process for reprogramming funds, which is limited by the amount to be reprogrammed to a particular project. DOD officials noted that reprogrammings requiring congressional approval are called \"above-threshold reprogrammings\" and those that do not are called \"below-threshold reprogrammings.\" The report highlights the importance of accurate cost estimates for MILCON projects, as these estimates are used to justify funding requests. The report also discusses the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, which outlines best practices for developing reliable cost estimates. The report found that DOD's current cost estimating guidance, the Unified Facilities Criteria, does not fully incorporate all the steps needed to produce reliable cost estimates. The report also discusses the challenges faced by DOD in managing MILCON projects, including cost overruns and the need for reprogramming.

Reliable project construction cost estimates are of great importance, since those estimates drive these appropriations. House Report 114-537 accompanying a proposed bill authorizing national defense activities for fiscal year 2017 included a provision for GAO to report on DOD's MILCON cost estimating. This report examines the extent to which (1) the active component obligated and expended the MILCON appropriations received during fiscal years 2005-2016, (2) the active component reprogrammed MILCON appropriations during fiscal years 2010 through 2016, and (3) DOD's MILCON cost estimates are reliable for selected projects and DOD's guidance for developing estimates fully incorporates the steps needed for developing reliable estimates. GAO analyzed the active components' MILCON execution data and reviewed DOD's guidance for cost estimating and compared it with the best practices identified in GAO's Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide . During fiscal years 2005 through 2016, Congress appropriated about $66 billion in military construction funds (MILCON) to the active duty Army, Navy, and Air Force (referred to as the active component) for projects. As of September 30, 2016, the active component had obligated all but about $5.1 billion and expended all but about $11 billion of those funds. Of the $5.1 billion remaining unobligated, about $4.6 billion was still available to be obligated because MILCON appropriations are generally available for new obligations for 5 years. According to Department of Defense (DOD) officials, available but unobligated amounts no longer needed may be either taken back by Congress or reprogrammed to other MILCON projects that the active component identifies as needing additional funding. During fiscal years 2010 through 2016, the active component reprogrammed about $1.6 billion in MILCON appropriations to fund emergency projects, projects that were authorized but did not receive specific appropriations, and projects needing additional funding. Of this amount, the Army reprogrammed about $789 million; the Navy, about $535 million; and the Air Force, about $295 million. DOD's guidance does not fully incorporate the steps needed for developing reliable estimates and the estimates for three projects that GAO reviewed were not reliable. Specifically, two of the three high-value projects GAO examined experienced a more than 30-percent increase from the initial cost estimates submitted to Congress. GAO determined that DOD cost estimators did not follow all the best practices associated with the four characteristics—comprehensive, well-documented, accurate, and credible—of a reliable estimate for these projects. GAO's Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide identifies 12 steps that, if used, are more likely to result in reliable and valid cost estimates. However, as shown below, DOD's construction guidance—the Unified Facilities Criteria—does not include all of these steps. Until DOD incorporates these steps, DOD and congressional decision-makers may not have reliable estimates to inform their decisions regarding appropriations and the oversight of projects. GAO recommends that DOD ensure that its cost estimating guidance fully incorporate the steps needed for developing reliable cost estimates. DOD partially concurred with GAO's recommendation and stated that it will issue revised cost guidance in fiscal year 2019 that more fully incorporates those steps that would benefit the military construction program."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6142}

They have standards set by the Education Department and the Higher Education Act. These standards cover communication, personnel, policies, procedures, reporting, and internal controls. \n\nFSA is also responsible for ongoing financial oversight, including reviewing annual financial statement audits to assess financial responsibility. Schools that don't meet standards are subject to additional oversight. They must submit annual compliance audits. The OIG is responsible for audit quality, and they review a sample each year. The OIG found quality issues in some audits, but can't comment on overall prevalence. \n\nThe report also discusses the certification process. When schools first apply, they get provisional certification for one year or denied. For recertification, they can get provisional or full or denied. Provisional is for new schools or those not fully compliant. Provisional schools can't open new campuses or programs without FSA approval. They have less substantive appeals process than fully certified schools. Also, recertified schools in provisional status are subject to more FSA oversight than fully certified schools. \n\nFSA uses various sources to assess a school's capability, including compliance audits, financial statements, accreditation, state authorization, and self-reported data. \n\nThe certification process involves multiple steps, including reviewing documents, accreditation, state authorization, financial statements, and self-reported data. \n\nThe report mentions that FSA has a denial rate of 11% for initial certification and 3% for recertification. \n\nThere's a part about the audit quality issues, like insufficient auditor training, schools hiring less experienced auditors to save costs, and the OIG's quality reviews. \n\nThey also talk about steps taken to improve audit quality, like training for auditors, guidance for schools on selecting auditors, and working groups to update guidance. \n\nThe summary needs to be one page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins. \n\nI need to condense all this information into a concise summary.", "answers": ["Education provided over $122 billion in grants, loans and work study funds to help students pay for college at about 6,000 schools in fiscal year 2017. Education is responsible for certifying that these schools are eligible for and capable of properly administering federal student aid funds. Schools are required to submit an annual compliance audit that provides information on schools' administrative capability, which Education considers in its school certification decisions. GAO was asked to review Education's process for certifying schools to receive federal student aid. This report examines (1) how Education certifies schools to administer federal student aid and how frequently schools are approved and denied certification; and (2) the role of compliance audits in the certification process and what, if any, steps Education has taken to address the quality of the audit information. GAO analyzed data on school certification outcomes for calendar years 2006-2017 (when GAO determined data were most reliable); reviewed data and reports summarizing Education's reviews of compliance audit quality for fiscal years 2006-2017; reviewed a non-generalizable sample of 21 school certification decisions from fiscal years 2015 and 2016, selected for a mix of decisions, school characteristics, and geographic regions; examined relevant federal laws, regulations, policy manuals and guidance; and interviewed Education officials. The Department of Education (Education) is responsible for evaluating a variety of information to determine whether a postsecondary school should be certified to administer federal student aid programs, and agency data show that it approves most schools that apply. Education procedures instruct regional office staff to review school policies, financial statements, and compliance audits prepared by independent auditors, among other things. Education can certify schools to participate in federal student aid programs for up to 6 years, or it can provisionally certify them for less time if it determines that increased oversight is needed—for example, when a school applies for certification for the first time or when it has met some but not all requirements to be fully certified. In calendar years 2006 through 2017, Education fully or provisionally approved most schools applying for initial or recertification to receive federal student aid (see figure). Note: Schools applying for certification for the first time and approved are placed in provisional certification. In deciding whether to certify schools, Education particularly relies on compliance audits for direct information about how well schools are administering federal student aid, and Education's offices of Federal Student Aid and Inspector General have taken steps to address audit quality. The Inspector General annually selects a sample of compliance audits for quality reviews based on risk factors, such as auditors previously cited for errors. In fiscal years 2006 through 2017, 59 percent of the 739 selected audits received failing scores. Audits that fail must be corrected; if not, the school generally must repay federal student aid covered by the audit. Because higher risk audits are selected for review, Inspector General officials said they cannot assess the overall prevalence of quality problems in compliance audits. These two Education offices have taken steps to improve audit quality. For example, the Inspector General offered additional training to auditors on its revised 2016 audit guide and provided guidance to schools on hiring an auditor, while Federal Student Aid created a working group to strengthen its procedures for addressing poor quality compliance audits. Education's efforts to address audit quality could help ensure that these audits provide reliable information for school certification decisions.

{"pred": " The report highlights the persistent and escalating threat of cybersecurity incidents affecting federal agencies and the information they hold. According to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 2018 report to Congress, there were 35,277 information security incidents reported to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) in fiscal year 2017. These incidents, which include web-based attacks, phishing attacks, and the loss or theft of computer equipment, pose serious risks to economic, national, and personal privacy and security. The report includes several notable examples, such as the 2018 indictment of nine Iranians for conducting a massive cybersecurity theft campaign on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which allegedly stole over 31 terabytes of documents and data from over 140 American universities, 30 U.S. companies, and 5 federal government agencies. In March 2018, a joint alert from DHS and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) stated that since at least March 2016, Russian government actors had targeted U.S. government entities and critical infrastructure sectors, including energy, nuclear, water, aviation, and critical manufacturing. In June 2015, the Office of Personnel Management reported that an intrusion into its systems had affected the personnel records of about 4.2 million current and former federal employees. Then, in July 2015, the agency reported that a separate but related incident had compromised its systems and the files related to background investigations for at least 21.5 million individuals. The report outlines the federal approach and strategy for securing information systems, which is prescribed by federal law and policy. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) sets requirements for effectively securing federal systems and information. In addition, the Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015 requires protecting federal networks through the use of federal intrusion prevention and detection capabilities. Further, Executive Order 13800, Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure, directs agencies to manage cybersecurity risks to the federal enterprise by, among other things, using the NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity. The report also discusses the federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015, which requires protecting federal networks and critical infrastructure sectors. The report outlines the federal government's approach and strategy for securing information systems, which is based on the Federal Information Security Modern", "answers": ["Federal agencies are dependent on information systems to carry out operations. The risks to these systems are increasing as security threats evolve and become more sophisticated. To reduce the risk of a successful cyberattack, agencies can deploy intrusion detection and prevention capabilities on their networks and systems. GAO first designated federal information security as a government-wide high-risk area in 1997. In 2015, GAO expanded this area to include protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information. Most recently, in September 2018, GAO updated the area to identify 10 critical actions that the federal government and other entities need to take to address major cybersecurity challenges. The federal approach and strategy for securing information systems is grounded in the provisions of the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 and Executive Order 13800. The act requires agencies to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide program to secure their information systems. The Executive Order, issued in May 2017, directs agencies to use the National Institute of Standards and Technology's cybersecurity framework to manage cybersecurity risks. The Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015 contained a provision for GAO to report on the effectiveness of the government's approach and strategy for securing its systems. GAO determined (1) the reported effectiveness of agencies' implementation of the government's approach and strategy; (2) the extent to which DHS and OMB have taken steps to facilitate the use of intrusion detection and prevention capabilities to secure federal systems; and (3) the extent to which agencies reported implementing capabilities to detect and prevent intrusions. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed OMB reports related to agencies' information security practices including OMB's annual report to Congress for fiscal year 2017. GAO also analyzed and summarized agency-reported security performance metrics and IG-reported information for the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies. In addition, GAO evaluated plans, reports, and other documents related to DHS intrusion detection and prevention programs, and interviewed OMB, DHS, and agency officials. The 23 civilian agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO Act) have often not effectively implemented the federal government's approach and strategy for securing information systems (see figure below). Until agencies more effectively implement the government's approach and strategy, federal systems will remain at risk. To illustrate: As required by Office of Management and Budget (OMB), inspectors general (IGs) evaluated the maturity of their agencies' information security programs using performance measures associated with the five core security functions—identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. The IGs at 17 of the 23 agencies reported that their agencies' programs were not effectively implemented. IGs also evaluated information security controls as part of the annual audit of their agencies' financial statements, identifying material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal controls for financial reporting at 17 of the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies. Chief information officers (CIOs) for 17 of the 23 agencies reported not meeting all elements of the government's cybersecurity cross-agency priority goal. The goal was intended to improve cybersecurity performance through, among other things, maintaining ongoing awareness of information security, vulnerabilities, and threats; and implementing technologies and processes that reduce malware risk. Executive Order 13800 directed OMB, in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), to assess and report on the sufficiency and appropriateness of federal agencies' processes for managing cybersecurity risks. Using performance measures for each of the five core security functions, OMB determined that 13 of the 23 agencies were managing overall enterprise risks, while the other 10 agencies were at risk. In assessing agency risk by core security function, OMB identified a few agencies to be at high risk (see figure at the top of next page). DHS and OMB facilitated the use of intrusion detection and prevention capabilities to secure federal agency systems, but further efforts remain. For example, in response to prior GAO recommendations, DHS had improved the capabilities of the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS), which is intended to detect and prevent malicious traffic from entering agencies' computer networks. However, the system still had limitations, such as not having the capability to scan encrypted traffic. The department was also in the process of enhancing the capabilities of federal agencies to automate network monitoring for malicious activity through its Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program. However, the program was running behind schedule and officials at most agencies indicated the need for additional training and guidance. Further, the Federal CIO issued a mandated report assessing agencies' intrusion detection and prevention capabilities, but the report did not address required information, such as the capability of NCPS to detect advanced persistent threats, and a cost/benefit comparison of capabilities to commercial technologies and tools. Selected agencies had not consistently implemented capabilities to detect and prevent intrusions into their computer networks. Specifically, the agencies told GAO that they had not fully implemented required actions for protecting email, cloud services, host-based systems, and network traffic from malicious activity. For example, 21 of 23 agencies had not, as of September 2018, sufficiently enhanced email protection through implementation of DHS' directive on enhanced email security. In addition, less than half of the agencies that use cloud services reported monitoring these services. Further, most of the selected 23 agencies had not fully implemented the tools and services available through the first two phases of DHS's CDM program. Until agencies more thoroughly implement capabilities to detect and prevent intrusions, federal systems and the information they process will be vulnerable to malicious threats. GAO is making two recommendations to DHS, to among other things, coordinate with agencies to identify additional needs for training and guidance. GAO is also making seven recommendations to OMB to, among other things, direct the Federal CIO to update the mandated report with required information, such as detecting advanced persistent threats. DHS concurred with GAO's recommendations. OMB did not indicate whether it concurred with the recommendations or not."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12551}

The report is about USAID's assistance to the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza through the ESF from 2015 to 2016. \n\nFirst, the main points are that USAID has obligated over $5 billion since 1993, with most of it through the ESF. The ESF is used for project assistance and debt relief. The assistance is aimed at building a democratic, stable, prosperous, and secure Palestinian society, which is in the interest of the Palestinians, the US, and Israel. \n\nThe report mentions that USAID implements most ESF programs, including private sector development, health, water, roads, local governance, civil society, rule of law, education, and youth development. \n\nThen there's a section about the antiterrorism policies, specifically Mission Order 21. The purpose is to ensure that assistance does not support terrorism. USAID has to vet PA creditors to ensure they are not associated with terrorism. \n\nThe report also talks about the amounts obligated and expended. As of March 31, 2018, about $544.1 million was obligated, with $350.6 million spent. The funds were used for direct payments to creditors, like the two Israeli fuel companies and the Bank of Palestine. \n\nThen there are the three development objectives: Economic Growth and Infrastructure, Investing in the Next Generation, and Governance and Civic Engagement. Each has specific projects and amounts. \n\nThe report discusses the vetting process for creditors, ensuring they are not linked to terrorism. It also mentions that USAID conducted vetting of creditors, checking against terrorist databases. \n\nThere's a part about the debt relief payments to creditors, and the vetting of creditors before payments. \n\nThe report also covers the compliance with legal requirements, including the requirement for assessments of the PA Ministry of Finance and Planning. \n\nThen there's a section about the assessments of the PA ministries, and the audits of the PA Ministry of Finance and Planning. \n\nThe report also includes the findings from the audits and assessments, such as weaknesses in the medical referral system and petroleum procurement systems. \n\nThe summary needs to be concise, one page, so I need to highlight the key points without going into too much detail. \n\nI should start by stating the purpose of the report, which is", "answers": ["Since 1993, the U.S. government has committed more than $5 billion in bilateral assistance to the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. According to the Department of State, this assistance to the Palestinians promotes U.S. economic and political foreign policy interests by supporting Middle East peace negotiations and financing economic stabilization programs. USAID is primarily responsible for administering ESF assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. Appropriations acts for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 included provisions for GAO to review the treatment, handling, and uses of funds provided through the ESF for assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. This report examines (1) the status of ESF assistance and projects provided to the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016, including project assistance and payments to PA creditors, and (2) the extent to which USAID conducted required vetting of PA creditors to ensure that this assistance would not support entities or individuals associated with terrorism and assessed PA ministries' capacity to use ESF assistance as intended. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations and USAID financial data, policies, procedures, and documents. GAO also interviewed USAID and State Department officials. As of March 2018, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) had allocated about $545 million of funding appropriated to the Economic Support Fund (ESF) for assistance in the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016. USAID obligated about $544 million (over 99 percent) and expended about $351 million (over 64 percent) of the total allocations. Project assistance accounted for approximately $399 million of the obligated funds, while payments to Palestinian Authority (PA) creditors accounted for $145 million (see figure). USAID's obligations for project assistance in the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 supported three development objectives—Economic Growth and Infrastructure ($239 million), Investing in the Next Generation ($107 million), and Governance and Civic Engagement (about $25 million). In fiscal years 2015 and 2016, USAID made payments directly to PA creditors—two Israeli fuel companies, to cover debts for petroleum purchases, and a local Palestinian bank, to pay off a line of credit used for PA medical referrals to six hospitals in the East Jerusalem Hospital network. USAID vetted PA creditors to ensure that the program assistance would not provide support to entities or individuals associated with terrorism and also conducted external assessments and financial audits of PA ministries of Health and Finance and Planning. USAID documentation showed that, as required, officials checked the vetting status of each PA creditor within 12 months before USAID signed its debt relief grant agreements with the PA. In addition, although USAID determined that it was not legally required to assess the PA Ministry of Health's medical referral services and the Ministry of Finance and Planning's petroleum procurement system, the agency commissioned external assessments of both ministries. These assessments found some weaknesses in both ministries' systems; however, USAID mission officials stated that these weaknesses did not affect USAID debt relief payments to the PA creditors. Nevertheless, USAID took additional steps to mitigate the identified weaknesses. For example, a USAID contractor worked with the Ministry of Health to update, revise, and approve guidelines for medical referrals. In addition, USAID commissioned financial audits of the debt relief grant agreements between USAID and the PA for direct payments to PA creditors in fiscal year 2015 and 2016.

{"pred": " The report discusses the U.S. government's efforts to improve small business access to capital, particularly in the context of the 2008 financial crisis. It highlights the importance of small businesses in job creation, especially during economic recoveries. The report notes that small businesses have historically contributed to net job growth, but during the 2007-2009 recession, they accounted for nearly 60% of net job losses. Despite this, small businesses have continued to be a significant source of new jobs, contributing about 63% of net new jobs from the end of the recession through FY2012. The report outlines several legislative actions taken during the 111th Congress to boost small business lending. For example, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) provided additional funding to the Small Business Administration (SBA) to subsidize fees and increase the loan guaranty percentage for the 7(a) program. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a $30 billion Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) to encourage lending to small businesses. The SBLF was designed to increase the availability of credit for small businesses by providing temporary authority to the Secretary of the Treasury to make capital investments in eligible institutions to increase the availability of credit for small businesses. The report also examines the implementation of the SBLF by the Department of the Treasury and discusses bills introduced during recent Congresses to amend the SBLF. For example, during the 112th Congress, S. 681, the Greater Accountability in the Lending Fund Act of 2011, would have, among other provisions, limited the program's authority to 15 years from enactment and prohibited TARP recipients from participating in the program. H.R. 2807, the Small Business Leg-Up Act of 2011, would have transferred any unobligated and repaid funds from the SBLF when its investment authority expired on September 27, 2011, to the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund \"to continue the program of making capital investments in eligible community development financial institutions in order to increase the availability of credit for small businesses.\" The report also provides data on the supply and demand for small business loans. It notes that the supply of small business loans has generally improved since the 2009, with some tightening in", "answers": ["Congressional interest in small business access to capital has increased in recent years because of concerns that small businesses might be prevented from accessing sufficient capital to enable them to start, continue, or expand operations and create jobs. Some have argued that the federal government should provide additional resources to assist small businesses. Others worry about the long-term adverse economic effects of spending programs that increase the federal deficit. They advocate business tax reduction, reform of financial credit market regulation, and federal fiscal restraint as the best means to assist small businesses and create jobs. Several laws were enacted during the 111th Congress to enhance small business access to capital. For example, P.L. 111-5, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), provided the Small Business Administration (SBA) an additional $730 million, including funding to temporarily subsidize SBA fees and increase the 7(a) loan guaranty program's maximum loan guaranty percentage to 90%. P.L. 111-240, the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a $30 billion Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF), in which $4.0 billion was issued, to encourage community banks with less than $10 billion in assets to increase their lending to small businesses. It also authorized a $1.5 billion State Small Business Credit Initiative to provide funding to participating states with small business capital access programs, numerous changes to the SBA's loan guaranty and contracting programs, funding to continue the SBA's fee subsidies and the 7(a) program's 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage through December 31, 2010, and about $12 billion in tax relief for small businesses. P.L. 111-322, the Continuing Appropriations and Surface Transportation Extensions Act, 2011, authorized the SBA to continue its fee subsidies and the 7(a) program's 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage through March 4, 2011, or until available funding was exhausted, which occurred on January 3, 2011. This report focuses on the SBLF. It opens with a discussion of the supply and demand for small business loans. The SBLF's advocates claimed the SBLF was needed to enhance the supply of small business loans. The report then examines other arguments presented both for and against the program. Advocates argued that the SBLF would increase lending to small businesses and, in turn, create jobs. Opponents contended that the SBLF could lose money, lacked sufficient oversight provisions, did not require lenders to increase their lending to small businesses, could serve as a vehicle for Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients to effectively refinance their TARP loans on more favorable terms with little or no resulting benefit for small businesses, and could encourage a failing lender to make even riskier loans to avoid higher dividend payments. The report concludes with an examination of the program's implementation and a discussion of bills introduced to amend the SBLF. For example, during the 112th Congress, S. 681, the Greater Accountability in the Lending Fund Act of 2011, would have limited the program's authority to 15 years from enactment and prohibited TARP recipients from participating in the program.

This goal is based on a Force Structure Assessment (FSA) conducted by the Navy in 2016, which analyzed the types and numbers of ships needed to support the Navy's portion of the national military strategy. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget includes funding for the procurement of 12 new ships, including one Gerald R.

The 355-ship force-level goal is the result of a Force Structure Assessment (FSA) conducted by the Navy in 2016. The Navy states that a new FSA is now underway as the successor to the 2016 FSA. This new FSA, Navy officials state, is to be completed by the end of 2019. Navy officials have suggested in their public remarks that this new FSA could change the 355-ship figure, the planned mix of ships, or both.

The program aims to support creditworthy businesses that cannot obtain conventional credit at reasonable terms. Key aspects include:\n\n1. **Program Overview**: The 7(a) program guarantees a portion of loans, typically between 50% and 85%, to small businesses. Lenders include banks and non-bank lenders, with the latter previously licensed by SBA. The SBA relies on lenders with delegated authority to approve loans and ensure borrower eligibility.\n\n2. **Eligibility and Credit Elsewhere Requirement**: To qualify, businesses must meet SBA size standards and the \"credit elsewhere\" requirement, which ensures that the desired credit is not available elsewhere at reasonable terms. The SBA has specific criteria for this, including loan maturity, collateral, and other factors. However, the SBA has faced challenges in ensuring lenders properly document their credit elsewhere determinations.\n\n3. **Documentation and Oversight**: In 2009, the SBA was found lacking guidance for lenders on how to document compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement, which hindered oversight. The SBA revised its procedures to require documentation of the factors that meet the credit elsewhere test. However, the documentation was not sufficient to address the underlying issues.\n\n4. **Lender Categories**: The 7(a) program includes regular, preferred lenders, and SBA Express. Each has different levels of autonomy and guarantee percentages. For example, SBA Express has a maximum guarantee of 50%, while other 7(a) loans have up to 85%.\n\n5. **Disparities in Credit Access**: The report highlights disparities in credit access among small businesses based on characteristics such as gender, minority status, and business age. Recent studies suggest that new businesses and women-owned businesses face challenges in obtaining conventional loans, which may put them at a disadvantage.\n\n6. **Compliance Issues**: The SBA found that many lenders were not properly documenting their credit elsewhere determinations. The main reasons were lack of proper internal controls and procedures, and lack of awareness of the credit elsewhere documentation requirement.\n\n7. **Recommendations**: The report recommends that the SBA require reviewers to consistently document their assessments of lenders' policies and practices, and that the SBA use its on-site and off-site reviews to routinely collect information on lenders' use of the credit elsewhere criteria, and that the SBA analyze the collected information to identify lenders at", "answers": ["SBA's 7(a) program is required to serve creditworthy small business borrowers who cannot obtain credit through a conventional lender at reasonable terms.

This report discusses, among other things, (1) how SBA monitors lenders' compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement, (2) the extent to which SBA evaluates trends in lender credit elsewhere practices, and (3) lenders' views on the credit elsewhere criteria for 7(a) loans. GAO analyzed SBA data on 7(a) loans approved for fiscal years 2007–2016, the latest available, and reviewed literature on small business lending; reviewed standard operating procedures, other guidance, and findings from SBA reviews performed in fiscal year 2016; and interviewed lender associations and a nonrepresentative sample of 7(a) lenders selected that concentrated on larger lenders. For its 7(a) loan program, the Small Business Administration (SBA) has largely delegated authority to lenders to make 7(a) loan determinations for those borrowers who cannot obtain conventional credit at reasonable terms elsewhere. To monitor lender compliance with the “credit elsewhere” requirement SBA primarily uses on-site reviews conducted by third-party contractors with SBA participation and oversight, and other reviews. According to SBA guidance, lenders making 7(a) loans must take steps to ensure and document that borrowers meet the program's credit elsewhere requirement. However, GAO noted a number of concerns with SBA's monitoring efforts. Specifically, GAO found the following: Over 40 percent (17 of 40) of the on-site lender reviews performed in fiscal year 2016 identified lender noncompliance with the requirement. On-site reviewers identified several factors, such as weakness in lenders' internal control processes that were the cause for lender noncompliance. Most on-site reviewers did not document their assessment of lenders' policies or procedures, because SBA does not require them to do so. As a result SBA does not have information that could help explain the high noncompliance rate. Federal internal control standards state that management should design control activities, including appropriate documentation, and use quality information to achieve the entity's objectives. Without better information on lenders' procedures for complying with the documentation requirement, SBA may be limited in its ability to promote compliance with requirements designed to help ensure that the 7(a) program reaches its target population. SBA does not routinely collect or analyze information on the criteria used by lenders for credit elsewhere justifications. SBA recently began collecting some information on lenders' use of the criteria, but this information is limited, and SBA does not analyze the information that it does collect to better understand lenders' practices. Federal internal control standards state that management should use quality information to achieve the entity's objectives. Without more robust information and analysis, SBA may be limited in its ability to understand how lenders are using the credit elsewhere criteria and identify patterns of use by certain lenders that place them at a higher risk of not reaching borrowers who cannot obtain credit from other sources at reasonable terms. In general, representatives from 8 of 11 lenders that GAO interviewed stated that SBA's credit elsewhere criteria are adequate for determining small business eligibility for the 7(a) program. These criteria help them target their lending to small businesses that would otherwise have difficulty obtaining conventional credit because they are often new businesses or have a shortage of collateral. However, they also said that other factors—such as lender policies and economic conditions—can affect their decisions to offer 7(a) loans. In January 2018, SBA issued revised guidance for the 7(a) program and has provided training on this new guidance to lenders and trade associations. Lenders told GAO they are still in the process of understanding the new requirements. GAO recommends that SBA (1) require its on-site reviewers to document their assessment of lenders' policies and procedures related to the credit elsewhere documentation requirement, (2) collect information on lenders' use of credit elsewhere criteria, and (3) analyze that information to identify trends. SBA generally agreed with the recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8215}
{"pred": " The report discusses the implementation and effectiveness of the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) and its subsequent modernization, the GPRA Modernization Act (GPRAMA), in the U.S. federal government. The GPRA was enacted in 193 to shift the focus of federal agencies from program activities and processes to the results to be achieved. It required agencies to develop long-term and annual goals, and to measure and report on progress towards those goals annually. The report highlights that while the GPRA laid a solid foundation for results-oriented management, the actual use of performance information by managers to make decisions aimed at improving results has not significantly increased over time. Despite increased availability of performance information, the report indicates that the use of this information in decision making remains unchanged in many agencies. In response to these findings, the report outlines a framework for agencies to better incorporate performance information into their decision making. The framework identifies five leading practices that can promote the use of performance information for policy and program decisions, and four ways agency managers can use performance information to make program decisions aimed at improving results. The report also highlights examples of how agencies have used performance information to improve results, such as the Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration using performance information to increase national safety belt usage from 11 percent in 1985 to 80 percent in 2004. The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA) was enacted to expand and enhance the statutory framework for federal performance management. The report finds that while the GPRA Modernization Act has led to some improvements in the use of performance information, there is still a lack of widespread application of these practices. The report also discusses the President's Management Agenda (PMA) and its related cross-agency priority (CAP) goals, which aim to improve data-driven decision making across the federal government. The report concludes that while there have been some positive developments, more actions are needed to ensure that performance information is effectively used in decision making at all levels of the federal government.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points. \n\nThe report starts by explaining the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA), which was passed by Congress to shift the focus of federal agencies from program activities and processes to the results they aim to achieve. The GPRA required agencies to develop long-term and annual goals,", "answers": ["To reform the federal government and make it more efficient and effective, agencies need to use data about program performance. The benefit of collecting performance information is only fully realized when it is used by managers to make decisions aimed at improving results. GAO was asked to review agencies' use of performance information. This report assesses, among other things, the extent to which: (1) 24 agencies' reported use of performance information and related leading practices has changed since 2013 and (2) the Executive Branch has taken actions to enhance the use of performance information. To address the first objective, GAO analyzed results from its 2017 survey of federal managers, and compared them to 2013 results. The survey covered a stratified random sample of 4,395 managers from the 24 Chief Financial Officers Act agencies. The survey had a 67 percent response rate and results can be generalized to the population of managers government-wide and at each agency. For the second objective, GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed staff from OMB and the PIC. Agencies' reported use of performance information to make decisions, and leading practices that can promote such use, generally has not improved since GAO's last survey of federal managers in 2013. However, GAO's survey results continue to point to certain practices that could help agencies improve managers' use of performance information. For example, as shown in the table below, GAO's survey found that managers whose programs were subject to data-driven reviews (regular reviews used to assess progress on select agency goals) to a greater extent reported statistically significantly greater use of performance information to make decisions. The Executive Branch has begun taking steps to improve the use of performance information within agencies and across the government. For example, In the President's Management Agenda and government-wide reform plan, released in March and June 2018 respectively, the administration acknowledged the need to do more, and announced a goal, among other actions, to improve the use of data in federal decision making. However, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and others responsible for this goal have yet to fully develop action plans to hold agencies accountable for achieving it. The Performance Improvement Council (PIC), which is chaired by OMB, has undertaken efforts to improve the use of performance information by, for example, creating a working group on agency performance reviews. But it has not yet taken a systematic approach to identify and share proven practices that led to, or challenges that may be hampering, increased use of performance information by managers. GAO's survey results identified agencies that may have insights into such practices and challenges. More fully developing action plans for the new goal, and identifying and sharing proven practices and challenges, could help ensure the Executive Branch takes further steps to improve the use of performance information by managers within agencies and across the federal government. To improve the use of performance information within agencies and across the federal government, GAO recommends that OMB work with (1) fellow goal leaders to more fully develop action plans for the new goal to improve the use of data and (2) the PIC to prioritize efforts to identify and share proven practices and challenges.

{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is about how federal agencies use telework to reduce office space and real estate costs. \n\nFirst, the Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 requires agencies to implement telework, including designating a Telework Managing Officer and incorporating telework into continuity plans. The Act doesn't mention space planning directly. OPM is tasked with assessing telework outcomes like real estate savings and submitting reports on telework goals. From 2012 to 2015, the percentage of eligible employees increased from 29% to 46%, showing telework's effectiveness.\n\nThen there's the OMB's Reduce the Footprint policy and the National Strategy for Efficient Real Property Use. These require agencies to improve real property use, control costs, and reduce holdings. Agencies must develop office space standards, reduction targets, and freeze the footprint. Telework is a key strategy to reduce space needs and increase efficiency. \n\nThe report mentions GSA's role in providing guidance and assistance on alternative workplace arrangements, including leveraging telework to reduce space. The GSA defines mobility as the ability to work both within and outside the agency worksite, including telework, desk-sharing, site work, and travel. \n\nThere are three scenarios for using telework in space planning: limited, no space changes; no space reduction but different allocation; and space reduction with different allocation. The third scenario allows up to 30% space reduction. \n\nThe report also discusses how agencies have used telework to reduce space. For example, the Department of Transportation aimed for a 10% reduction in new acquisitions due to compressed work schedules and telework. OPM data shows that telework participation increased significantly. \n\nChallenges include negotiating with collective bargaining units, managing organizational change, and measuring cost savings. Agencies also need more guidance on using telework for space planning. \n\nThe report concludes with two recommendations for GSA to develop guidance and complete a tool for assessing telework's impact on space. \n\nNow, I need to condense all this into a one-page summary. Let me structure it with an introduction, key findings, challenges, and recommendations. \n\nStart with the purpose of the report: assessing how 23 civilian CFO Act agencies use telework in space planning. Then mention the", "answers": ["Federal agencies are exploring ways to use telework as a tool to reduce the federal footprint and use space more efficiently. GAO was asked to examine the effects of telework on agencies' space-planning efforts. In this report, GAO reviewed: (1) how the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies reported using telework in office space planning; (2) the specific ways selected agencies and GSA used telework in their office space planning; and (3) any challenges the civilian CFO Act agencies faced in using telework in office space planning. GAO surveyed all 23 civilian CFO Act agencies, analyzed each agency's space-planning documents, and Real Property Efficiency Plans . GAO reviewed four agencies in greater detail based on analysis of telework data and other factors. For those four agencies GAO conducted site visits, interviewed officials, and analyzed agency documents. GAO also identified challenges agencies faced in using telework in space planning, based on survey results, agency documents, and interviews. The 23 civilian Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act agencies reported various ways of considering and using telework as a space-planning tool, by, for example, implementing desk-sharing for employees who telework in order to relinquish leased space, or increasing the number of staff working in an existing space without increasing its size. All of the 23 agencies discussed telework in the context of space planning and achieving greater space efficiencies in either their space-planning documents or Real Property Efficiency Plans . The agencies that used telework as a space-planning tool generally reported implementing smaller or unassigned workstations. Three of the four agencies GAO reviewed in greater detail––the General Services Administration (GSA); the Office of Justice Programs at the Department of Justice; the Centers for Disease Control at the Department of Health and Human Services; and the Bureau of the Fiscal Service at the Department of the Treasury––leveraged telework to reduce or use office space more efficiently. For example, GSA and the Office of Justice Programs used telework to accommodate more employees in a smaller office space as illustrated in figure 1 below. The Centers for Disease Control used telework to accommodate more employees in the same amount of space. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service reduced space without telework by reducing the size of individual workstations. The 23 civilian CFO Act agencies reported several challenges in using telework to reduce space including human capital issues, mission suitability, and measuring cost savings attributable to telework. About two-thirds of the agencies said they would find it helpful to have additional information, assistance, or resources in using telework as a space-planning tool. GSA provides guidance to improve space utilization. However, GAO found that GSA last developed relevant formal guidance in 2006. This information, and that on GSA's telework and space-planning websites, was neither specific nor detailed and therefore of limited assistance to agencies that would like to use telework as a space-planning tool. Additionally, GSA's space-planning tool—the Workplace Investment and Feasibility Tool, intended to help agencies quantify the benefits and costs of telework––remains under development after more than 4 years, and GSA officials have not decided whether to make the tool available to other federal agencies. As such, agencies reported that they lack adequate guidance to determine how best to reduce space or use it more efficiently, and how to assess the benefits and costs of using telework in space planning. GSA concurred with recommendations that GSA should: (1) develop guidance on how agencies can use telework as a strategic space-planning tool and make this guidance readily available and (2) complete and make the Workplace Investment and Feasibility Tool available to federal agencies for use in assessing the benefits and costs of telework."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6903}
{"pred": " The report highlights the growing cybersecurity risks facing federal agencies and critical infrastructure in the United States. It emphasizes that the complexity and diversity of IT systems, along with their interconnectedness with other networks, create a large attack surface and increase the likelihood of cyberattacks. The report discusses how advancements in technology, such as data analytics software and the Internet of Things (IoT), have made it easier to correlate data and track individuals across various databases and networks. These developments, combined with the increasing sophistication of cybercriminals and the extensive collection of personal information by both government and private entities, have significantly raised the risk of personal identifiable information (PII) being exposed and compromised. The report cites numerous examples of cyber incidents, including the 2018 ransomware attack on Atlanta, the Equifax data breach, and the indictment of Iranian hackers. These incidents demonstrate the potential for significant harm to national security, economic stability, and public health and safety. The report also outlines the four major cybersecurity challenges: (1) developing a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy and performing effective oversight, (2) securing federal systems and information, (3) protecting critical infrastructure, and (4) protecting privacy and sensitive data. To address these challenges, the report identifies 10 critical actions that the federal government and other entities need to take. These actions include developing and executing a more comprehensive federal cybersecurity strategy, improving the implementation of government-wide cybersecurity initiatives, enhancing the security of critical infrastructure, and prioritizing efforts to protect individual privacy and PII. The report also discusses the need for a more defined, coordinated, and comprehensive approach to planning and executing an overall strategy, which would likely lead to significant progress in furthering strategic goals and lessening persistent weaknesses. The report concludes that the federal government and the nation's critical infrastructure are highly vulnerable to a wide and evolving array of cyber-based threats. Securing these systems and data is vital to the nation's security, prosperity, and well-being. However, the security over these systems and data is inconsistent and urgent actions are needed to address ongoing cybersecurity and privacy challenges. In particular, the federal government needs to implement a more comprehensive cybersecurity strategy and improve its oversight, including maintaining a qualified cybersecurity workforce; address security weaknesses in federal systems and information and enhance cyber incident response efforts; bolster the protection of critical infrastructure; and prioritize efforts to protect individual privacy and PII.

The security of these systems and the data they use is vital to public confidence and national security, prosperity, and well-being. The risks to these systems are increasing as security threats evolve and become more sophisticated. GAO first designated information security as a government-wide high-risk area in 1997. This was expanded to include protecting cyber critical infrastructure in 2003 and protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information in 2015. This report provides an update to the information security high-risk area. To do so, GAO identified the actions the federal government and other entities need to take to address cybersecurity challenges. GAO primarily reviewed prior work issued since the start of fiscal year 2016 related to privacy, critical federal functions, and cybersecurity incidents, among other areas. GAO also reviewed recent cybersecurity policy and strategy documents, as well as information security industry reports of recent cyberattacks and security breaches. GAO has identified four major cybersecurity challenges and 10 critical actions that the federal government and other entities need to take to address them. GAO continues to designate information security as a government-wide high-risk area due to increasing cyber-based threats and the persistent nature of security vulnerabilities. GAO has made over 3,000 recommendations to agencies aimed at addressing cybersecurity shortcomings in each of these action areas, including protecting cyber critical infrastructure, managing the cybersecurity workforce, and responding to cybersecurity incidents. Although many recommendations have been addressed, about 1,000 have not yet been implemented.

{"pred": " The report discusses the establishment and challenges of the Office of Policy, Strategy, and Plans (PLCY) within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) following the passage of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) in December 2016. The NDAA elevated the head of PLCY to an Under Secretary, a position that was vacant as of June 5, 2018, with no nominee appointed by the President. This change was intended to equalize PLCY with other DHS management offices and headquarters components. While the NDAA authorizes the Secretary to establish a Deputy Under Secretary, the position has been filled by an acting deputy since March 2018. The report outlines the four categories of policy and strategy efforts that PLCY leads, conducts, or coordinates: statutory responsibilities, interagency efforts, Secretary's priorities, and self-initiated activities. It also highlights the five sub-offices of PLCY, each with a different focus area, and the current staffing issues, including vacancies and the lack of a clear staffing model. The NDAA also conferred new responsibilities on PLCY, such as the establishment of standards of reliability and validity for statistical data collected and analyzed by the department, and the maintenance of all immigration statistical information of U.S. The report also discusses the coordination of three key DHS strategic efforts: the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review (QHSR), the DHS Strategic Plan, and the Resource Planning Guidance. Despite these efforts, the report identifies several challenges that PLCY faces in its role of leading, conducting, and coordinating departmentwide policy development and implementation, and strategic planning. These challenges include the lack of clearly defined roles and responsibilities, the absence of consistent procedures and processes, and the absence of a clear delegation of authority from the Secretary. The report also highlights the importance of workforce planning and the need for systematic identification of workforce demand, capacity gaps, and strategies to address these gaps. The report concludes with four recommendations for the Secretary of Homeland Security to address these challenges and improve the effectiveness of PLCY in its strategic and policy roles.\n\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report.

It discusses the changes brought by the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) in December 2016. The main points are:\n\n1. The", "answers": ["GAO has designated DHS management as high risk because of challenges in building a cohesive department. PLCY supports cohesiveness by, among other things, coordinating departmentwide policy and strategy. In the past, however, questions have been raised about PLCY's efficacy. In December 2016, the NDAA codified PLCY's organizational structure, roles, and responsibilities. GAO was asked to evaluate PLCY's effectiveness. This report addresses the extent to which (1) DHS established an organizational structure and processes and procedures that position PLCY to be effective, (2) DHS and PLCY have ensured alignment of workforce with priorities, and (3) PLCY has engaged relevant component staff to help identify and respond to emerging needs. GAO analyzed the NDAA, documents describing specific responsibilities, and departmentwide policies and strategies. GAO also interviewed officials in PLCY and all eight operational components. According to our analysis and interviews with operational components, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans' (PLCY) organizational structure and efforts to lead and coordinate departmentwide and crosscutting strategies—a key organizational objective–have been effective. For example, PLCY's coordination efforts for a strategy and policy executive steering committee have been successful, particularly for strategies. However, PLCY has encountered challenges leading and coordinating efforts to develop, update, or harmonize policies that affect multiple DHS components. In large part, these challenges are because DHS does not have clearly-defined roles and responsibilities with accompanying processes and procedures to help PLCY lead and coordinate policy in a predictable, repeatable, and accountable manner. Until PLCY's roles and responsibilities for policy are more clearly defined and corresponding processes and procedures are in place, situations where the lack of clarity hampers PLCY's effectiveness in driving policy are likely to continue. Development of a delegation of authority, which involves reaching agreement about PLCY's roles and responsibilities and clearly documenting them, had been underway. However, it stalled due to changes in department leadership. As of May 2018, the effort had been revived, but it is not clear whether and when DHS will finalize it. PLCY does some workforce planning as part of its annual budgeting process, but does not systematically apply key principles of the DHS Workforce Planning Guide to help ensure that PLCY's workforce aligns with its and DHS's priorities and goals. According to PLCY officials, the nature of its mission requires a flexible staffing approach. As such, a portion of the staff functions as generalists who can be assigned to meet the needs of different situations, including unexpected changing priorities due to an emerging need. However, shifting short-term priorities requires tradeoffs, which may divert attention and resources from longer-term priorities. As of June 5, 2018, PLCY also had a number of vacancies in key leadership positions, which further limited attention to certain priorities. According to PLCY officials, PLCY recently began a review to identify the office's authorities in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (NDAA) and other statutes, compare these authorities to the current organization and operations, and address any workforce capacity gaps. Employing workforce planning principles—in particular, systematic identification of workforce demand, capacity gaps, and strategies to address them—consistent with the DHS Workforce Planning Guide could better position PLCY to use its workforce as effectively as possible under uncertain conditions and to communicate effectively with DHS leadership about tradeoffs. Officials from PLCY and DHS operational components praised existing mechanisms to coordinate and communicate at the senior level, especially about strategy, but component officials identified opportunities to better connect PLCY and component staff to improve communication flow about emerging policy and strategy needs. Among the ideas offered by component officials to enhance communication and collaboration were holding routine small-group meetings, creating forums for periodic knowledge sharing, and maintaining accurate and up-to-date contact information for all staff-level stakeholders. GAO is making four recommendations. DHS concurred with three recommendations, including that DHS finalize a delegation of authority defining PLCY's roles and responsibilities and develop corresponding processes and procedures. DHS did not concur with a recommendation to apply the DHS Workforce Planning Guide to identify and communicate workforce needs.

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report starts by explaining the Stafford Act, which allows states and tribes to request a presidential disaster declaration. FEMA coordinates the federal response and recovery, providing grants through programs like IA, Public Assistance, and Hazard Mitigation. The IA program has five different components, each helping survivors with various needs. Then there are six factors that FEMA considers when evaluating disaster requests. The report mentions that from 2008-2016, the President approved 57% of IA requests, with total obligations around $8.6 billion. It also talks about how FEMA regions use the RVAR template to ensure consistency in the evaluation process. However, there are challenges in the process, such as the subjective nature of the factors, lack of transparency, and difficulty in gathering information on the factors. Also, the report discusses the proposed revisions to the IA factors under the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act, aiming for more objective criteria and faster declarations. The report also mentions that FEMA regional offices do not consistently obtain and document information on all elements of the IA regulatory factors. \n\nSo, the summary needs to cover the main components of the Stafford Act, FEMA's role, the IA programs, the six factors, the data collection, the challenges faced, and the proposed changes.

When a state, U.S. territory, or tribe requests IA assistance through a federal disaster declaration, FEMA evaluates the request against regulatory factors, such as concentration of damages, and provides a recommendation to the President, who makes a final declaration decision. GAO was asked to review FEMA's IA declaration process. This report examines (1) the number of IA declaration requests received, declared, and denied, and IA actual obligations from calendar years 2008 through 2016, (2) the extent to which FEMA accounts for the regulatory factors when evaluating IA requests, and (3) any challenges FEMA regions and select states reported on the declaration process and factors and any FEMA actions to revise them. GAO reviewed FEMA's policies, IA declaration requests and obligation data, and FEMA's RVARs from July 2012 through December 2016, the most recent years for which data were available. GAO also reviewed proposed rulemaking comments and interviewed FEMA officials from all 10 regions and 11 state emergency management offices selected based on declaration requests and other factors. From calendar years 2008 through 2016, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Federal Emergency and Management Agency (FEMA) received 294 Individual Assistance (IA) declaration requests from states, U.S. territories, and tribes to help individuals meet their immediate needs after a disaster. Of these, the President declared 168 and denied 126 requests. Across the various types of IA declaration requests, severe storms (190) were the most common disaster type and drought (1) was among the least common. FEMA obligated about $8.6 billion in IA for disaster declarations during this period. GAO found that FEMA regions did not consistently obtain and document information on all elements of established IA regulatory factors when making IA recommendations to headquarters. Following a declaration request, a FEMA region is to prepare a Regional Administrator's Validation and Recommendation (RVAR)—a document designed to include data on each of the six IA regulatory factors for each declaration request as well as the regional administrator's recommendation. GAO reviewed all 81 RVARs from July 2012—the date FEMA began using the new RVAR template—through December 2016. GAO found that regions did not consistently obtain and document information for the elements required under the six regulatory factors (see table). For example, only 44 of the 81 RVARs documented all elements under the concentration of damage factor. By evaluating why regions are not completing all elements of each current IA regulatory factor, FEMA could identify whether any corrective steps are needed. Officials from the 10 FEMA regions and 11 states GAO interviewed, reported positive relationships with each other, but also cited various challenges with the IA declaration process and regulatory factors. For example, these officials told GAO that there are no established minimum thresholds for IA, making final determinations more subjective and the rationale behind denials unclear. However, as required by the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, FEMA has taken steps to revise the IA factors by issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking. According to FEMA, the proposed rule aims to provide more objective criteria, clarify the threshold for eligibility, and speed up the IA declaration process. As of April 2018, the proposed rule was still under consideration. According to FEMA officials, they plan to finalize the rule in late 2018; therefore, it is too early to know the extent to which it will address these challenges. GAO recommends that FEMA evaluate why regions are not completing the RVARs for each element of the current IA regulatory factors and take corrective steps, if necessary.

{"pred": " The U.S. Forest Service, a federal agency responsible for managing national forests and grasslands, conducting research, and collaborating with various stakeholders, faces significant internal control deficiencies in its budget execution processes. The report highlights that the Forest Service lacks adequate processes and related control activities to ensure that funds designated for specific purposes are used as intended, leading to potential misuse of appropriated funds. Key issues include the absence of a process to review unobligated no-year funds from prior years for continuing need, which increases the risk of non-compliance with the Antideficiency Act. Additionally, the agency has not developed a comprehensive system for administrative control of funds, resulting in decentralized operations and inconsistent application of financial controls across regions and stations. The Forest Service also failed to design and document control activities for fund transfers related to wildland fire suppression, which could lead to mismanagement of funds. The report also points out deficiencies in the management of reimbursable agreements, such as the lack of segregation of incompatible duties and insufficient review processes. These issues collectively increase the risk of non-compliance with laws and regulations, and could result in the misallocation of resources.

In fiscal years 2015 and 2016, the Forest Service received discretionary no-year appropriations of $5.1 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively. It is critical for the Forest Service to manage its budgetary resources efficiently and effectively. While the Forest Service had processes over certain of its budget execution activities, GAO found the following internal control deficiencies: Budgetary resources . The purpose statute requires that amounts designated in appropriations acts for specific purposes are used as designated. The Forest Service did not have an adequate process and related control activities to reasonably assure that amounts were used as designated. In fiscal year 2017, GAO issued a legal opinion that the Forest Service had failed to comply with the purpose statute with regard to a $65 million line-item appropriation specifically provided for the purpose of acquiring aircraft for the next-generation airtanker fleet. Further, the Forest Service lacked a process and related control activities to reasonably assure that unobligated no-year appropriation balances from prior years were reviewed for their continuing need; did not have a properly designed system for administrative control of funds, which keeps obligations and expenditures from exceeding limits authorized by law; and had not properly designed control activities for fund transfers to its Wildland Fire Management program. These deficiencies increase the risk that the Forest Service may make budget requests in excess of its needs. Reimbursable agreements . To carry out its mission, the Forest Service enters into reimbursable agreements with agencies within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), other federal agencies, state and local government agencies, and nongovernment entities. The Forest Service (1) did not have adequately described processes and related control activities in manuals and handbooks for its reimbursable agreement processes and (2) lacked control activities related to segregating incompatible duties performed by line officers and program managers. For example, line officers may be responsible for initiating cost sharing agreements, modifying cost settlement packages, and changing or canceling the related receivable, which represent incompatible duties. As a result, programs and resources may not be protected from waste, fraud, and mismanagement. Unliquidated obligations . The Forest Service's processes and control activities over the review and certification of unliquidated obligations were not properly designed to reasonably assure the best use of funds and that unliquidated obligations would be efficiently and effectively deobligated and made available for other program needs. Further, the current process, as designed, was inconsistent with USDA and Forest Service policy. In addition, the Forest Service's manuals and handbooks, which provide directives for the areas that GAO reviewed, had not been reviewed by management in accordance with the Forest Service's 5-year review policy. Further, standard operating procedures and desk guides prepared by staff to supplement the manuals and handbooks were not issued as directives and therefore were not considered official policy. This increases the risk that control activities may not be consistently performed across the agency. GAO is making 11 recommendations to improve processes and related internal control activities over the management of the Forest Service's budgetary resources, reimbursable receivables and collections, and its process for reviewing unliquidated obligations. The Forest Service generally agreed with the report and stated that it has made significant progress to address the report findings."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8760}

Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points.\n\nThe report starts by explaining the constitutional provision (Article II, Section 2) that requires the President to appoint officers with the Senate's advice and consent. It then goes into the purposes of the confirmation process: examining qualifications, influencing policy, and delaying for other matters. The report mentions that the Senate confirms a high percentage of nominations, especially for non-policy roles. It also talks about the volume of nominations—like 65k military and 2k civilian per Congress. Then there's the process: how nominations are sent to the Senate, referred to committees, the role of committees in investigations, hearings, and the various steps involved. The report also discusses the role of senatorial courtesy, the use of holds, and changes to the confirmation process over the years, like the 2013 and 2017 changes.\n\nSo the summary needs to cover the constitutional basis, the purposes of the process, the types of nominations, the confirmation process steps, the role of committees, senatorial courtesy, holds, and recent changes like the 2017 and 2019 reinterpretations of the cloture rule.\n\nI should structure the summary into sections: Introduction, Purposes of the Process, Types of Nominations, Confirmation Process, Role of Committees, Senatorial Courtesy, Holds, and Recent Changes. But since it's a one-page summary, maybe combine some sections.\n\nStart with the constitutional provision. Then explain the main purposes: examining qualifications, policy influence, and delaying for other issues. Then mention the volume of nominations and how the Senate handles them (en bloc, etc). Then the role of committees in investigations, hearings, and the process of gathering information (FBI, financial disclosures). Then senatorial courtesy, which affects certain positions. Then holds, which are used to delay or block nominations. Then the recent changes in 2017 and 2019, which reduced the post-cloture time to 2 hours for most nominations, and 30 hours for some. Also, the impact of these changes on the process, like faster confirmations, and the role of party leaders.\n\nI need to make sure to mention the high confirmation rate due to non-policy roles, the President's discretion, and", "answers": ["Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution provides that the President shall appoint officers of the United States \"by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate.\" This report describes the process by which the Senate provides advice and consent on presidential nominations, including receipt and referral of nominations, committee practices, and floor procedure. Committees play the central role in the process through investigations and hearings. Senate Rule XXXI provides that nominations shall be referred to appropriate committees \"unless otherwise ordered.\" Most nominations are referred, although a Senate standing order provides that some \"privileged\" nominations to specified positions will not be referred unless requested by a Senator. The Senate rule concerning committee jurisdictions (Rule XXV) broadly defines issue areas for committees, and the same jurisdictional statements generally apply to nominations as well as legislation. A committee often gathers information about a nominee either before or instead of a formal hearing. A committee considering a nomination has four options. It can report the nomination to the Senate favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation, or it can choose to take no action. It is more common for a committee to take no action on a nomination than to reject a nominee outright. The Senate handles executive business, which includes both nominations and treaties, separately from its legislative business. All nominations reported from committee are listed on the Executive Calendar, a separate document from the Calendar of Business, which lists pending bills and resolutions. Generally speaking, the majority leader schedules floor consideration of nominations on the Calendar. Nominations are considered in \"executive session,\" a parliamentary form of the Senate in session that has its own journal and, to some extent, its own rules of procedure. The Senate can call up a nomination expeditiously, because a motion to enter executive session to consider a specific nomination on the Calendar is not debatable. This motion requires a majority of Senators present and voting, a quorum being present, for approval. After a nomination has been called up, the question before the Senate is \"will the Senate advise and consent to this nomination?\" A majority of Senators voting is required to approve a nomination. However, Senate rules place no limit on how long a nomination may be debated, and ending consideration could require invoking cloture. On April 6, 2017, the Senate reinterpreted Rule XXII in order to allow cloture to be invoked on nominations to the Supreme Court by a majority of Senators voting. This expanded the results of similar actions taken by the Senate in November 2013, which changed the cloture vote requirement to a majority for nominations other than to the Supreme Court. After the 2013 decision, the number of nominations subjected to a cloture process increased. On April 3, 2019, the Senate reinterpreted Rule XXII again. The Senate reduced, from 30 hours to 2 hours, the maximum time nominations can be considered after cloture has been invoked. This change applied to all executive branch nominations except to high-level positions such as heads of departments, and it applied to all judicial nominations except to the Supreme Court and the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The full impact of this change is difficult to assess at this time, but it is likely to shorten the time between a cloture vote and a vote on the nomination. If Senators respond as they did to the last reinterpretation of the cloture rule, it might also increase the number of nominations subjected to a cloture process. Nominations that are pending when the Senate adjourns sine die at the end of a session or recesses for more than 30 days are returned to the President unless the Senate, by unanimous consent, waives the rule requiring their return (Senate Rule XXXI, clause 6). If a nomination is returned, and the President still desires Senate consideration, he must submit a new nomination."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5595}

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nFirst, the LHWCA is a workers' compensation program for maritime workers in the U.S. It's administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), but benefits are paid by private insurers or self-insured companies. The program covers injuries and illnesses related to work, providing medical and disability benefits, and survivors' benefits. In 2016, they paid around $1.41 billion. \n\nThe federal government has a limited role, covering federal employees and certain private workers. Most workers are covered by state laws. Texas is the only state without mandatory workers' comp. \n\nThe LHWCA was established in 1927 to cover longshore and harbor workers, who were previously not covered by state systems due to admiralty jurisdiction. The coverage was expanded in 1972 to include areas adjacent to navigable waters used for vessel activities. \n\nThere are exclusions for certain workers, like those in clerical roles, marina employees, suppliers, etc. The 2009 ARRA amendment added exclusions for recreational vessels over 65 feet. \n\nThe DOL has regulations for defining recreational vessels, which are based on USCG classifications.

Disability benefits are calculated based on pre-disability wage, with max and min based on NAWW. \n\nSurvivors' benefits are based on the deceased worker's wage. \n\nThe DOL authorizes insurance carriers and self-insured companies. \n\nThe Special Fund is used when the employer or insurance carrier can't pay, and it's funded by assessments on employers and insurance carriers. \n\nThe claims process involves the DOL, with possible appeals to the Benefits Review Board and courts. \n\nAlso, the report mentions that", "answers": ["The Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) is a federal workers' compensation program that covers certain private-sector maritime workers.

The LHWCA is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), and all benefit costs are paid by employers and their insurance carriers. In 2016, more than $1.4 billion in LHWCA benefits were paid to beneficiaries. Congress has extended the LHWCA provisions to cover workers outside of the maritime industry, such as overseas government contractors and civilian employees of military post exchanges. As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), persons who repair recreational vessels of any size were added to the LHWCA exemption list. In 2011, the DOL implemented this provision; since then, those regulations have proven controversial and numerous bills have been introduced to modify the regulatory definition to increase the number of workers exempted from the LHWCA. The LHWCA pays for all medical care associated with a covered injury or illness.

{"pred": " \n\nThe report provides an analysis of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) annual appropriations for Fiscal Year (FY) 2019, comparing the enacted FY2018 appropriations, the Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request, and the legislative measures developed by Congress in response. It outlines the process of appropriations for FY2019, starting with the Trump Administration's February 12, 2018, budget request, which included a $47.43 billion adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS, a slight decrease from FY2018's $47.72 billion. The report details the legislative process, including the Senate and House Appropriations Committee reports, the passage of a continuing resolution, and the eventual enactment of the FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-6). The report also discusses the structure of the DHS budget, including the five titles that categorize the department's components and the general provisions that affect the entire department. The report highlights the key components of the DHS budget, such as the Disaster Relief Fund, and the various discretionary and mandatory spending categories. It also provides a visual representation of the FY2019 requested funding in a new structure called the Common Appropriations Structure (CAS). The report includes detailed tables comparing the FY2018 enacted appropriations, the FY2019 requested appropriations, the FY2019 appropriations bills developed by the appropriations committees, and the final enacted annual appropriation in Division A of the FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-6). The report also provides additional resources and experts for further consultation on specific topics related to DHS appropriations. The report outlines the process of enactment of appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for FY2019, from the Administration's initial request, through committee action in the House and Senate, continuing appropriations (and their lapse), and enactment of the consolidated appropriations bill that contained DHS annual appropriation. The report discusses the various components of the DHS budget, including the discretionary and mandatory spending, offsetting collections, and the various allocations and adjustments to the discretionary spending caps under the Budget Control Act (BCA; P.L. 112-25). The report also includes a discussion of the discretionary budget authority for DHS for FY2019, including the $12 billion designated for the costs of major disasters, which was a significant increase from the request.", "answers": ["This report provides an overview and analysis of FY2019 appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The primary focus of this report is on congressional direction and funding provided to DHS through the appropriations process. It includes an Appendix with definitions of key budget terms used throughout the suite of Congressional Research Service reports on homeland security appropriations. It also directs the reader to other reports providing context for specific component appropriations. As part of an overall DHS budget that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimated to be $74.88 billion, the Trump Administration requested $47.43 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority through the appropriations process for DHS for FY2018. The request amounted to a $0.29 billion (0.6%) decrease from the $47.72 billion in annual appropriations enacted for FY2018 through the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141, Division F). The Administration also requested discretionary funding for DHS components that does not count against discretionary spending limits and is not reflected in the adjusted net discretionary budget authority total. The Administration requested an additional $6.65 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in disaster relief funding, as defined by the Budget Control Act (P.L. 112-25; BCA), and in the budget request for the Department of Defense (DOD), $165 million in Overseas Contingency Operations designated funding (OCO) from the Operations and Maintenance budget of the U.S. Navy. On June 21, 2018, the Senate Committee on Appropriations reported out S. 3109, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019, accompanied by S.Rept. 115-283. Committee-reported S. 3109 included $48.33 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for FY2019. This was $901 million (1.9%) above the level requested by the Administration, and $611 million (1.3%) above the enacted level for FY2018. The Senate committee-reported bill included the Administration-requested levels for disaster relief funding, and included the OCO funding in an appropriation to the Coast Guard, rather than as a transfer from the U.S. Navy. On July 26, 2018, the House Appropriations Committee marked up H.R. 6776, its version of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019. H.Rept. 115-948 was filed September 12, 2018. Committee-reported H.R. 6776 included $51.44 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority. The House committee-reported bill included the Administration-requested levels for disaster relief funding, but unlike S. 3109, did not include the OCO funding for the Coast Guard. As some of the annual appropriations for FY2019 remained unfinished, a consolidated appropriations bill that included a continuing resolution was passed by Congress and signed into law on September 28, 2018. The resolution, which covered DHS along with several other departments and agencies, continued funding at a rate of operations equal to FY2018 with some exceptions.

{"pred": " The report examines the legal and constitutional aspects of affirmative action in higher education, focusing on two distinct interpretations of the term. The first interpretation refers to mandatory race-conscious measures implemented by public universities to eliminate the remnants of state-imposed racial segregation. This includes the use of race in admissions decisions as a means to achieve a critical mass of underrepresented minorities, which is seen as essential to the educational mission of a modern university. The second interpretation of affirmative action involves voluntary race-conscious policies adopted by institutions to increase the representation of racial minorities in their student bodies. This includes the use of race as a factor in admissions decisions, a practice observed by many public and private colleges and universities. The report discusses how the federal courts have analyzed these two forms of affirmative action under the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of \"equal protection.\" The Supreme Court has made clear that a state that had a segregated system of education must eliminate all \"vestiges\" of that system, including through expressly race-conscious remedies. In its consequential 192 decision United States v. Fordice , the Court charted a three-step inquiry for assessing whether a state has fulfilled that constitutional obligation, examining whether a current policy is traceable to the de jure segregated system, has continued discriminatory effect, and can be modified or practicably eliminated consistent with sound educational policy. Outside this de jure context, affirmative action has come to refer to a different category of race-conscious policies. These involve what the Court once called the \"benign\" use of racial classifications —voluntary measures designed not directly to remedy past governmental discrimination, but to increase the representation of racial minorities previously excluded from various societal institutions. The report explains that the federal courts have come to subject voluntary \"affirmative action\" policies to a particularly searching form of review, known today as strict scrutiny. And they have so far upheld these policies under a single theory: that the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body uniquely justify some consideration of race when deciding how to assemble an incoming class. To rely on that diversity rationale, however, the Court now requires universities to articulate in concrete and precise terms what their diversity-related educational goals are and why they have chosen to pursue them. And even once those goals are established, a university must still show that its admissions policy achieves its diversity-related goals as precisely as possible, while ultimately \"treat[ing each applicant as an individual.\" The report also discusses the role of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in ensuring equal protection in higher education, including several avenues", "answers": ["When federal courts have analyzed and addressed \"affirmative action\" in higher education, they have done so in two distinct but related senses, both under the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of \"equal protection.\" The first has its roots in the original sense of \"affirmative action:\" the mandatory use of race by public education systems to eliminate the remnants of state-imposed racial segregation. Because state-sanctioned race segregation in public education violates the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, in certain cases involving a state's formerly de jure segregated public university system, a state's consideration of race in its higher education policies and practices may be an affirmative obligation. As the U.S. Supreme Court explained in its consequential 1992 decision United States v. Fordice, equal protection may require states that formerly maintained de jure segregated university systems to consider race for the purpose of eliminating all vestiges of their prior \"dual\" systems. Drawing upon its precedent addressing racially segregated public schools in the K-12 context, the Court established a three-part legal standard in Fordice for evaluating the sufficiency and effectiveness of a state's efforts in \"dismantl[ing]\" its formerly de jure segregated public university system. To that remedial end, mandatory race-conscious measures—in this de jure context—are not limited to admissions. Instead, remedies may also address policies and practices relating to academic programs, institutional missions, funding, and other aspects of public university operations. Outside this de jure context, \"affirmative action\" has come to refer to a different category of race-conscious policies. These involve what the Court at one time called the \"benign\" use of racial classifications—voluntary measures designed not to remedy past de jure discrimination, but to help racial minorities overcome the effects of their earlier exclusion. And for institutions of higher education, the Court has addressed one type of affirmative action policy in particular: the use of race as a factor in admissions decisions, a practice now widely observed by both public and private colleges and universities. The federal courts have come to subject these voluntary race-conscious policies—\"affirmative action\" in its perhaps more familiar sense—to a particularly searching form of review known as strict scrutiny. And even though this heightened judicial scrutiny has long been regarded as strict in theory but fatal in fact, the Court's review of race-conscious admissions policies in higher education has proved a notable exception, with the Court having twice upheld universities' use of race as one of many factors considered when assembling their incoming classes. The Court has long grappled with this seeming tension—between the strictness of its scrutiny and its approval of race-conscious admissions policies—beginning with its landmark 1978 decision in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke through its 2016 decision in Fisher v. University of Texas. Though the Equal Protection Clause generally concerns public universities and their constitutional obligations under the Fourteenth Amendment, federal statutory law also plays a role in ensuring equal protection in higher education. To that end, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits recipients of federal funding—including private colleges and universities—from, at a minimum, discriminating against students and applicants in a manner that would violate the Equal Protection Clause. Federal agencies, including the Departments of Justice and Education, investigate and administratively enforce institutions' compliance with Title VI."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12474}

The program requires states to reserve 15% of their VR allotment for these services, and states must identify all potentially eligible students. The report highlights that most states have expanded services for students with disabilities since WIOA's enactment in 2014, but many have not used all the reserved funds. It also notes that some agencies for the blind have not expanded services as much as other types of agencies. The report identifies challenges in identifying eligible students, coordinating with educational agencies, and using funds effectively. These challenges include unclear guidance on allowable expenditures, resource constraints, and differing legal requirements. The Department of Education (Education) has provided various forms of guidance and technical assistance, including webinars, conference calls, and presentations at conferences. However, without clear timeframes for additional information, states may miss opportunities to serve all eligible students.

GAO reviewed documents and funding data from Education, and federal laws and regulations; surveyed all 79 state VR agencies (74 responded); held discussion groups with representatives of 29 state VR agencies; and interviewed officials from Education and three states (Idaho, Illinois, and Maryland) GAO selected for variety in size and type of agencies, among other factors. Of the 74 state vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies that responded to GAO's survey, most reported expanding services to help students with disabilities transition from school to work as required under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), enacted in July 2014. Most state agencies reported serving more students and providing work-based learning experiences and other activities, referred to as pre-employment transition services (see figure). State VR agencies reported two key challenges with implementing pre-employment transition services for students as required by WIOA. Spending reserved funds : States reported spending about $357 million out of the $465 million reserved for these services in fiscal year 2016. Education officials said that states had difficulty determining what expenditures were allowable, and some state officials said they would like more detailed information from Education. Education officials said they plan to clarify guidance but have no timeframe for providing further information, which would help states to better plan their use of reserved funds. Finalizing interagency agreements : Fewer than half the state VR agencies that responded to GAO's survey (34 of 74) reported updating their interagency agreement with their state's educational agency. Interagency agreements can help promote collaboration by, for example, establishing roles and responsibilities of each agency. Although Education offers technical assistance on interagency agreements, without increased efforts to raise awareness about the importance of these agreements and provide assistance to states where needed, Education may miss opportunities to help state VR and educational agencies efficiently and effectively coordinate services. In addition, WIOA requires Education to highlight best state practices, and most VR agencies responding to GAO's survey (63 of 74) reported this would be useful. Education does not have a written plan or timeframe for identifying and disseminating best practices. As a result, Education may miss opportunities to help more students with disabilities successfully transition from school to work. GAO is recommending that Education (1) establish timeframes for providing additional information on allowable expenditures, (2) take additional steps to assist states that have not updated and finalized their interagency agreements, and (3) develop a written plan with specific timeframes and activities for identifying and disseminating best practices.

{"pred": " Medicare is a federal health insurance program established in 1965 under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, designed to provide health coverage for individuals aged 65 and older, as well as individuals with disabilities under 65. Administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Medicare consists of four parts: Part A (Hospital Insurance) covers inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing care, hospice care, and some home health services. Part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) covers physician services, outpatient services, and some home health and preventive services. Part C (Medicare Advantage) is a private plan option that covers all Parts A and B services, except hospice. Part D covers outpatient prescription drugs. Medicare is funded through a combination of payroll taxes, general revenues, and beneficiary premiums. The program serves approximately one in six Americans, with 61 million people in 2019, including 52 million aged and 9 million disabled. Medicare spending in 2019 is estimated to be about $772 billion, with $749 billion spent on benefits. Medicare is a mandatory spending program, not subject to the appropriations process. Medicare is expected to face increasing financial demands on the federal budget and on beneficiaries. The program has been a high-priority issue in the current Congress. Medicare has a significant impact on beneficiaries and other stakeholders as well as on the economy through its coverage of important health care benefits for the aged and disabled, the payment of premiums and other cost sharing by beneficiaries, its payments to providers who supply those health care services, and its interaction with other insurance coverage. Projections of future Medicare expenditures and funding indicate that the program will place increasing financial demands on the federal budget and on beneficiaries. In response to these concerns, Congress may consider a range of Medicare reform options, from making changes within the current structure, including modifying provider payments and revising existing oversight and regulatory mechanisms, to restructuring the entire program. The committees of jurisdiction for the mandatory spending (benefits) portion of Medicare are the Senate Committee on Finance, the House Committee on Ways and Means, and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations have jurisdiction over the discretionary spending used to administer and oversee the program.

It was established in 1965 under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide health insurance to individuals 65 and older, and has been expanded over the years to include permanently disabled individuals under the age of 65. Medicare, which consists of four parts (A-D), covers hospitalizations, physician services, prescription drugs, skilled nursing facility care, home health visits, and hospice care, among other services. Generally, individuals are eligible for Medicare if they or their spouse worked for at least 40 quarters in Medicare-covered employment, are 65 years old, and are a citizen or permanent resident of the United States. Individuals may also qualify for coverage if they are a younger person who cannot work because they have a medical condition that is expected to last at least one year or result in death, or have end-stage renal disease (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplant). The program is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and by private entities that contract with CMS to provide claims processing, auditing, and quality oversight services. In FY2019, the program is expected to cover approximately 61 million persons (52 million aged and 9 million disabled) at a total cost of about $772 billion. Spending under the program (except for a portion of administrative costs) is considered mandatory spending and is not subject to the annual appropriations process. Services provided under Parts A and B (also referred to as \"original\" or \"traditional\" Medicare) are generally paid directly by the government on a \"fee-for-service\" basis, using different prospective payment systems or fee schedules. Under Parts C and D, private insurers are paid a monthly \"capitated\" amount to provide enrollees with required benefits. Medicare is required to pay for all covered services provided to eligible persons, so long as specific criteria are met. Since 1965, the Medicare program has undergone considerable change. For example, during the 111th Congress, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148 and P.L. 111-152) made numerous changes to the Medicare program that modified provider reimbursements, provided incentives to increase the quality and efficiency of care, and enhanced certain Medicare benefits. In the 114th Congress, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA; P.L. 114-10) changed the method for calculating updates to Medicare payment rates to physicians and altered how physicians and other practitioners will be paid in the future. Projections of future Medicare expenditures and funding indicate that the program will place increasing financial demands on the federal budget and on beneficiaries. For example, the Hospital Insurance (Part A) trust fund is projected to become insolvent in 2026. Additionally, although the Supplementary Medical Insurance (Parts B and D) trust fund is financed in large part through federal general revenues and cannot become insolvent, associated spending growth is expected to put increasing strains on the country's competing spending priorities. As such, Medicare is expected to be a high-priority issue in the current Congress, and Congress may consider a variety of Medicare reform options ranging from further modifications of provider payment mechanisms to redesigning the entire program.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this detailed report on U.S. foreign aid. Let me start by reading through the report again to get the main points. \n\nThe report begins by stating that U.S. foreign aid is the largest part of the international affairs budget. It's been a key part of U.S. foreign policy for decades. There's been a lot of debate in Congress over the size, composition, and purpose of the program. \n\nAfter 9/11, the focus of foreign aid shifted. Global development became a third pillar of U.S. national security, along with defense and diplomacy. The Trump administration didn't explicitly mention development, but still saw aid as important for foreign policy goals. \n\nThe report addresses common questions about the program: its objectives, costs, organization, the role of Congress, and how it compares to other aid donors. It provides data up to FY2017, and mentions that the data might be revised as new info comes in. \n\nThe definition of foreign aid is under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, which includes any tangible or intangible item provided by the U.S. Government to a foreign country or international organization. \n\nThe scope of U.S. foreign aid has expanded beyond the traditional foreign operations and international food aid. Other agencies have adopted their own assistance programs, such as the Environmental Protection Agency providing water quality expertise. \n\nThe Department of Defense has funded various non-traditional aid programs, such as the Nunn-Lugar program to secure and eliminate weapons, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health have expanded their health programs in developing countries. \n\nThe report discusses the three main rationales for foreign aid: national security, commercial interests, and humanitarian concerns. \n\nThroughout the 70 years, there have been three key rationales for foreign assistance. National security has been the main theme. From rebuilding Europe after WWII under the Marshall Plan to the Cold War, U.S. aid programs were seen as a way to prevent communist influence and secure U.S. base rights or other support in the anti-Soviet struggle. After the Cold War, the focus shifted to regional issues like Middle East peace initiatives, transition to democracy in Eastern Europe and republics of the former Soviet Union, and international illicit drug production and trafficking in the Andes. Without an overarching security rationale, foreign aid budgets decreased in the 90s. However, since 9/11, foreign assistance has", "answers": ["Foreign assistance is the largest component of the international affairs budget and is viewed by many as an essential instrument of U.S. foreign policy. On the basis of national security, commercial, and humanitarian rationales, U.S. assistance flows through many federal agencies and supports myriad objectives. These include promoting economic growth, reducing poverty, improving governance, expanding access to health care and education, promoting stability in conflict regions, countering terrorism, promoting human rights, strengthening allies, and curbing illicit drug production and trafficking. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, foreign aid has increasingly been associated with national security policy. At the same time, many Americans and some Members of Congress view foreign aid as an expense that the United States cannot afford given current budget deficits. In FY2017, U.S. foreign assistance, defined broadly, totaled an estimated $49.87 billion, or 1.2% of total federal budget authority. About 44% of this assistance was for bilateral economic development programs, including political/strategic economic assistance; 35% for military aid and nonmilitary security assistance; 18% for humanitarian activities; and 4% to support the work of multilateral institutions. Assistance can take the form of cash transfers, equipment and commodities, infrastructure, or technical assistance, and, in recent decades, is provided almost exclusively on a grant rather than loan basis. Most U.S. aid is implemented by nongovernmental organizations rather than foreign governments. The United States is the largest foreign aid donor in the world, accounting for about 24% of total official development assistance from major donor governments in 2017 (the latest year for which these data are available). Key foreign assistance trends in the past decade include growth in development aid, particularly global health programs; increased security assistance directed toward U.S. allies in the anti-terrorism effort; and high levels of humanitarian assistance to address a range of crises. Adjusted for inflation, annual foreign assistance funding over the past decade was the highest it has been since the Marshall Plan in the years immediately following World War II. In FY2017, Afghanistan, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, and Egypt received the largest amounts of U.S. aid, reflecting long-standing aid commitments to Israel and Egypt, the strategic significance of Afghanistan and Iraq, and the strategic and humanitarian importance of Jordan as the crisis in neighboring Syria continues. The Near East region received 27% of aid allocated by country or region in FY2017, followed by Africa, at 25%, and South and Central Asia, at 15%. This was a significant shift from a decade prior, when Africa received 19% of aid and the Near East 34%, reflecting significant increases in HIV/AIDS-related programs concentrated in Africa between FY2007 and FY2017 and the drawdown of U.S. military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Military assistance to Iraq began to decline starting in FY2011, but growing concern about the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has reversed this trend.

{"pred": " The National Popular Vote (NPV) initiative, established in 2006, aims to achieve direct popular election of the President and Vice President without a constitutional amendment, by creating an interstate compact. This compact would require participating states to allocate their electoral votes to the candidate who wins the national popular vote. The initiative seeks to address perceived flaws in the Electoral College system, which currently allows less populous states to have more electoral votes per capita, and can result in a president being elected despite losing the popular vote. The report outlines the history of the Electoral College, its establishment by Article II, Section 1, and its subsequent revision by the Twelfth Amendment. It details the structure of the Electoral College, which assigns each state a number of electors equal to the sum of its U.S. Senate and House of Representatives delegations, and the District of Columbia is allocated three electors. The report discusses the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, which is an agreement among states to appoint electors pledged to the candidate who wins the national popular vote. The initiative has gained support in 14 states and the District of Columbia, which collectively hold 189 electoral votes. The report also examines the legal and constitutional challenges of the NPV initiative, particularly its status as an interstate compact under Article I, Section 10, Clause 3 of the Constitution. It highlights the debate over whether the compact would effectively change the constitutional structure of the presidential election process, and whether it violates the Constitution's Compact Clause. The report also covers the public's support for direct election, which has fluctuated over time, influenced by events like the 2000 and 2016 elections. It notes that while the NPV has not yet achieved its goal of 270 electoral votes, it has made progress, and the future of the initiative depends on further state adoptions and public awareness.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report about the National Popular Vote (NPV) initiative. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report explains that the NPV initiative was created in 2006 to promote an agreement among states to effectively establish direct popular election of the President and Vice President without a constitutional amendment. The current system is the Electoral College, which is unique in that it's an indirect election. The report goes into the history of the Electoral College, its establishment by Article II, Section 1, and its revision by the Twelfth", "answers": ["The National Popular Vote (NPV) initiative proposes an agreement among the states, an interstate compact that would effectively achieve direct popular election of the President and Vice President without a constitutional amendment. It relies on the Constitution's grant of authority to the states in Article II, Section 1 to appoint presidential electors \"in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct.... \" Any state that joins the NPV compact pledges that if the compact comes into effect, its legislature will award all the state's electoral votes to the presidential ticket that wins the most popular votes nationwide, regardless of who wins in that particular state. The compact would, however, come into effect only if its success has been assured; that is, only if states controlling a majority of electoral votes (270 or more) join the compact. By early May 2019, 14 states and the District of Columbia had joined the compact. After early momentum—eight states and the District of Columbia joined the NPV Compact between 2007 and 2011—the pace of state accessions slowed through 2018. Since then, four additional states joined, bringing the total number of electoral votes controlled by NPV member states to 189. During the same period, legislation to join the compact had been introduced during the current session in at least one chamber of the legislature in 14 additional states that control an additional 150 electors. The NPV initiative emerged following the presidential election of 2000, in which one ticket gained an electoral vote majority, winning the presidency, but received fewer popular votes than its opponents. NPV grew out of subsequent discussions among scholars and activists about how to avoid similar outcomes in the future and to achieve direct popular election. Proponents of NPV assert that it would guarantee the presidential candidates who win the most popular votes nationwide will always win the presidency; that it would end the inequities of the general ticket/winner-take-all system of awarding electoral votes; and that candidates would extend their focus beyond winning the \"battleground states,\" campaigning more widely and devoting greater attention to issues of concern to other parts of the country. They further assert that NPV would accomplish this while avoiding the exacting standards set for the proposal and ratification of constitutional amendments. Opponents argue that NPV would undermine the authority of states under the Constitution and the Founders' intention that presidential elections should be both national and federal contests; that it is an admitted \"end run\" around the Constitution that would circumvent the amendment process; and that it might actually lead to more disputed presidential elections characterized by politically contentious state recounts. The NPV has also been debated on legal grounds. Some observers maintain that it must be approved by Congress, because it is an interstate compact that would affect key provisions of constitutional presidential election procedures. NPV Inc., the organization managing the initiative's advocacy campaign, responds that congressional approval is not necessary because NPV concerns the appointment of electors, a subject that falls within state constitutional authority, and that the Supreme Court has previously rejected arguments that similar compacts would impair the rights of nonmember states. Other critics claim that NPV might violate the Voting Rights Act by diluting minority voter influence and avoiding the recently invalidated preclearance requirement for election procedure changes in covered jurisdictions.

{"pred": " \n\nThe report highlights the federal government's significant investment in information technology (IT), with a planned $96 billion for fiscal year 2018, the largest budget ever. However, despite this substantial funding, many federal IT projects have historically resulted in cost overruns, schedule delays, and minimal mission impact. The report outlines several high-profile failures, such as the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, which cost over $5 billion and was disbanded in 2010, and the Secure Border Initiative Network, which was terminated in 2011 after over $1 billion in spending. These failures are often attributed to poor project management, lack of clear requirements, and insufficient oversight. Additionally, the report points out that cybersecurity remains a critical issue, with many agencies still facing significant information security deficiencies despite significant spending on security-related activities. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA) aims to improve federal cybersecurity by clarifying government-wide responsibilities and promoting the use of automated security tools for continuous monitoring. The report also discusses the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA), which seeks to enhance the authority of federal CIOs, promote transparency, and improve the management of IT investments. Despite these legislative efforts, many recommendations remain unimplemented, underscoring the need for continued oversight and improvement in federal IT management and security.\n\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points. The main topic is the federal government's investment in IT, specifically the $96 billion budget for FY 2018. But the report also talks about the problems with these IT projects—failures, cost overruns, delays, and not meeting mission goals. There are several examples given, like the satellite system, the border initiative, and others that were canceled or had significant issues. The reasons for these failures are often related to poor management practices, lack of oversight, and not following best practices in IT acquisition. \n\nThen there's a part about cybersecurity measures. Even though agencies spent a lot on security, there are still vulnerabilities. The report mentions that some agencies didn't fully implement security recommendations. For example, the Department of Education didn't analyze privacy risks, and the OPM had not fully implemented recommendations from the US-CERT. The IRS had weaknesses in protecting taxpayer data. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, O", "answers": ["The federal government plans to invest almost $96 billion in IT in fiscal year 2018. Historically, IT investments have too often failed or contributed little to mission-related outcomes. Further, increasingly sophisticated threats and frequent cyber incidents underscore the need for effective information security. As a result, GAO added two areas to its high-risk list: IT security in 1997 and the management of IT acquisitions and operations in 2015. This statement summarizes agencies' progress in improving IT management and ensuring the security of federal IT. It is primarily based on GAO's prior reports issued between February 1997 and May 2018 (and an ongoing review) on (1) CIO responsibilities, (2) agency CIOs' involvement in approving IT contracts, (3) data center consolidation efforts, (4) the management of software licenses, and (5) compliance with cybersecurity requirements. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and federal agencies have taken steps to improve the management of information technology (IT) acquisitions and operations and ensure the security of federal IT through a series of initiatives. As of May 2018, agencies had fully implemented about 61 percent of the approximately 800 IT management-related recommendations that GAO made from fiscal years 2010 through 2015. Likewise, since 2010, agencies had implemented about 66 percent of the approximately 2,700 security-related recommendations as of May 2018. Even with this progress, significant actions remain to be completed. Chief Information Officer (CIO) responsibilities . Laws such as the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) and related guidance assigned 35 key IT management responsibilities to CIOs to help address longstanding challenges. However, in a draft report on CIO responsibilities, GAO's preliminary results suggest that none of the 24 selected agencies have policies that fully address the role of their CIO, as called for by federal laws and guidance. GAO intends to recommend that OMB and each of the selected 24 agencies take actions to improve the effectiveness of CIO's implementation of their responsibilities. IT contract approval . According to FITARA, covered agencies' CIOs are required to review and approve IT contracts. Nevertheless, in January 2018, GAO reported that most of the CIOs at 22 selected agencies were not adequately involved in reviewing billions of dollars of IT acquisitions. Consequently, GAO made 39 recommendations to improve CIO oversight over IT acquisitions. Consolidating data centers . OMB launched an initiative in 2010 to reduce data centers, which was codified and expanded in FITARA. According to agencies, data center consolidation and optimization efforts have resulted in approximately $3.9 billion of cost savings through 2018. Even so, additional work remains. GAO has made 160 recommendations to OMB and agencies to improve the reporting of related cost savings and to achieve optimization targets; however, as of May 2018, 80 of the recommendations have not been fully addressed. Managing software licenses . Effective management of software licenses can help avoid purchasing too many licenses that result in unused software. In May 2014, GAO reported that better management of licenses was needed to achieve savings, and made 135 recommendations to improve such management. Four years later, 78 of the recommendations remained open. Improving the security of federal IT systems . While the government has acted to protect federal information systems, agencies need to improve security programs, cyber capabilities, and the protection of personally identifiable information. Over the last several years, GAO has made about 2,700 recommendations to agencies aimed at improving the security of federal systems and information. These recommendations identified actions for agencies to take to strengthen their information security programs and technical controls over their computer networks and systems. As of May 2018, about 800 of the information security-related recommendations had not been implemented. From fiscal years 2010 through 2015, GAO made about 800 recommendations to OMB and federal agencies to address shortcomings in IT acquisitions and operations. Since 2010, GAO also made about 2,700 recommendations to federal agencies to improve the security of federal systems. These recommendations include those to improve the implementation of CIO responsibilities, the oversight of the data center consolidation initiative, software license management efforts, and the strength of security programs and technical controls.

It highlights the significant involvement of Congress in monitoring and challenging the Bush and Clinton administrations' responses to the conflict, which led to the Dayton Peace Agreement in 195. The U.S. played a crucial role in brokering the agreement, which established a complex political structure with two ethnoterritorial entities. The agreement's provisions, including the designation of Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs as constituent peoples, have led to a system that is prone to gridlock and dysfunction. The report outlines the historical context of Bosnia, its diverse population, and the impact of the war on its society and political structure. It discusses the ethnic divisions that have persisted since the war, the challenges of reforming the political system, and the influence of external powers like Russia, Turkey, and China. The U.S. has been a stakeholder in Bosnia's future due to its intervention in the conflict. The report also examines the geopolitical importance of Bosnia to U.S. interests in the Western Balkans and the potential for external actors to exploit the country's instability. It emphasizes the need for U.S. engagement with Bosnia to promote stability, counter corruption, and support democratic reforms.

The report discusses the Dayton system's issues, like gridlock and the need for reforms. \n\nIt also covers the political structure, the", "answers": ["Bosnia and Herzegovina (hereafter, \"Bosnia\") drew heavily on U.S. support after gaining independence from Yugoslavia in 1992. The United States helped end the Bosnian war (1992-1995), one of the most lethal conflicts in Europe since the Second World War, by leading NATO airstrikes against Bosnian Serb forces, brokering the Dayton Peace Agreement in 1995, and deploying 20,000 U.S. troops. Some Members of Congress became involved in policy debates over these measures, and Congress monitored and at times challenged the Bush and Clinton Administrations' response through numerous hearings, resolutions, and legislative proposals. Since 1995, the United States has been a major source of aid to Bosnia and firmly supports its territorial integrity. The United States also supports Bosnia's aspirations for NATO and European Union (EU) membership. Today, Bosnia faces serious challenges. Nearly 25 years after the Dayton Agreement, Bosnia continues to use part of the Agreement as its constitution, which divides the country into two ethnoterritorial entities. Critics charge that Bosnia's political system is too decentralized to enact the reforms required for NATO and EU membership. They also contend that the ethnic power-sharing arrangements and veto points embedded in numerous government bodies are sources of gridlock. Domestic and international courts have ruled against several aspects of Bosnia's constitution, yet the Bosnian government thus far has failed to implement these rulings. Since Bosnia's independence, its politics has been dominated by ethnic parties representing the country's three main groups: Bosniaks (Slavic Muslims), Croats, and Serbs. These parties have prospered under a system that critics charge lacks transparency and accountability. Critics also maintain that ethnic party leaders use divisive nationalist rhetoric to distract from serious issues affecting the country as a whole, including poverty, unemployment, and stalled political reforms. The Bosnian population exhibits low trust in political parties and the government, and disaffection toward the country's elite. U.S. and EU officials brokered several ultimately unsuccessful rounds of constitutional reform negotiations, and continue to call on Bosnia's leaders to implement reforms to make governance more efficient and effective, dismantle patronage networks, and bring Bosnia closer to EU and NATO membership. However, there is little consensus among the country's leaders on how the country should be reformed. Bosnian Serb leaders from the Serb-majority entity (Republika Srpska) have called for greater autonomy and even secession from Bosnia. Some Bosnian Croat leaders have called for partitioning Bosnia's other entity, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to create a separate Croat-majority entity. Bosniak leaders, by contrast, generally prefer a more centralized state. Many analysts caution that any move to partition the country could lead to renewed violence, while greater decentralization could make Bosnia's government less functional. U.S. policy has long been oriented toward preserving Bosnia's statehood. Bosnia's 2018 general elections largely returned to power the same entrenched ethnic parties. Of particular concern is the election of Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik to Bosnia's collective presidency. Dodik, a sharp critic of the United States and NATO, has periodically called for a referendum on Republika Srpska's secession. He is under U.S. sanctions for obstructing the Dayton Agreement. In addition to these internal challenges, U.S. and EU officials have expressed concern over external influence in the region. Russia reportedly relies on soft power, energy leverage, and \"spoiler\" tactics to influence Bosnia, particularly in the Serb-majority entity. Turkish soft power draws on Bosnia's Ottoman-era heritage and Turkey's shared religious tradition with Bosniaks. China is a more recent presence in the region, but its heavy investments and lending have prompted concern on both sides of the Atlantic. Policymakers have also expressed concern at the challenges posed by the return of Bosnians who fought with the Islamic State and Nusra Front in Syria and Iraq. Many observers contend that the United States remains a stakeholder in Bosnia's future because of its central role in resolving the conflict and shaping the postwar Bosnian state. Given the history of U.S. involvement in Bosnia, Bosnia's importance to regional stability in the Balkans, and concerns over Russian and Chinese influence in Bosnia, Members of Congress may be interested in monitoring how the country navigates its internal and external challenges. Congress may also consider future U.S. aid levels to Bosnia and the degree to which such assistance supports the long-standing U.S. policy objectives for Bosnia of territorial integrity, NATO and EU integration, energy security, and resilience against malign influence."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8598}
{"pred": " The report outlines the roles of the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the federal judiciary in the process of requesting and collecting restitution for victims of federal crimes. The DOJ, through its Criminal Division and the 94 U.S. Attorney's Offices (USAOs), is responsible for identifying victims, determining their losses, and negotiating restitution as part of plea agreements. The DOJ's Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section manages the Asset Forfeiture Program, which can be used to pay restitution. Financial Litigation Units (FLUs) within each USAO are tasked with collecting restitution from offenders, while asset forfeiture staff handle property seized due to criminal activities. The report highlights the importance of coordination between FLUs and asset forfeiture units to use forfeited assets to collect on unpaid restitution debts. The DOJ requires each USAO to have its own policies and procedures for debt collection, allowing flexibility based on local conditions. The DOJ's Executive Office of United States Attorneys (EOUSA) provides management assistance, guidance, training, and administrative support to USAOs. The judiciary, specifically the 94 federal district courts, orders restitution, receives payments from offenders, and disburses funds to victims. Probation officers prepare presentence investigation reports (PSRs) that include victim losses and offender financial information. The Judicial Conference has taken policy positions on restitution-related issues and supported legislative proposals to improve the process. The U.S. Sentencing Commission (USSC) establishes and enforces sentencing guidelines, including those for restitution. The report also discusses the process of restitution collection, including the use of the Treasury Offset Program (TOP) and wage garnishment. It notes that while DOJ has recommended practices for requesting, facilitating, and collecting restitution, there is a lack of performance measures and goals to assess the effectiveness of these practices. The DOJ's strategic plan includes improving debt collection, but without specific metrics, it is challenging to evaluate progress. The report further highlights the importance of restitution in the criminal justice system, emphasizing that it serves to hold offenders accountable and restore victims to their prior condition had the crime not occurred. However, many victims do not receive the full amount of restitution ordered due to offenders' inability to pay. The report concludes with three recommendations: (1) Judiciary officials should determine why USSC data on reasons restitution was not ordered is incomplete, and if necessary, take action to ensure all required information is included in the data records. (2) The Attorney General should develop and implement performance measures and goals for each USAO related to the collection of restitution.", "answers": ["One of the goals of federal criminal restitution is to restore victims of federal crimes to the position they occupied before the crime was committed by providing compensation. Various entities within the federal government are involved in the process of requesting, ordering, and collecting restitution for crime victims, including DOJ and the judiciary. The Justice for All Reauthorization Act of 2016 includes a provision for GAO to review the federal criminal restitution process for fiscal years 2014 through 2016. This report addresses, among other things: (1) the extent to which information is available on restitution requested by DOJ and ordered by courts; (2) the amount of restitution debt DOJ collected and the amount that remains outstanding; and, (3) the extent to which DOJ has conducted oversight on the collection of restitution. GAO analyzed laws, policies and procedures as well as USSC data on restitution orders and DOJ data on restitution collected from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. GAO also selected a non-generalizable sample of six federal judicial districts based on restitution collections and spoke with USAO officials and federal probation officers. Officials from selected U.S. Attorney's Offices (USAO) stated that they document requests for restitution in case files and employ other internal controls, such as the use of templates and forms, throughout the prosecution process to ensure that prosecutors request restitution as appropriate. GAO's analysis of U.S. Sentencing Commission (USSC) data—an agency within the judiciary—showed that information on restitution orders was available for 95 percent of all offenders sentenced from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. Specifically, 214,578 federal offenders were sentenced during this time period and restitution was ordered for 33,158, or 15 percent, of those offenders. Collectively, courts ordered these offenders to pay $33.9 billion in restitution. Most federal offenders sentenced during these years were sentenced for immigration or drug-related offenses. In interviews, USAO officials stated that these offenses do not typically have victims requiring restitution. GAO found that data on reasons why restitution was not ordered were incomplete for 5 percent of all offenders sentenced from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. Determining why data on restitution orders are incomplete may inform the judiciary of the cause of the incomplete data and any efforts needed to improve USSC data. GAO's analysis of Department of Justice (DOJ) data showed that USAOs collected $2.95 billion in restitution debt in fiscal years 2014 through 2016, see figure below. However, at the end of fiscal year 2016, $110 billion in previously ordered restitution remained outstanding, and USAOs identified $100 billion of that outstanding debt as uncollectible due to offenders' inability to pay. DOJ identified improving debt collection—including restitution—as a major management initiative in its 2014-2018 Strategic Plan. While DOJ is developing analytical tools to monitor the collection of restitution, it has not established performance measures or goals. Performance measures and goals would allow DOJ to gauge USAOs' success in collecting restitution and, by extension, the department's success in achieving a major management initiative. GAO is making three recommendations. GAO is making one to the judiciary to determine why data on restitution orders are incomplete. GAO is making two recommendations to DOJ, including one to implement performance measures and goals for the collection of restitution.

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nFirst, the report explains that FMAGs are authorized by Section 420 of the Stafford Act. They were established by regulation in 2001. The purpose is to provide federal assistance for fire suppression. The authority is delegated to FEMA's Regional Administrators. Once declared, FMAGs allow for equipment, personnel, and grants to state, local, and tribal governments for controlling, managing, and mitigating fires on public or private lands. There's a cost-sharing requirement where the state, local, and tribal governments cover 25% of the costs. \n\nThe report addresses common questions about FMAGs, including how they are requested, evaluated using thresholds, and the types of assistance provided. Requests can be made by a state governor when a fire is out of control and threatens a major disaster. Requests are submitted to FEMA's Regional Administrator, can be done by phone or written, with written confirmation within 14 days. Tribes can also request FMAGs under the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act. \n\nThere are two types of fire cost thresholds: individual and cumulative. These vary by state. For example, Pennsylvania has a higher cumulative threshold than Alaska. The process includes submitting forms and cost estimates. \n\nIf the request is denied, the state can appeal within 30 days. The appeal must include additional information. \n\nFunding for FMAGs comes from FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), which is a no-year account. The DRF has two categories: disaster relief costs for major disasters and base funding. The cost-share is 75% federal, 25% state/local/tribal. \n\nThe report also discusses the process for approving or denying the application, the time frame for submission, and the types of eligible expenses. \n\nAdditionally, it mentions that hazard mitigation grants are now available for FMAGs under the Disaster Recovery Reform Act. \n\nThere are some exceptions where FMAGs can be used for suppression on federal lands if the costs are not reimbursable by another federal statute. \n\nI need to make sure the summary covers the main points: what FMAGs are, how they're requested, the cost-sharing, the thresholds, the appeal process", "answers": ["Section 420 of the Robert T.

{"pred": " The Indian Health Service (IHS), established in 1955, provides health care to American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities, primarily in rural and isolated areas. IHS operates a network of hospitals, clinics, and health stations, and also funds tribally operated facilities. In fiscal year 2017, IHS allocated about $1.9 billion for health services provided by federally and tribally operated facilities. Federally operated IHS facilities, which received over 5.2 million outpatient visits and over 15,000 inpatient admissions in 2016, offer primary and emergency care, along with some specialty services. These facilities range from small health stations to larger hospitals, each with varying hours of operation and staffing levels. The IHS has 12 area offices that distribute funds, monitor operations, and provide guidance and technical assistance. Additionally, five human resources regional offices assist in recruitment and hiring. IHS facilities employ both federal civil service personnel and Commissioned Corps officers. IHS may pay higher salaries for certain federal civil service providers through the development and implementation of special pay tables, which specify the ranges of salaries that these certain providers can receive. Commissioned Corps officers follow the same process for applying for positions at IHS as federal civil service employees. However, the Commissioned Corps officers have different pay and allowances. IHS also supplements its workforce with temporary and long-term contracts with individual physicians or a medical staffing company. IHS data show significant vacancies for providers in the 8 areas with substantial direct care responsibilities. As of November 2017, the overall vacancy rate for physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, dentists, and pharmacists in these areas was 25 percent, ranging from 13 to 31 percent across the areas. However, variation in vacancy rates existed among provider types across IHS areas. For example, while the overall vacancy rate for physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, dentists, and physician assistants each exceeded 25 percent, the vacancy rate for pharmacists was less than 25 percent. In addition, for certain provider types in some areas, more than one-third of the positions were vacant. For example, although 29 percent of the total positions for physicians across these 8 areas were vacant, the vacancy rate ranged from 21 percent in the Oklahoma City area to 46 percent in the Bemidji and Billings areas.

According to IHS, AI/AN people born today have a life expectancy that is 5.5 years less than all races in the United States, and they die at higher rates than other Americans from preventable causes. The ability to recruit and retain a stable clinical workforce capable of providing quality and timely care is critical for IHS. GAO was asked to review provider vacancies at IHS. This report examines (1) IHS provider vacancies and challenges filling them; (2) strategies IHS has used to recruit and retain providers; and (3) strategies IHS has used to mitigate the negative effects of provider vacancies. GAO reviewed IHS human resources data for the provider positions that the agency tracks. GAO also reviewed policies, federal internal control standards, and legal authorities related to providers in federally operated IHS facilities. GAO interviewed IHS officials at the headquarters and area level and at selected facilities. GAO selected facilities based on variation in their number of direct care outpatient visits and inpatient hospital beds in 2014. Indian Health Service (IHS) data show sizeable vacancy rates for clinical care providers in the eight IHS geographic areas where the agency provides substantial direct care to American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) people. The overall vacancy rate for providers—physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, certified registered nurse anesthetists, certified nurse midwives, physician assistants, dentists, and pharmacists—was 25 percent, ranging from 13 to 31 percent across the areas. IHS officials told GAO that challenges to filling these vacancies include the rural location of many IHS facilities and insufficient housing for providers. Officials said long-standing vacancies have a negative effect on patient access, quality of care, and employee morale. IHS uses multiple strategies to recruit and retain providers, including offering increased salaries for certain positions, but it still faces challenges matching local market salaries. IHS also offers other financial incentives, and has made some housing available when possible. In addition, IHS uses strategies, such as contracting with temporary providers, to maintain patient access to services and reduce provider burnout. Officials said these temporary providers are more costly than salaried employees and can interrupt patients' continuity of care. However, IHS lacks agency-wide information on the costs and number of temporary providers used at its facilities, which impedes IHS officials' ability to target its resources to address gaps in provider staffing and ensure access to health services across IHS facilities. GAO recommends that IHS obtain, on an agency-wide basis, information on temporary provider contractors, including their associated cost and number of full-time equivalents, and use this information to inform decisions about resource allocation and provider staffing.

{"pred": " The report discusses the current state of the U.S. Navy's attack submarine fleet, highlighting both its capabilities and the challenges it faces. The Navy currently operates 51 attack submarines, including 33 Los Angeles class, 3 Seawolf class, and 15 Virginia class submarines, with some homeported overseas. The report emphasizes the importance of submarine safety, particularly in light of the tragic loss of the USS Thresher in 1963, which led to the establishment of the SUBSAFE program. This program ensures that submarines meet strict safety standards, and since its inception, no SUBSAFE-certified submarine has been lost. However, the report also points out that the Navy has experienced significant maintenance delays and idle time for its attack submarines, which have resulted in substantial operating and support costs. Between fiscal years 2008 and 2018, attack submarines incurred 10,363 days of idle time and maintenance delays, with 8,472 days (82%) attributed to depot maintenance delays. The delays in completing depot maintenance are the primary cause of the lost time. Additionally, the Navy has been unable to begin maintenance when public shipyards are at full capacity, forcing submarines to idle pierside. The report estimates that the Navy has spent over $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2018 constant dollars on attack submarines sitting idle while waiting to enter shipyards for maintenance. The Navy has started to address workforce shortages and facilities needs at the public shipyards. These efforts are important steps, but they will require several years of sustained management attention to achieve results. The report also highlights the need for the Navy to conduct a comprehensive business case analysis to inform maintenance workload allocation between public and private shipyards. This analysis would help the Navy better assess private shipyard capacity to perform attack submarine maintenance and incorporate a complete accounting of all costs, benefits, and risks, including the large operating and support costs of having attack submarines idle, the qualitative benefits associated with providing additional availability to the combatant commanders, and the potential for additional work at private shipyards to reduce schedule risk to submarine construction programs by allowing the yards to build and maintain a stable shipyard workforce. The report concludes that without addressing these challenges, the Navy will not achieve the full benefit of its investment in attack submarines, and it risks continued expenditure of operating and support funding to crew, maintain, and support attack submarines that provide no operational capability because they are delayed in getting into and out of maintenance. The Secretary of", "answers": ["According to the Navy, its 51 attack submarines provide the United States an asymmetric advantage to gather intelligence undetected, attack enemy targets, and insert special forces, among others. These capabilities make attack submarines some of the most–requested assets by the global combatant commanders. GAO was asked to review the readiness of the Navy's attack submarine force. This report discusses the extent to which the Navy (1) has experienced maintenance delays in its attack submarine fleet and costs associated with any delays; and (2) has addressed any challenges and developed mitigation plans for any maintenance delays. GAO analyzed readiness information from fiscal years 2008-2018, operating and support costs, maintenance performance, and other data; visited attack submarines and squadrons; and interviewed public and private shipyard and fleet officials. This is a public version of a classified report issued in October 2018. Information the Department of Defense deemed classified or sensitive, such as attack submarine force structure requirements and detailed data on attack submarine maintenance delays, has been omitted. The Navy has been unable to begin or complete the vast majority of its attack submarine maintenance periods on time resulting in significant maintenance delays and operating and support cost expenditures. GAO's analysis of Navy maintenance data shows that between fiscal year 2008 and 2018, attack submarines have incurred 10,363 days of idle time and maintenance delays as a result of delays in getting into and out of the shipyards. For example, the Navy originally scheduled the USS Boise to enter a shipyard for an extended maintenance period in 2013 but, due to heavy shipyard workload, the Navy delayed the start of the maintenance period. In June 2016, the USS Boise could no longer conduct normal operations and the boat has remained idle, pierside for over two years since then waiting to enter a shipyard (see figure). GAO estimated that since fiscal year 2008 the Navy has spent more than $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2018 constant dollars to support attack submarines that provide no operational capability—those sitting idle while waiting to enter the shipyards, and those delayed in completing their maintenance at the shipyards. The Navy has started to address challenges related to workforce shortages and facilities needs at the public shipyards. However, it has not effectively allocated maintenance periods among public shipyards and private shipyards that may also be available to help minimize attack submarine idle time. GAO's analysis found that while the public shipyards have operated above capacity for the past several years, attack submarine maintenance delays are getting longer and idle time is increasing. The Navy may have options to mitigate this idle time and maintenance delays by leveraging private shipyard capacity for repair work. But the Navy has not completed a comprehensive business case analysis as recommended by Department of Defense guidelines to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards. Navy leadership has acknowledged that they need to be more proactive in leveraging potential private shipyard repair capacity. Without addressing this challenge, the Navy risks continued expenditure of operating and support funding to crew, maintain, and support attack submarines that provide no operational capability because they are delayed in getting into and out of maintenance. GAO recommends that the Navy conduct a business case analysis to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards.

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report is from a government agency, probably the Congressional Research Service (CRS), and it's about the Aegis ballistic missile defense program. The main issue for Congress is whether to approve, reject, or modify the DOD's acquisition strategies and funding levels for the Aegis BMD program. The summary needs to be concise, so I should identify the purpose, key components, and the issues Congress is considering.\n\nFirst, the Aegis system is part of the Navy's ship combat systems. Originally designed for anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, it's been updated over time. The report explains how Aegis ships can be modified to conduct BMD operations by adding interceptors like SM-3, SM-2 Block IV, and SM-6. There are different variants of the Aegis BMD system, each with varying capabilities. The system has been used in various tests, including intercepting a satellite.\n\nThe report also discusses the strategic and budgetary context, including the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) and the role of allied countries like Japan, South Korea, Australia, Spain, and Norway. Japan is actively modifying its Aegis destroyers to be BMD-capable, and plans to add more Aegis Ashore systems.\n\nThe Aegis BMD system is being tested for intercepting ICBMs, with the SM-3 Block IIA interceptor. The report mentions that the SM-3 Block IIA is being developed, and the DOD plans to test this capability in 2020. There are concerns about the operational implications of having fewer BMD-capable ships than required, and the burden on the Navy's fleet. Also, the issue of burden sharing with allies, and the potential for new technologies like lasers or railguns to reduce the need for BMD interceptors.\n\nThe report also touches on the technical risks and testing issues in the Aegis BMD program, as highlighted by the DOT&E report. The MDA is working on improving the testing processes and gathering more reliable data.\n\nCongress is considering the FY2019 funding requests for the program, and the summary should mention the potential issues like funding accuracy, required vs available ships, burden sharing, and the impact of new technologies", "answers": ["The Aegis ballistic missile defense (BMD) program, which is carried out by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and the Navy, gives Navy Aegis cruisers and destroyers a capability for conducting BMD operations. Under the FY2020 budget submission, the number of BMD-capable Navy Aegis ships is projected to increase from 38 at the end of FY2018 to 59 at the end of FY2024. BMD-capable Aegis ships operate in European waters to defend Europe from potential ballistic missile attacks from countries such as Iran, and in in the Western Pacific and the Persian Gulf to provide regional defense against potential ballistic missile attacks from countries such as North Korea and Iran. The Aegis BMD program is funded mostly through MDA's budget. The Navy's budget provides additional funding for BMD-related efforts. MDA's proposed FY2020 budget requests a total of $1,784.2 million (i.e., about $1.8 billion) in procurement and research and development funding for Aegis BMD efforts, including funding for two Aegis Ashore sites in Poland and Romania. MDA's budget also includes operations and maintenance (O&M) and military construction (MilCon) funding for the Aegis BMD program. Issues for Congress regarding the Aegis BMD program include the following: whether to approve, reject, or modify MDA's FY2020 funding procurement and research and development funding requests for the program; required numbers of BMD-capable Aegis ships versus available numbers of BMD-capable Aegis ships; the burden that BMD operations may be placing on the Navy's fleet of Aegis ships, and whether there are alternative ways to perform BMD missions now performed by U.S. Navy Aegis ships, such as establishing more Aegis Ashore sites; burden sharing—how allied contributions to regional BMD capabilities and operations compare to U.S. naval contributions to overseas regional BMD capabilities and operations; whether to convert the Aegis test facility in Hawaii into an operational land-based Aegis BMD site; the potential for ship-based lasers, electromagnetic railguns (EMRGs), and hypervelocity projectiles (HVPs) to contribute in coming years to Navy terminal-phase BMD operations and the impact this might eventually have on required numbers of ship-based BMD interceptor missiles; and technical risk and test and evaluation issues in the Aegis BMD program."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6599}

Since the 1990s, Congress has enacted restrictions regarding the use of certain appropriated funds to promote U.S. tobacco exports. GAO was asked to review the implementation of these restrictions. This report examines (1) guidance select U.S. agencies have issued to implement these restrictions, (2) whether overseas officials from select U.S. agencies were aware of the restrictions and guidance, and (3) select U.S. agencies' implementation of the guidance overseas. GAO reviewed U.S. laws, agency guidance, and internal communications; analyzed Commerce data; and interviewed agency officials in Washington, D.C. and in 24 offices across 11 overseas posts in 9 countries. GAO selected these countries based on criteria that included U.S. tobacco export totals, smoking rates, and geographic dispersion. Congress has restricted the use of certain appropriated funding to promote tobacco exports and the Departments of State (State), Commerce (Commerce), and Agriculture (USDA) have issued interagency guidance through the cable system that they rely on to implement these restrictions. State collaborates with these and other agencies to periodically update this cable. The cable informs officials about the types of actions they should take—such as providing routine business facilitation services to all U.S. companies—and the types of actions they should not take—such as attending events sponsored by tobacco companies. Most, but not all, officials overseas that GAO interviewed were aware of the restrictions and received some guidance concerning the restrictions. However, GAO found that some officials did not recall receiving the interagency guidance cable. In addition, State and USDA's current training materials do not address the restrictions. Federal internal control standards state that appropriate training is essential to an organization's operational success. Thus, providing officials overseas with training about the funding restrictions and related guidance would help to ensure that officials are aware of the restrictions. U.S. officials overseas have implemented restrictions on promoting tobacco, but some officials said that the interagency guidance lacks clarity. Officials said that they have not promoted tobacco by, for example, attending events sponsored solely by tobacco companies. However, officials identified three areas of the guidance that are unclear: (1) attendance at events not sponsored by U.S. tobacco companies but attended by representatives of these companies; (2) the types of services officials can provide tobacco companies; and (3) the description of tobacco products, such as whether component parts for electronic cigarettes are included. Federal standards for internal control state that management should clearly document internal controls in policies and guidance to prevent officials from failing to achieve an objective or address a risk. By providing more specific guidance, the agencies would help ensure that officials consistently implement the funding restrictions on promoting tobacco. GAO recommends that (1) State and USDA include information about the funding restrictions and guidance in training materials for relevant employees and (2) State, in consultation with Commerce and USDA, assess and update the interagency guidance cable, as needed, on promoting tobacco in light of questions raised by officials at posts overseas.

The main issue is that they didn't properly document reviews of providers' clinical care when concerns were raised. From October 2013 to March 2017, five VA medical centers had 148 providers reviewed, but they couldn't show documentation for almost half of those reviews. Specifically, they lacked documentation for FPPEs for cause for 26 providers and retrospective reviews for 8 providers. Also, some reviews weren't conducted at all. The VA didn't have policies requiring documentation for all reviews, and there was inadequate oversight. \n\nThen there's the part about reporting providers to the National Practitioner Data Base (NPDB) and state licensing boards. Only one of nine required providers was reported, and none were reported to state boards. The reasons were that officials didn't know the policies or misinterpreted them, and the networks didn't oversee the reporting. This led to providers with deficiencies being able to work elsewhere, which is a problem because they could harm veterans.\n\nThe recommendations from the report are that the VA should require documentation of all reviews, set timeliness requirements, and strengthen oversight by networks.

The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care.

{"pred": " The Congressional Review Act (CRA) is a legislative tool that allows Congress to review and potentially overturn certain types of federal agency actions. Enacted in 1996 as part of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, the CRA enables Congress to consider legislation to disapprove agency actions that fall under the statutory category of \"rules.\" The CRA requires agencies to report the issuance of \"rules\" to Congress and provides Congress with special procedures to consider legislation to overturn those rules. A joint resolution of disapproval will become effective once both houses of Congress pass a joint resolution and it is signed by the President, or if Congress overrides the President's veto. For an agency's action to be eligible for review under the CRA, it must qualify as a \"rule\" as defined by the APA. The CRA's definition of \"rule\" is broader than the category of rules that are subject to the Administrative Procedure Act's (APA) notice-and-comment requirements. Thus, some agency actions, such as guidance documents, that are not subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures may still be considered rules under the CRA and thus could be overturned using the CRA's procedures. The 115th Congress used the CRA to pass, for the first time, a resolution of disapproval overturning an agency guidance document that had not been promulgated through notice-and-comment procedures. The resolution was signed into law by the President on May 21, 2018. In all of the previous instances in which the CRA was used to overturn agency actions, the disapproved actions were regulations that had been adopted through APA rulemaking processes. Congress's use of the CRA in this instance raised questions about the scope of the CRA and Congress's ability to use the CRA to overturn agency actions that were not promulgated through APA notice-and-comment procedures. Under the CRA, the expedited procedures for considering legislation to overturn rules become available only when agencies submit their rules to Congress. In many cases in which agencies take actions that meet the legal definition of a \"rule\" but have not gone through notice-and-comment procedures, however, agencies fail to submit those rules. Thus, questions have arisen about how Members can use the CRA's procedures to overturn agency actions when an agency does not submit the action to Congress.

The CRA generally adopts a broad definition of the word \"rule\" from the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), defining a rule as \"the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or describing the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of an agency.\" The CRA, however, provides three exceptions to this broad definition: any rule of particular applicability, including a rule that approves or prescribes for the future rates, wages, prices, services, or allowances therefor, corporate or financial structures, reorganizations, mergers, or acquisitions thereof, or accounting practices or disclosures bearing on any of the foregoing; any rule relating to agency management or personnel; or any rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice that does not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties. The class of rules the CRA covers is broader than the category of rules that are subject to the APA's notice-and-comment requirements. As such, some agency actions, such as guidance documents, that are not subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures may still be considered rules under the CRA and thus could be overturned using the CRA's procedures. The effect of Congress disapproving a rule that is not subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking may be subject to debate, given that such rules are generally viewed to lack any legal effect in the first place. Nonetheless, the CRA does encompass some such rules, as highlighted by the recent enactment of a CRA resolution overturning a bulletin from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that was not subject to the notice-and-comment procedures. Even if an agency action falls under the CRA's definition of \"rule,\" however, the expedited procedures for considering legislation to overturn the rule only become available when the agency submits the rule to Congress. In many cases in which agencies take actions that fall under the scope of a \"rule\" but have not gone through notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures, agencies fail to submit those rules. Thus, questions have arisen as to how Members can avail themselves of the CRA's special fast-track procedures if the agency has not submitted the action to Congress. To protect its prerogative to review agency rules under the CRA, Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) have developed an ad hoc process in which Members can request that GAO provide a formal legal opinion on whether a particular agency action qualifies as a rule under the CRA. If GAO concludes that the action in question falls within the CRA's definition of \"rule,\" Congress has treated the publication of the GAO opinion in the Congressional Record as constructive submission of the rule. In other words, an affirmative opinion from GAO can allow Congress to use the CRA procedures to consider legislation overturning an agency action despite the agency not submitting that action to Congress."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12318}
{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is about the VA's challenges in aligning its services and real property with the needs of veterans. \n\nFirst, the report mentions geographic shifts in the veterans' population, changes in healthcare delivery (like moving from inpatient to outpatient care), aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement. These factors are affecting the VA's ability to adjust their facilities. For example, the shift to outpatient care means that inpatient facilities might become underutilized, which is hard and costly to modernize. There are a lot of old buildings that are vacant or underused, and some are historic, making it hard to demolish or renovate. \n\nThen, the VA has issues with their facility alignment efforts because they haven't consistently engaged stakeholders. Stakeholders like veterans, local officials, etc., often see changes as against their interests, leading to adversarial relationships. The VA agreed with recommendations to improve stakeholder communication but hasn't fully implemented them yet.\n\nNext, the report talks about two planning processes: SCIP and VAIP. SCIP has limitations like subjective narratives, long timeframes, and limited access to information. For example, the time between when planning officials start developing SCIP narratives and when they are notified of funding has been 17-23 months. This makes it hard for local officials to know if their projects will be funded. The VA plans to release scoring results for minor projects earlier, but no timeline yet.\n\nThen, the VAIP process creates facility master plans assuming all future care is provided by VA facilities. But this isn't accurate because VA also purchases care from non-VA providers. The Office of Management and Budget's acquisition guidance says that investments in major capital assets should be made only if no alternative private sector source can support the function at a lower cost. The VA has discontinued the VAIP facility master plans while pursuing a national realignment strategy, planning to adjust future plans to include care in the community opportunities.\n\nThe report also compares the VA's situation to the DOD's BRAC process. The BRAC process had specific goals, criteria, cost estimates, organizational structure, common analysis framework, and oversight mechanisms. The VA could benefit from adopting similar elements in their realignment efforts.\n\nSo, the summary needs to capture these key points: the challenges VA faces (geographic shifts, healthcare", "answers": ["VA operates one of the largest health care systems in the United States, utilizing more than 6,000 federally owned and 1,500 leased buildings. DOD has repeatedly applied the BRAC process to reduce the amount of unneeded property that it owns and leases and to save billions of dollars that could be applied to higher priority defense needs. This statement is based on GAO's April 2017 report related to VA facility alignment ( GAO-17-349 ) and numerous GAO reports related to the BRAC process as summarized in a June 2011 testimony ( GAO-11-704T ) and a March 2012 testimony ( GAO-12-513T ). This statement addresses (1) the factors that affect VA's facility alignment and the extent to which VA's capital-planning process facilitates the alignment of facilities with the veterans' population, and (2) the key elements and challenges affecting DOD and the Commission in BRAC 2005. Detailed information on our scope and methodologies for this work can be found in these published products, cited throughout this testimony. Geographic shifts in the veterans' population, changes in health care delivery, aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement affect the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) efforts to align its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. For example, a shift over time from inpatient to outpatient care will likely result in underutilized space once used for inpatient care. Further, the historic status of some VA facilities adds to the complexity of converting or disposing of them. In such instances, it is often difficult and costly for VA to modernize, renovate, and retrofit these older facilities. GAO reported that two of the planning processes VA uses to align its facilities—VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) and the VA Integrated Planning (VAIP)—have limitations that undermine VA's efforts to achieve its goals. Specifically: VA relies on the SCIP process to plan and prioritize capital projects, but VA routinely asks its facility planners to submit their next year's planned project narratives before knowing if their previous submissions have been funded. The overlapping budget cycle, which is outside of VA's control, combined with other SCIP limitations—including subjective narratives, long time frames, and restricted access to information—make it difficult for VA to rely on SCIP to accurately identify the capital necessary to address its service and infrastructure gaps. VA concurred that it needs to address SCIP limitations that are within its control, as GAO recommended; VA has made some progress in implementing the recommendation has made some progress in implementing the recommendation.\\ The VAIP process is estimated to cost $108 million and to produce market-level service delivery plans and facility master plans. However, the VAIP master plans incorrectly assume that all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities without considering alternatives, such as purchasing care from the community. GAO recommended that VA consider discontinuing the VAIP facility master plans pending an assessment of their value as a facility-planning tool. VA agreed with the recommendation and is implementing it while pursuing a national realignment strategy.. Key elements of the Department of Defense's (DOD) 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process could benefit VA's asset and infrastructure review. The key elements included: (1) establishing goals for the process, (2) developing criteria for evaluating closures and realignments, and (3) establishing an organizational structure to develop closure and realignment options. GAO identified key challenges that affected DOD's implementation of BRAC 2005 and the results achieved; these challenges would need to be addressed if VA is to successfully apply the process. These challenges included: (1) large, complex recommendations required sustained senior leadership's attention and a high level of coordination among many stakeholders, and (2) the large number of actions that depend on each other for successful implementation. In the April 2017 report, GAO made recommendations related to capital planning and stakeholder involvement. VA concurred with the recommendations to the extent that they were within its control and has started making improvements."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2561}
{"pred": " The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has faced significant challenges in modernizing its financial management systems, which have been designated as high risk due to internal control and financial management deficiencies. To address these issues, DHS initiated a decentralized approach to upgrade or replace legacy systems, evaluating options including federal Shared Service Providers (SSPs). The TRIO project, involving the Coast Guard, DNDO, and TSA, focused on migrating their financial systems to a modern solution provided by IBC. The project aimed to implement a shared services solution, but faced various challenges, including delays in implementation dates. The project was initially planned to go-live in fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively, but the planned dates were not viable, leading to a 1-year delay. The project's risk management processes were not fully aligned with best practices, increasing the risk of selecting a suboptimal solution. The project's implementation was delayed due to various issues, such as IBC's capacity and experience for migrating large agencies, and the complexity of the requirements. The project's implementation was delayed due to the lack of reliable cost and schedule information, and the absence of thresholds for management involvement. The project's challenges raised concerns about the extent to which objectives will be achieved as planned. Plans for the TRIO project as of May 2017 involve significant changes, such as moving away from IBC and a 2-year delay in completing Coast Guard and TSA’s migration to a modernized solution. The report highlights that DHS did not fully adhere to best practices in both the alternatives analysis and the risk management processes, which increases the risk that the financial management system modernization project will not provide reasonable assurance of achieving its mission objectives. The report recommends that DHS improve its processes and guidance to ensure that future alternatives analyses follow AOA best practices and reflect the four characteristics of a reliable, high-quality AOA process.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report about the DHS's TRIO project. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points.\n\nThe report talks about how DHS has had issues with internal controls and financial management systems since 2003, leading to a high-risk designation.

They had a timeline with key events, but faced challenges in risk management. The report", "answers": ["To help address long-standing financial management system deficiencies, DHS initiated its TRIO project, which has focused on migrating three of its components to a modernized financial management system provided by IBC, an OMB-designated, federal SSP. House Report Number 3128 included a provision for GAO to assess the risks of DHS using IBC in connection with its modernization efforts. This report examines (1) the extent to which DHS and the TRIO components followed best practices in analyzing alternatives, and the key factors, metrics, and processes used in their choice of a modernized financial management system; (2) the extent to which DHS managed the risks of using IBC for its TRIO project consistent with risk management best practices; and (3) the key factors and challenges that have impacted the TRIO project and DHS's plans for completing remaining key priorities. GAO interviewed key officials, reviewed relevant documents, and determined whether DHS followed best practices identified by GAO as necessary characteristics of a reliable, high-quality AOA process and other risk management best practices. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) TRIO project represents a key effort to address long-standing financial management system deficiencies. During 2012 and 2013, the TRIO components—U.S. Coast Guard (Coast Guard), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO)—each completed an alternatives analysis (AA) to determine a preferred alternative for modernizing its financial management system. GAO found that DNDO's AA substantially met the four characteristics—well-documented, comprehensive, unbiased, and credible—that GAO previously identified for a reliable, high-quality analysis of alternatives (AOA) process. However, Coast Guard's and TSA's AAs did not fully or substantially meet three of these characteristics, and DHS guidance for conducting AAs did not substantially incorporate certain best practices, such as identifying significant risks and mitigation strategies and performing an independent review to help validate the AOA process. Based on these analyses and other factors, the TRIO components determined that migrating to a federal shared service provider (SSP) represented the best alternative, and in 2014, DHS selected the Department of the Interior's Interior Business Center (IBC) as the federal SSP for the project. However, because Coast Guard's and TSA's AAs did not fully or substantially reflect all of the characteristics noted above, they are at increased risk that the alternative selected may not achieve mission needs. DHS also did not fully follow best practices for managing project risks related to its use of IBC on the TRIO project. Specifically, DHS followed three of seven risk management best practices, such as determining risk sources and categories and establishing a risk management strategy. However, it did not fully follow four best practices for defining risk parameters, identifying risks, developing risk mitigation plans, and implementing these plans largely because its guidance did not sufficiently address these best practices. For example, although DHS created joint teams with IBC and provided additional resources to IBC to help address risk mitigation concerns, it did not always develop sufficiently detailed risk mitigation plans that also included contingency plans for selected critical risks. As a result, although IBC's capacity and experience for migrating large agencies the size of Coast Guard and TSA was identified as a risk in July 2014, a contingency plan working group to address this concern was not established until January 2017. By not fully following risk management best practices, DHS is at increased risk that potential problems may not be identified or properly mitigated. DHS, IBC, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and other federal oversight agencies identified various challenges that have impacted the TRIO project and contributed to a 2-year delay in the implementation of Coast Guard's and TSA's modernized solutions. These challenges include the lack of sufficient resources, aggressive schedule, complex requirements, increased costs, and project management and communication concerns. To help address these challenges, DHS and IBC established review teams and have taken other steps to assess potential mitigating steps. In May 2017, DHS determined that migrating the solution from IBC to a DHS data center represented the best option and initiated discovery efforts to further assess this as its path forward for the TRIO project. GAO recommends that DHS more fully follow best practices for conducting an AOA process and managing risks.

{"pred": " The report discusses the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), a U.S. government initiative aimed at combating tax evasion by U.S. persons holding investments in offshore accounts. FATCA requires foreign financial institutions (FFIs) to report more detailed information to IRS about their U.S. customers annually. These provisions are important developments in efforts to combat tax evasion by U.S. persons holding investments in offshore accounts. FATCA generally requires certain taxpayers to report foreign financial accounts and other specified foreign financial assets whose aggregate value exceeds specified thresholds to IRS on Form 8938. These taxpayers must report these assets and income generated from such assets to IRS with their tax return on Form 28938. These thresholds vary by filing status—such as single or married filing jointly—and by domestic or foreign residency. FATCA also promotes third-party reporting of foreign financial assets by requiring a withholding agent to withhold 30 percent on certain payments to an FFI unless the FFI or the jurisdiction in which the FFI is located has entered into an agreement with the United States to report certain account information of their U.S. customers. Under such an agreement, participating FFIs report detailed information to IRS annually about accounts held by their U.S. customers using IRS IRS. The report provides an overview of the FATCA program, which requires FFIs to report more detailed information to IRS about their U.S. customers annually. The report outlines the key provisions of FATCA, including the requirement for certain taxpayers to report foreign financial accounts and other specified foreign financial assets whose aggregate value exceeds specified thresholds to IRS on Form 8938. These thresholds vary by filing status—such as single or married filing jointly—and by domestic or foreign residency. The report discusses the implementation of FATCA, including the two intergovernmental agreements (IGAs)—Model 1 and Model 2—that facilitate the effective and efficient implementation of FATCA by removing partner jurisdictions' legal impediments to comply with FATCA reporting requirements, and reducing burdens on FFIs located in partner jurisdictions. The report highlights the challenges in implementing FATCA, such as the lack of accurate Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TINs) from U.S. persons, which makes it difficult for IRS to match information reported by FFIs to individual taxpayers. The report discusses the impact of FATCA on U.S. persons living abroad, including reduced access to foreign financial services, denial of employment and promotion opportunities, and difficulties in obtaining Social Security Numbers (SSNs). The report also discusses the challenges faced by the", "answers": ["Concerns over efforts by U.S. taxpayers to use offshore accounts to hide income or evade taxes contributed to the passage of FATCA in 2010, which sought to create greater transparency and accountability over offshore assets held by U.S. taxpayers. House Report 114-624 included a provision for GAO to evaluate FATCA implementation and determine the effects of FATCA on U.S. citizens living abroad. GAO—among other things—(1) assessed IRS's efforts to use FATCA-related information to improve taxpayer compliance; (2) examined the extent to which Treasury administers overlapping reporting requirements on financial assets held overseas; and (3) examined the effects of FATCA implementation unique to U.S. persons living abroad. GAO reviewed applicable documentation; analyzed tax data; and interviewed officials from IRS, other federal agencies and organizations, selected tax practitioners, and more than 20 U.S. persons living overseas. Data quality and management issues have limited the effectiveness of the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) efforts to improve taxpayer compliance using foreign financial asset data collected under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). Specifically, IRS has had difficulties matching the information reported by foreign financial institutions (FFI) with U.S. taxpayers' tax filings due to missing or inaccurate Taxpayer Identification Numbers provided by FFIs. Further, IRS lacks access to consistent and complete data on foreign financial assets and other data reported in tax filings by U.S. persons, in part, because some IRS databases do not store foreign asset data reported from paper filings. IRS has also stopped pursuing a comprehensive plan to leverage FATCA data to improve taxpayer compliance because, according to IRS officials, IRS moved away from updating broad strategy documents to focus on individual compliance campaigns. Ensuring access to consistent and complete data collected from U.S. persons—and employing a plan to leverage such data—would help IRS better leverage such campaigns and increase taxpayer compliance. Due to overlapping statutory reporting requirements, IRS and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)—both within the Department of the Treasury (Treasury)—collect duplicative foreign financial account and other asset information from U.S. persons. Consequently, in tax years 2015 and 2016, close to 75 percent of U.S. persons who reported information on foreign accounts and other assets on their tax returns also filed a separate form with FinCEN. The overlapping requirements increase the compliance burden on U.S. persons and add complexity that can create confusion, potentially resulting in inaccurate or unnecessary reporting. Modifying the statutes governing the requirements to allow for the sharing of FATCA information for the prevention and detection of financial crimes would eliminate the need for duplicative reporting. This is similar to other statutory allowances for IRS to disclose return information for other purposes, such as for determining Social Security income tax withholding. According to documents GAO reviewed, and focus groups and interviews GAO conducted, FFIs closed some U.S. persons' existing accounts or denied them opportunities to open new accounts after FATCA was enacted due to increased costs, and risks they pose under FATCA reporting requirements. According to Department of State (State) data, annual approvals of renunciations of U.S. citizenship increased from 1,601 to 4,449—or nearly 178 percent—from 2011 through 2016, attributable in part to the difficulties cited above. Treasury previously established joint strategies with State to address challenges U.S. persons faced in accessing foreign financial services. However, it lacks a collaborative mechanism to coordinate efforts with other agencies to address ongoing challenges in accessing such services or obtaining Social Security Numbers. Implementation of a formal means to collaboratively address burdens faced by Americans abroad from FATCA can help federal agencies develop more effective solutions to mitigate such burdens by monitoring and sharing information on such issues, and jointly developing and implementing steps to address them. GAO is making one matter for congressional consideration to address overlap in foreign asset reporting requirements. GAO is making seven recommendations to IRS and other agencies to enhance IRS's ability to leverage FATCA data to enforce compliance, address unnecessary reporting, and better collaborate to mitigate burdens on U.S. persons living abroad. State and Social Security Administration agreed with GAO's recommendations. Treasury and IRS neither agreed nor disagreed with GAO's recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 13388}
{"pred": " The report provides an overview of the U.S. government's use of emergency and contingency-designated funding since FY2001, particularly in response to the 9/11 attacks. It highlights that Congress has appropriated approximately $2 trillion in discretionary budget authority for war-related and other international emergency activities. This includes $1.8 trillion for the Department of Defense (DOD), $154 billion for the Department of State and USAID, and $3 billion for the Department of Homeland Security and Coast Guard. The report discusses the use of supplemental appropriations, which are often used to fund war-related activities, and the related budgetary and policy issues. It notes that the term \"Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism\" (OCO/GWOT) has been used to exempt certain spending from the Budget Control Act of 2011. The report also examines the debate over the definition and scope of OCO/GWOT designations, which have expanded over time to accommodate strategic, budgetary, and political needs. The report outlines the emergence of the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) designation, which allows funding to be used for activities not directly related to war. It also discusses the implications of using OCO funds for non-war activities, such as infrastructure, support requirements, and in-theater presence. The report also touches on the debate over the use of OCO funds for non-war purposes, with some arguing that it's a necessary tool to address unforeseen needs, while others criticize it as a \"slush fund\" for non-war spending. The report concludes with a discussion of the potential future of OCO funding, including the possibility of Congress increasing the BCA budget caps to allow for more base budget spending, or repealing the BCA altogether.\n\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report.

There", "answers": ["Congressional interest in Overseas Contingency Operation (OCO) funding has continued as Members debate ways of funding priorities without breaching discretionary spending limits set in law. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress has appropriated approximately $2 trillion in discretionary budget authority designated as emergency requirements or for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism (OCO/GWOT) in support of the broad U.S. government response to the 9/11 attacks and for other related international affairs activities. This figure amounts to approximately 9.4% of total discretionary spending during this period. Congress has used supplemental appropriation acts or designated funding for emergency requirements or OCO/GWOT—or both—in statute. These funds are not subject to limits on discretionary spending in congressional budget resolutions or to the statutory discretionary spending limits established by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-125). The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA; P.L. 99-177) allows emergency funding to be excluded from budget control limits. The BCA added the OCO/GWOT designation to the BBEDCA exemption, thereby providing Congress and the President with an alternate way to exclude funding from the BCA spending limits. While there is no overall statutory limit on the amount of emergency or OCO/GWOT spending, both Congress and the President have fundamental roles in determining how much of the spending to provide each fiscal year. Congress must designate any such funding in statute on an account-by-account basis. The President is also required to designate it as such after it is appropriated to be available for expenditure. Debate over what should constitute OCO/GWOT or emergency activities and expenses has shifted over time, reflecting differing viewpoints about the extent, nature, and duration of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere. Funding designated for OCO/GWOT has also been used to fund base-budget requirements of the DOD and State Department and to prevent or respond to crises abroad, including armed conflict, as well as human-caused and natural disasters. Some defense officials and policymakers argue OCO funding allows for flexible response to contingencies, and provides a \"safety valve\" to the spending caps and threat of sequestration—the automatic cancellation of budget authority largely through across-the-board reductions of nonexempt programs and activities—under the BCA. Critics, however, have described OCO/GWOT as a loophole or \"gimmick\"—morphing from an account for replacing combat losses of equipment, resupplying expended munitions, and transporting troops through war zones, to a \"slush fund\" for activities unrelated to contingency operations. Congress appropriated approximately $103 billion for OCO in FY2017 (8.5% of all discretionary appropriations), $78 billion for OCO in FY2018 (5.5% of all discretionary appropriations), and $68.8 billion for OCO so far in FY2019. Discretionary appropriations for FY2019 are not yet final; a continuing resolution expired December 21, 2018. Following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123), which raised discretionary budget caps for defense and foreign affairs agencies in FY2018 and FY2019, the Administration proposed shifting some OCO funding into the base, or regular, budget. Although Congress has generally not followed Administration requests for reduced funding for foreign affairs and domestic activities and has increased funding for defense, the President has asked cabinet secretaries to propose spending cuts of 5% in FY2020. Such proposals, if requested in a budget submission, may create difficult choices for Congress in FY2020 and FY2021—the final two years of the BCA discretionary spending limits.

The report is about the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), focusing on two main areas: the conflict minerals disclosure rule by the SEC and the rate of sexual violence in the DRC and neighboring countries.\n\nFirst, the DRC's background. It's a large country with a population of about 83 million, one-quarter the size of the US. It gained independence from Belgium in 1960, but has had political instability and armed conflict. The \"Africa's World War\" from 1998-2003, which caused 5 million deaths. The eastern DRC has ongoing violence, with illegal armed groups and some military members attacking civilians. In 2012, an armed group took over Goma and clashed with the army. The UN reported sexual violence against civilians, including women and children, by armed groups and some military. In 2017, the UN noted that serious human rights violations remain widespread in the DRC, including continued acts of sexual violence by government security forces and non-state armed groups.\n\nThen, the report talks about the conflict minerals, specifically tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold. These are used in various products. The Dodd-Frank Act required the SEC to promulgate the disclosure rule. The SEC rule outlines a process for companies to follow. The process includes determining if they use conflict minerals, conducting a country-of-origin inquiry, and exercising due diligence. If companies claim their products are conflict-free, they need an independent audit.\n\nThe summary of the SEC's 2017 review found that companies' disclosures were similar to previous years. Most companies conducted country-of-origin inquiries, but faced challenges in determining the origin. Companies that needed to conduct due diligence did so, with most using the OECD framework. However, many couldn't confirm the source of the minerals, and most couldn't determine if the minerals supported armed groups.\n\nThen, the report includes data on sexual violence in the DRC and neighboring countries. There were population-based surveys in Uganda and Burundi in 2016 and 2017, respectively. The surveys found that a significant percentage of women and men had experienced sexual violence. The most recent data for the DRC is from 2016, which showed high rates of sexual violence. The UN and State reported case-file", "answers": ["Over the past decade, the United States and the international community have sought to improve security in the DRC. In the eastern DRC, armed groups have committed severe human rights abuses, including sexual violence, and reportedly profit from the exploitation of “conflict minerals”— in particular, tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold, according to the United Nations. Congress included a provision in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that, among other things, required the SEC to promulgate regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals from the DRC and adjoining countries. The SEC adopted these regulations in 2012. The act also included a provision for GAO to annually assess the SEC regulations' effectiveness in promoting peace and security and report on the rate of sexual violence in the DRC and adjoining countries. In this report, GAO provides information about (1) companies' conflict minerals disclosures filed with the SEC in 2017 compared with disclosures filed in the prior 2 years and (2) the rate of sexual violence in the eastern DRC and adjoining countries published in 2017 and early 2018. GAO analyzed a generalizable random sample of SEC filings and interviewed relevant officials. GAO reviewed U.S., United Nations, and international organizations' reports; interviewed DRC officials, and other stakeholders; and conducted fieldwork in New York at the United Nations headquarters. GAO is not making any recommendations. GAO's review of companies' conflict minerals disclosures filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2017 found that, in general, they were similar to disclosures filed in the prior 2 years. In 2017, 1,165 companies filed conflict minerals disclosures—about the same as in 2016 and 2015. Percentages of companies reporting country-of-origin inquiries in 2017 were also similar to the percentages from those 2 prior years. As a result of the inquiries they conducted, an estimated 53 percent of companies reported in 2017 whether the conflict minerals in their products came from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries—similar to the estimated 49 percent in 2016 and 2015 but significantly higher than the estimate of 30 percent in 2014 (see figure). In their 2017 disclosure reports, many companies described actions they took to improve data collection processes, and most companies indicated some challenges in determining the country of origin. Similar to the prior 2 years, almost all companies required to conduct due diligence, as a result of their country-of-origin inquiries, reported doing so. After conducting due diligence to determine the source and chain of custody of any conflict minerals used, an estimated 37 percent of these companies reported in 2017 that they were able to determine that their conflict minerals came from covered countries or from scrap or recycled sources, compared with 39 and 23 percent in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Four companies in GAO's sample declared their products “DRC conflict-free,” and of those, three included the required Independent Private Sector Audit report (IPSA), and one did not. In 2017, 16 companies filed an IPSA; 19 did so in 2016. GAO found information on the rate of sexual violence in the 2017 Uganda and Burundi Demographic and Health Surveys.

For example, the December 2015 shootings in San Bernardino, California, led to concerns about NIV screening and vetting processes because one of the attackers was admitted into the United States under a NIV. In 2017, the President issued executive actions directing agencies to improve visa screening and vetting, and establishing nationality-based visa entry restrictions, which the Supreme Court upheld in June 2018. GAO was asked to review NIV screening and vetting. This report examines (1) outcomes and characteristics of adjudicated NIV applications from fiscal years 2012 through 2017, and (2) key changes made to the NIV adjudication process in response to executive actions taken in 2017. GAO analyzed State NIV adjudication data for fiscal years 2012 through 2017, the most recent and complete data available. GAO visited seven consular posts selected based on visa workload and other factors. GAO reviewed relevant executive orders and proclamations, and documents related to implementing these actions. This is a public version of a sensitive report issued in June 2018. Information that DHS, State, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence deemed sensitive has been removed. The total number of nonimmigrant visa (NIV) applications that Department of State (State) consular officers adjudicated annually peaked at about 13.4 million in fiscal year 2016, and decreased by about 880,000 adjudications in fiscal year 2017. NIV adjudications varied by visa group, country of nationality, and refusal reason: Visa group. From fiscal years 2012 through 2017, about 80 percent of NIV adjudications were for tourists and business visitors. During this time, adjudications for temporary workers increased by about 50 percent and decreased for students and exchange visitors by about 2 percent. Country of nationality. In fiscal year 2017, more than half of all NIV adjudications were for applicants of six countries of nationality: China (2.02 million, or 16 percent), Mexico (1.75 million, or 14 percent), India (1.28 million, or 10 percent), Brazil (670,000, or 5 percent), Colombia (460,000, or 4 percent), and Argentina (370,000, or 3 percent). Refusal reason. State data indicate that over this time period, 18 percent of adjudicated applications were refused; more than 90 percent were because the applicant did not qualify for the visa sought, and a small percentage (0.05 percent) were due to terrorism and security-related concerns. In 2017, two executive orders and a proclamation issued by the President required, among other actions, visa entry restrictions for nationals of certain listed countries of concern, the development of uniform baseline screening and vetting standards, and changes to NIV screening and vetting procedures. GAO's analysis of State data indicates that, out of the nearly 2.8 million NIV applications refused in fiscal year 2017, 1,338 applications were refused due to visa entry restrictions implemented per the executive actions. State, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and others developed standards for screening and vetting by the U.S. government for all immigration benefits, such as for the requirement for applicants to undergo certain security checks.

It highlights that the FCC's current method, which relies on Form 477 filings, overstates broadband access on tribal lands. The report explains that the FCC's definition of \"available\" broadband service is too broad, as it counts an entire census block as served if only one location has broadband, and allows providers to report availability in blocks where they have no infrastructure connecting homes to their networks. This leads to an overstatement of broadband access on tribal lands. The report also notes that the FCC's data collection process lacks standardization, which results in data that cannot be meaningfully compared across providers. The report further discusses the FCC's strategic goal of increasing all Americans' access to affordable broadband. It also highlights the need for more accurate and complete data on broadband access on tribal lands to ensure that tribes can qualify for federal funding and effectively target the areas that need it most. The report concludes that without addressing these data collection limitations, the risk of continued lack of broadband access on tribal lands remains high.\n\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report. Let me start by reading through the report again to get the main points.\n\nThe report is about the FCC's method of collecting broadband availability data and how it affects tribal lands. The key points are:\n\n1. The FCC uses Form 477, which requires providers to report where they can provide service, not necessarily where they have already deployed it. This leads to overstatements of broadband access on tribal lands.\n\n2. The FCC's method of collecting data on mobile broadband is not standardized, leading to data that cannot be meaningfully compared across providers.\n\n3.

Congress has prioritized identifying and targeting funds to unserved areas. FCC uses data from broadband providers to develop maps and reports depicting broadband availability in the United States, with specific information on tribal lands. GAO was asked to review FCC's efforts to collect broadband data for tribal lands. This report examines the extent to which: (1) FCC's approach to collecting broadband data accurately captures broadband access on tribal lands and (2) FCC obtains tribal input on the data. GAO interviewed stakeholders from 25 tribal governments or tribally owned providers, and visited nine tribal lands. The selected tribes varied geographically and in levels of broadband availability, among other characteristics. GAO also reviewed FCC's rulemakings on broadband data and interviewed other tribal stakeholders, FCC officials, and 13 non-tribal broadband providers selected to include a diversity of technologies. Provider and tribal interviews were based on non-generalizable samples. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) collects data on broadband availability from providers, but these data do not accurately or completely capture broadband access on tribal lands. Specifically, FCC collects data on broadband availability; these data capture where providers may have broadband infrastructure. However, FCC considers broadband to be “available” for an entire census block if the provider could serve at least one location in the census block. This leads to overstatements of service for specific locations like tribal lands (see figure). FCC, tribal stakeholders, and providers have noted that this approach leads to overstatements of broadband availability. Because FCC uses these data to measure broadband access, it also overstates broadband access—the ability to obtain service—on tribal lands. Additionally, FCC does not collect information on several factors—such as affordability, quality, and denials of service—that FCC and tribal stakeholders stated can affect the extent to which Americans living on tribal lands can access broadband services. FCC provides broadband funding for unserved areas based on its broadband data. Overstatements of access limit FCC's and tribal stakeholders' abilities to target broadband funding to such areas. For example, some tribal officials stated that inaccurate data have affected their ability to plan their own broadband networks and obtain funding to address broadband gaps on their lands. By developing and implementing methods for collecting and reporting accurate and complete data on broadband access specific to tribal lands, FCC would be better able to target federal broadband funding to tribal areas that need it the most and to more accurately assess FCC's progress toward its goal of increasing all Americans' access to affordable broadband. FCC does not have a formal process to obtain tribal input on the accuracy of provider-submitted broadband data. In the National Broadband Plan , FCC highlighted the need for a targeted approach to improve broadband availability data for tribal lands. As outlined in the plan, such an approach would include working with tribes to ensure that information is accurate and useful. About half of the tribal stakeholders GAO interviewed raised concerns that FCC relies solely on data from providers, and most stated FCC should work with tribes to improve the accuracy of FCC's data. Establishing a formal process to obtain input from tribal governments on the accuracy of provider-submitted broadband data could help improve the accuracy of FCC's broadband data for tribal lands.

Community banks are typically smaller banks that provide banking services to the local community and have management and board members who reside in the local community. While there is no universally accepted definition of a community bank, they are often defined as banks with under $10 billion in total assets. However, data from financial condition reports that institutions submit to regulators (Call Reports) indicated that of the more than 6,100 banks in the United States, about 90 percent had assets below about $1.2 billion as of March 2016. Credit unions are nonprofit member-owned institutions that take deposits and make loans. Unlike banks, credit unions are subject to limits on their membership because members must have a “common bond”—for example, working for the same employer or living in the same community. The report highlights that community banks are more likely to engage in relationship banking, which involves working with customers over time, while larger banks tend to focus on transaction banking, which is more standardized and requires less human input. Small business lending is an important activity for community banks. As of June 2017, community banks had almost $300 billion outstanding in loans with an original principal balance of under $1 million (which banking regulators.

Smaller community banks and credit unions must comply with some of the regulations, but compliance can be more challenging and costly for these institutions. GAO examined (1) the regulations community banks and credit unions viewed as most burdensome and why, and (2) efforts by depository institution regulators to reduce any regulatory burden. GAO analyzed regulations and interviewed more than 60 community banks and credit unions (selected based on asset size and financial activities), regulators, and industry associations and consumer groups. GAO also analyzed letters and transcripts commenting on regulatory burden that regulators prepared responding to the comments. Interviews and focus groups GAO conducted with representatives of over 60 community banks and credit unions indicated regulations for reporting mortgage characteristics, reviewing transactions for potentially illicit activity, and disclosing mortgage terms and costs to consumers were the most burdensome. Institution representatives said these regulations were time-consuming and costly to comply with, in part because the requirements were complex, required individual reports that had to be reviewed for accuracy, or mandated actions within specific timeframes. However, regulators and others noted that the regulations were essential to preventing lending discrimination and use of the banking system for illicit activity, and they were acting to reduce compliance burdens. Institution representatives also said that the new mortgage disclosure regulations increased compliance costs, added significant time to loan closings, and resulted in institutions absorbing costs when others, such as appraisers and inspectors, changed disclosed fees. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued guidance and conducted other outreach to educate institutions after issuing these regulations in 2013. But GAO found that some compliance burdens arose from misunderstanding the disclosure regulations—which in turn may have led institutions to take actions not actually required. Assessing the effectiveness of the guidance for the disclosure regulations could help mitigate the misunderstandings and thus also reduce compliance burdens. Regulators of community banks and credit unions—the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the National Credit Union Administration—conduct decennial reviews to obtain industry comments on regulatory burden. But the reviews, conducted under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 (EGRPRA), had the following limitations: CFPB and the consumer financial regulations for which it is responsible were not included. Unlike executive branch agencies, the depository institution regulators are not required to analyze and report quantitative-based rationales for their responses to comments. Regulators do not assess the cumulative burden of the regulations they administer. CFPB has formed an internal group that will be tasked with reviewing regulations it administers, but the agency has not publicly announced the scope of regulations included, the timing and frequency of the reviews, and the extent to which they will be coordinated with the other federal banking and credit union regulators as part of their periodic EGRPRA reviews. Congressional intent in mandating that these regulators review their regulations was that the cumulative effect of all federal financial regulations be considered. In addition, sound practices required of other federal agencies require them to analyze and report their assessments when reviewing regulations. Documenting in plans how the depository institution regulators would address these EGRPRA limitations would better ensure that all regulations relevant to community banks and credit unions were reviewed, likely improve the analyses the regulators perform, and potentially result in additional burden reduction. GAO makes a total of 10 recommendations to CFPB and the depository institution regulators. CFPB should assess the effectiveness of guidance on mortgage disclosure regulations and publicly issue its plans for the scope and timing of its regulation reviews and coordinate these with the other regulators' review process. As part of their burden reviews, the depository institution regulators should develop plans to report quantitative rationales for their actions and addressing the cumulative burden of regulations.

For example, the program initially assumed that GMM would implement a software-as-a-service model, but later decided to implement an infrastructure-as-a-service model. The program has experienced various technical challenges in its effort to transfer legacy system data to a data staging platform. These challenges resulted in significant delays and cost increases.

In 2015, FEMA initiated a new endeavor (the GMM program) aimed at streamlining and modernizing the grants management IT environment. GAO was asked to review the GMM program. GAO's objectives were to (1) determine the extent to which FEMA is implementing leading practices for reengineering its grants management processes and incorporating needs into IT requirements; (2) assess the reliability of the program's estimated costs and schedule; and (3) determine the extent to which FEMA is addressing key cybersecurity practices. GAO compared program documentation to leading practices for process reengineering and requirements management, cost and schedule estimation, and cybersecurity risk management, as established by the Software Engineering Institute, National Institute of Standards and Technology, and GAO. Of six important leading practices for effective business process reengineering and information technology (IT) requirements management, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) fully implemented four and partially implemented two for the Grants Management Modernization (GMM) program (see table). Specifically, FEMA ensured senior leadership commitment, took steps to assess its business environment and performance goals, took recent actions to track progress in delivering IT requirements, and incorporated input from end user stakeholders. However, FEMA has not yet fully established plans for implementing new business processes or established complete traceability of IT requirements. Until FEMA fully implements the remaining two practices, it risks delivering an IT solution that does not fully modernize FEMA's grants management systems. While GMM's initial May 2017 cost estimate of about $251 million was generally consistent with leading practices for a reliable, high-quality estimate, it no longer reflects current assumptions about the program. FEMA officials stated in December 2018 that they had completed a revised cost estimate, but it was undergoing departmental approval. GMM's program schedule was inconsistent with leading practices; of particular concern was that the program's final delivery date of September 2020 was not informed by a realistic assessment of GMM development activities, and rather was determined by imposing an unsubstantiated delivery date. Developing sound cost and schedule estimates is necessary to ensure that FEMA has a clear understanding of program risks. Of five key cybersecurity practices, FEMA fully addressed three and partially addressed two for GMM. Specifically, it categorized GMM's system based on security risk, selected and implemented security controls, and monitored security controls on an ongoing basis. However, the program had not initially established corrective action plans for 13 medium- and low-risk vulnerabilities. This conflicts with the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) guidance that specifies that corrective action plans must be developed for every weakness identified. Until FEMA, among other things, ensures that the program consistently follows the department's guidance on preparing corrective action plans for all security vulnerabilities, GMM's system will remain at increased risk of exploits.

Enacted in 1972, the CWA established a federal program to provide grants for the construction of municipal wastewater treatment plants and related eligible activities. The program was initially authorized under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 192-500, which had authorized less ambitious grants since 1956. Title II of P.L. 92-500 authorized grants to states for wastewater treatment plant construction under a program administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Federal funds were provided through annual appropriations under a state-by-state allocation formula contained in the act itself. States used their allotments to make grants to cities to build or upgrade wastewater treatment plants, supporting the overall objectives of the act: restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation's waters. The federal share of project costs, originally 75% under P.L. 92-500, was reduced to 55% in 1981. The Reagan administration sought to phase out the program by 1990. Congress responded with the 1987 amendments to the CWA, which authorized $18 billion over nine years for sewage treatment plant construction, through a combination of the Title II grants program and a new State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds program.

Established as a grant program in 1972, it now capitalizes state loan programs through the clean water state revolving loan fund (CWSRF) program. Since FY1972, appropriations have totaled $98 billion. In 1996, Congress amended the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA, P.L. 104-182) to authorize a similar state loan program for drinking water to help systems finance projects needed to comply with drinking water regulations and to protect public health. Since FY1997, appropriations for the drinking water state revolving loan fund (DWSRF) program have totaled $23 billion. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administers both SRF programs, which annually distribute funds to the states for implementation. Funding amounts are specified in the State and Tribal Assistance Grants (STAG) account of EPA annual appropriations acts. The combined appropriations for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure assistance have represented 25%-32% of total funds appropriated to EPA in recent years. Prior to CWA amendments in 1987 (P.L. 100-4), Congress provided wastewater grant funding directly to municipalities. The federal share of project costs was generally 55%; state and local governments were responsible for the remaining 45%. The 1987 amendments replaced this grant program with the SRF program. Local communities are now often responsible for 100% of project costs, rather than 45%, as they are required to repay loans to states. The greater financial burden of the act's loan program on some cities has caused some to seek continued grant funding. Although the CWSRF and DWSRF have largely functioned as loan programs, both allow the implementing state agency to provide \"additional subsidization\" under certain conditions. Since its amendments in 1996, the SDWA has authorized states to use up to 30% of their DWSRF capitalization grants to provide additional assistance, such as forgiveness of loan principal or negative interest rate loans, to help disadvantaged communities. America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 (AWIA; P.L. 115-270) increased this proportion to 35% while conditionally requiring states to use at least 6% of their capitalization grants for these purposes. Congress amended the CWA in 2014, adding similar provisions to the CWSRF program.

{"pred": " The report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) examines gender-based pricing in consumer goods and its implications in various markets. It finds that, in 5 out of 10 personal care product categories analyzed, women's versions sold at a statistically significant higher average price than men's versions, after controlling for factors like product size, brand, and promotional expenses. For two categories, men's versions were priced higher. The report highlights that these price differences may be influenced by various factors, including gender bias, but it is not possible to determine the exact cause due to the complexity of the market and the lack of comprehensive data. The report also explores the extent to which men and women face different prices or access in markets for credit and goods and services not differentiated by gender. It reviews studies on mortgage, small business credit, auto purchases, and auto repairs, finding that women as a group may pay higher interest rates than men, partly due to weaker credit characteristics. However, the studies have limitations, such as non-representative samples and the absence of key data. The report discusses the role of federal agencies in addressing gender-related price differences, noting that while some laws prohibit sex discrimination in credit and real estate transactions, no federal law explicitly prohibits businesses from charging different prices for the same or similar goods and services targeted to men and women. The agencies like BCFP, FTC, HUD, and DOJ have the authority to investigate and enforce compliance with fair lending laws. The report also highlights state and local efforts to address gender-based pricing, such as California's Gender Tax Repeal Act and Miami-Dade County's Gender Pricing Ordinance. These laws aim to prevent gender-based price discrimination and promote price transparency. The GAO also notes that while there are some consumer complaints about gender-based pricing, the number is relatively small, and the agencies have not developed specific consumer education resources on this topic. The report concludes that while gender-based pricing is a common practice, the extent to which it is based on gender bias remains unclear, and further research and data collection is needed to better understand the issue.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this GAO report. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points. \n\nThe report is about gender-based pricing in consumer goods and how it affects markets. It looks at personal care products like deodorants, shaving products, and hair care products. The main finding is that women's versions of these products sold at higher average prices than men's versions in ", "answers": ["Gender-related price differences occur when consumers are charged different prices for the same or similar goods and services because of factors related to gender. While variation in costs and consumer demand may give rise to such price differences, some policymakers have raised concerns that gender bias may also be a factor. While the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Fair Housing Act prohibit discrimination based on sex in credit and housing transactions, no federal law prohibits businesses from charging consumers different prices for the same or similar goods targeted to different genders. GAO was asked to review gender-related price differences for consumer goods and services sold in the United States. This report examines, among other things, (1) how prices compared for selected goods and services marketed to men and women, and potential reasons for any price differences; (2) what is known about price differences for men and women for products not differentiated by gender, such as mortgages; and (3) the extent to which federal agencies have identified and addressed any concerns about gender-related price differences. To examine these issues, GAO analyzed retail price data, reviewed relevant academic studies, analyzed federal consumer complaint data, and interviewed federal agency officials, industry experts, and academics. Firms differentiate many consumer products to appeal separately to men and women by slightly altering product attributes like color or scent. Products differentiated by gender may sell for different prices if men and women have different demands or willingness to pay for these product attributes. Of 10 personal care product categories (e.g., deodorants and shaving products) that GAO analyzed, average retail prices paid were significantly higher for women's products than for men's in 5 categories. In 2 categories—shaving gel and nondisposable razors—men's versions sold at a significantly higher price. One category—razor blades--had mixed results based on two price measures analyzed, and two others—disposable razors and mass-market perfumes—showed no significant gender price differences. GAO found that the target gender for a product is a significant factor contributing to price differences identified, but GAO did not have sufficient information to determine the extent to which these gender-related price differences were due to gender bias as opposed to other factors, such as different advertising costs. Though the analysis controlled for several observable product attributes, such as product size and packaging type, all underlying differences in costs and demand for products targeted to different genders could not be fully observed. Studies GAO reviewed found limited evidence of gender price differences for four products or services not differentiated by gender—mortgages, small business credit, auto purchases, and auto repairs. For example, with regard to mortgages, women as a group paid higher average mortgage rates than men, in part due to weaker credit characteristics, such as lower average income. However, after controlling for borrower credit characteristics and other factors, three studies did not find statistically significant differences in borrowing costs between men and women, while one found women paid higher rates for certain subprime loans. In addition, one study found that female borrowers defaulted less frequently than male borrowers with similar credit characteristics, and the study suggested that women may pay higher mortgage rates than men relative to their default risk. While these studies controlled for factors other than gender that could affect borrowing costs, several lacked important data on certain borrower risk characteristics, such as credit scores, which could affect analysis of gender disparities. Also, several studies analyzed small samples of subprime loans that were originated in 2005 or earlier, which limits the generalizability of the results. In their oversight of federal antidiscrimination statutes, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, Federal Trade Commission, and Department of Housing and Urban Development have identified limited consumer concerns based on gender-related pricing differences. GAO's analysis of complaint data received by the three agencies from 2012–2017 found that they had received limited consumer complaints about gender-related price differences. The agencies provide general consumer education resources on discrimination and consumer awareness. However, given the limited consumer concern, they have not identified a need to incorporate additional materials specific to gender-related price differences into their existing consumer education resources."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8377}
{"pred": " The report provides an overview of the U.S. hydropower industry, focusing on the regulatory framework and oversight mechanisms implemented by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). It highlights that as of January 2016, there were approximately 90,500 dams in the United States, with about 2,100 associated with hydropower projects, contributing roughly 8% of the nation's total electric generating capacity. These hydropower dams are operated by both non-federal entities, such as private companies and state agencies, and federal agencies like the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. The Federal Power Act empowers FERC to regulate non-federal hydropower projects, which include over 2,500 dams. While FERC does not own or operate dams, it oversees their safety and operation through licensing and regular inspections. Licensees are responsible for the safety and maintenance of dams, and FERC provides oversight to ensure compliance with safety standards. The report outlines FERC's multi-layered approach to dam safety, which includes the Owner’s Dam Safety Program for high and significant hazard dams, regular safety inspections by FERC, independent consultant inspections, and potential relicensing. FERC's Operating Manual and Engineering Guidelines serve as the foundation for its safety oversight. The report also discusses the importance of consistent data recording across FERC's regions, as the current systems are fragmented and lack standardization, which limits the usefulness of the information for broader risk analysis. It notes that FERC has not conducted a portfolio-wide analysis of safety risks, which could help identify and prioritize risks at a national level. The report concludes with two recommendations for FERC: first, to establish standard language and procedures for staff to record inspection data, including how and where to document safety deficiencies, to facilitate cross-regional analysis of safety issues; and second, to use inspection data to assess safety risks across its regulated dams, enabling proactive risk management and mitigation strategies.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report. Let me start by reading through the user's query again to make sure I understand what they need. The report is about the U.S. hydropower industry, focusing on FERC's regulatory framework and oversight. The user provided a detailed report and wants a concise summary.\n\nFirst, I should identify the main points from the report. The report starts by stating there are 90,500 dams in the U.S., with 2,100", "answers": ["In February 2017, components of California's Oroville Dam failed, leading to the evacuation of nearly 200,000 nearby residents. FERC is the federal regulator of the Oroville Dam and over 2,500 other dams associated with nonfederal hydropower projects nationwide. FERC issues and renews licenses—which can last up to 50 years—to dam operators and promotes safe dam operation by conducting safety inspections and reviewing technical engineering studies, among other actions. GAO was asked to review FERC's approach to overseeing dam safety. This report examines: (1) how FERC collects information from its dam safety inspections and the extent of its analysis, and (2) how FERC evaluates engineering studies of dam performance to analyze safety, among other objectives. GAO analyzed documentation on a non-generalizable sample of 42 dams associated with projects relicensed from fiscal years 2014 through 2017, selected based on geography and hazard classifications, among other factors. GAO also reviewed FERC regulations and documents; and interviewed FERC staff associated with the selected projects and technical consultants, selected based on the frequency and timing of their reviews. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) staff generally followed established guidance in collecting safety information from dam inspections for the dams GAO reviewed, but FERC has not used this information to analyze dam safety portfolio-wide. For these 42 dams, GAO found that FERC staff generally followed guidance in collecting safety information during inspections of individual dams and key structures associated with those dams. (See figure.) However, FERC lacks standard procedures that specify how and where staff should record safety deficiencies identified. As a result, FERC staff use multiple systems to record inspection findings, thereby creating information that cannot be easily analyzed. Further, while FERC officials said inspections help oversee individual dam's safety, FERC has not analyzed this information to identify any safety risks across its portfolio. GAO's prior work has highlighted the importance of evaluating risks across a portfolio. FERC officials stated that they have not conducted portfolio-wide analyses because officials prioritize the individual dam inspections and response to urgent dam safety incidents. However, following the Oroville incident, a FERC-led initiative to examine dam structures comparable to those at Oroville identified 27 dam spillways with varying degrees of safety concerns, on which FERC officials stated they are working with dam licensees to address. A similar and proactive portfolio-wide approach, based on analysis of common inspection deficiencies across the portfolio of dams under FERC's authority, could help FERC identify safety risks prior to a safety incident. Guidelines recognize that each dam is unique and allow for flexibility and exemptions in its use. FERC staff use the studies to inform other components of their safety approach, including the analysis of dam failure scenarios and their review of safety to determine whether to renew a license. GAO recommends that FERC: (1) develop standard procedures for recording information collected as part of its inspections, and (2) use inspection information to assess safety risks across FERC's portfolio of dams. FERC agreed with GAO's recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8621}
{"pred": " \n\nThe report outlines the federal child nutrition programs, which provide assistance to schools and other institutions through cash, commodity food, and administrative support. These programs aim to improve children's nutrition and support the agriculture economy. The main programs include the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), School Breakfast Program (SBP), Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), Summer Food Service Program (SFSP), and Special Milk Program (SMP). These programs support the provision of meals and snacks in institutional settings, unlike other food assistance programs such as SNAP, which provide benefits for home consumption. The programs offer financial support and/or foods to the institutions that prepare meals and snacks served outside of the home. The report discusses the eligibility rules, participation, and funding for each program. It also provides an overview of the background and principles that apply to all of the programs. The report describes the nature and extent of the programs' funding, including a discussion of appropriated entitlement status. Table 3 lists child nutrition program and related expenditures. Most spending for child nutrition programs is provided in annual appropriations acts to fulfill the legal financial obligation established by the authorizing laws. The level of spending for such programs, referred to as appropriated mandatory spending, is not controlled through the annual appropriations process, but instead is derived from the benefit and eligibility criteria specified in the authorizing laws. The appropriated mandatory funding is treated as mandatory spending. Further, if Congress does not appropriate the funds necessary to fund the program, eligible entities may have legal recourse. Congress typically considers the Administration's forecast for program needs in its appropriations decisions. For the majority of funding discussed in this report, the formula that controls the funding is not capped and fluctuates based on the reimbursement rates and the number of meals/snacks served in the programs. In the meal service programs, such as the National School Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program, summer programs, and assistance for child care centers and day care homes, federal aid is provided in the form of statutorily set subsidies (reimbursements) paid for each meal/snack served that meets federal nutrition guidelines. Although all meals and snacks served by participating providers are subsidized, those served free or at a reduced price to low-income children are supported at higher rates. All federal meal/snack subsidy rates are indexed annually (each July) for inflation, as are the income eligibility thresholds for free and reduced-price meals/snacks. The report also discusses the principles and concepts common to both the National School Lunch Program and the School Breakfast Program. The report provides an overview of the school", "answers": ["The \"child nutrition programs\" refer to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service (USDA-FNS) programs that provide food for children in school or institutional settings. The best known programs, which serve the largest number of children, are the school meals programs: the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and the School Breakfast Program (SBP). The child nutrition programs also include the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), which provides meals and snacks in day care and after school settings; the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP), which provides food during the summer months; the Special Milk Program (SMP), which supports milk for schools that do not participate in NSLP or SBP; and the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP), which funds fruit and vegetable snacks in select elementary schools. Funding: The vast majority of the child nutrition programs account is considered mandatory spending, with trace amounts of discretionary funding for certain related activities. Referred to as open-ended, \"appropriated entitlements,\" funding is provided through the annual appropriations process; however, the level of spending is controlled by benefit and eligibility criteria in federal law and dependent on the resulting levels of participation. Federal cash funding (in the form of per-meal reimbursements) and USDA commodity food support is guaranteed to schools and other providers based on the number of meals or snacks served and participant category (e.g., free meals for poor children get higher subsidies). Participation: The child nutrition programs serve children of varying ages and in different institutional settings. The NSLP and SBP have the broadest reach, serving qualifying children of all ages in school settings. Other child nutrition programs serve more-narrow populations. CACFP, for example, provides meals and snacks to children in early childhood and after-school settings among other venues. Programs generally provide some subsidy for all food served but a larger federal reimbursement for food served to children from low-income households. Administration: Responsibility for child nutrition programs is divided between the federal government, states, and localities. The state agency and type of local provider differs by program. In the NSLP and SBP, schools and school districts (\"school food authorities\") administer the program. Meanwhile, SFSP (and sometimes CACFP) uses a model in which sponsor organizations handle administrative responsibilities for a number of sites that serve meals. Reauthorization: The underlying laws covering the child nutrition programs were last reauthorized in the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA, P.L. 111-296, enacted December 13, 2010). This law made significant changes to child nutrition programs, including increasing federal financing for school lunches, expanding access to community eligibility and direct certification options for schools, and expanding eligibility options for home child care providers. The law also required an update to school meal nutrition guidelines as well as new guidelines for food served outside the meal programs (e.g., snacks sold in vending machines and cafeteria a la carte lines). Current Issues: The 114th Congress began but did not complete a 2016 child nutrition reauthorization, and there was no significant legislative activity with regard to reauthorization in the 115th Congress. However, the vast majority of operations and activities continue with funding provided by appropriations laws.

{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report about the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report starts by explaining that the federal government provides benefits to coal miners with black lung disease (CWP) when the mine operators can't pay. These benefits are funded by the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, which gets its main revenue from an excise tax on coal. The tax rates were $1.10 per ton for underground and $0.55 for surface in 2018, but dropped to $0.50 and $0.25 in 2019. This reduction in tax rates is expected to put more financial strain on the trust fund, which already borrows from the general fund. The report also mentions that the decline in domestic coal production, the recent increase in the rate of CWP, and the bankruptcies in the coal sector contribute to the financial strain on the trust fund.\n\nThen there's a lot about the Black Lung Program, which was created in 1969. It provides cash benefits to miners totally disabled due to CWP and to the survivors of miners who die from CWP. The program has two parts: Part B and Part C. Part B was administered by SSA, but now DOL. Part C is the current part, where claims are filed with state workers' compensation systems, but since no state has been approved, the federal government pays benefits when the responsible operator can't or won't pay.\n\nThe report discusses the excise tax rates and their impact on the trust fund. The tax rates were reduced, leading to more financial strain. Also, the decline in coal production and the rise in CWP cases and bankruptcies in the coal industry are contributing factors. The report also provides background on black lung disease, its causes, and the benefits under the program. It explains that CWP is caused by inhaling coal dust, leading to lung scarring and reduced lung function. The report then goes into the history of the excise tax, how it was established, and how it has changed over time. The tax rates were increased in the 1980s to help cover the trust fund's expenses, but the tax rates were reduced again in 2019. The report then moves on to discuss policy options to improve the fiscal outlook", "answers": ["The federal government pays benefits to coal miners affected by coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP, commonly referred to as black lung disease) and other lung diseases linked to coal mining in cases where responsible mine operators are not able to pay. In 2019, the monthly benefit for a miner with no dependents is $660.10. Benefits can be as much as $1,320.10 per month for miners with three or more dependents. Medical benefits are provided separately from disability benefits. Benefit payments and related administrative expenses in cases in which the responsible operators do not pay are paid out of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. The primary source of revenue for the trust fund is an excise tax on coal produced and sold domestically. If excise tax revenue is not sufficient to finance Black Lung Program benefits, the trust fund may borrow from the general fund of the Treasury. For 2018, the tax rates on coal were $1.10 per ton of underground-mined coal or $0.55 per ton of surface-mined coal, limited to 4.4% of the sales price. These rates were established in 1986. Starting in 2019, under current law, these tax rates are $0.50 per ton of underground-mined coal or $0.25 per ton of surface-mined coal, limited to 2% of the sales price. These are the rates that were set when the trust fund was established in 1977. The decline in the excise tax rates will likely put additional financial strain on a trust fund that already borrows from the general fund to meet obligations. The decline in domestic coal production, recent increases in the rate of CWP, and bankruptcies in the coal sector also contribute to the financial strain on the trust fund. The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund and associated excise tax on coal were established so that the coal industry, as opposed to taxpayers in general, would bear the burden associated with providing black lung benefits. Throughout its history, the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund has not raised revenues sufficient to meet obligations. As a result, at various points in time, Congress and the President have acted to increase the excise tax on coal, forgive or refinance trust fund debt, and modify black lung benefits eligibility. With the rate of the excise tax on coal reduced in 2019, the 116th Congress may again evaluate options for improving the fiscal condition of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, or other issues related to providing federal benefits to miners with black lung disease."], "all_classes": null, "length": 7218}

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points. \n\nThe report starts by explaining Puerto Rico's status as a U.S. territory with 3.3 million residents. It mentions that Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens but have different tax treatments. For example, they don't pay federal income tax on income from Puerto Rico but do pay on income from outside. Also, they have different access to federal programs like Medicaid. \n\nThen there's a section on the economy. The economy had growth in the 90s and early 2000s but then declined from 2005-2016, with real GDP dropping over 9%. Population also declined, which matched the GDP decline. The employment rate is lower than the U.S. as a whole, and the unemployment rate is higher. \n\nThe government has been in deficit since 2002, and the debt grew. The report discusses factors like inadequate financial management, policy decisions, and prolonged economic contraction. They issued debt to cover deficits instead of cutting spending or raising taxes. \n\nThere's a part about the financial burden from pension obligations. The report also mentions the triple tax exemption, which made Puerto Rico bonds attractive to investors. Then there's the role of the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico (GDB) in facilitating debt accumulation. \n\nThen there are three potential federal actions to address the factors contributing to Puerto Rico's unsustainable debt.

The effects of Hurricanes Irma and Maria will further affect Puerto Rico's ability to repay its debt, as well as its economic condition. In response to Puerto Rico's fiscal crisis, Congress passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Security Act (PROMESA) in 2016, which included a provision for GAO to review Puerto Rico's debt. This report describes the factors that contributed to Puerto Rico's financial condition and levels of debt and federal actions that could address these factors. Consistent with PROMESA, GAO focused on actions that would not increase the federal deficit. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials from the Puerto Rico and federal governments and conducted a review of relevant literature. GAO also interviewed former Puerto Rico officials and experts in Puerto Rico's economy, the municipal securities markets, and state and territorial budgeting, financial management, and debt practices, as well as officials from the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico (created by PROMESA). GAO is not making recommendations based on the federal actions identified because policymakers would need to consider challenges and tradeoffs related to implementation. The Puerto Rico government generally agreed with the factors we identified and provided additional information. GAO incorporated technical comments from SEC as appropriate. The factors that contributed to Puerto Rico's financial condition and levels of debt relate to (1) the Puerto Rico government running persistent annual deficits—where expenses exceed revenues—and (2) its use of debt to cope with deficits. Based on a literature review and interviews with current and former Puerto Rico officials, federal officials, and other relevant experts, GAO identified factors that contributed to Puerto Rico's persistent deficits: The Puerto Rico government's inadequate financial management and oversight practices. For example, the Puerto Rico government frequently overestimated the amount of revenue it would collect and Puerto Rico's agencies regularly spent more than the amounts Puerto Rico's legislature appropriated for a given fiscal year. Policy decisions by Puerto Rico's government. For example, Puerto Rico borrowed funds to balance budgets and insufficiently addressed public pension funding shortfalls. Puerto Rico's prolonged economic contraction. Examples of factors contributing to the contraction include outmigration and the resulting diminished labor force, and the high cost of importing goods and energy. Additional factors enabled Puerto Rico to use debt to finance its deficits, such as high demand for Puerto Rico debt. One cause of high demand was that under federal law, income from Puerto Rico bonds generally receives more favorable tax treatment than income from bonds issued by states and their localities. Based on an assessment of relevant literature and input from current and former Puerto Rico officials, federal officials, and other relevant experts, GAO identified three potential federal actions that may help address some of these factors. GAO also identified considerations for policymakers related to these actions. Modify the tax exempt status for Puerto Rico municipal debt. Making interest income from Puerto Rico bonds earned by investors residing outside of Puerto Rico subject to applicable state and local taxes could lower demand for Puerto Rico debt. However, reduced demand could hinder Puerto Rico's ability to borrow funds for capital investments or liquidity. Apply federal investor protection laws to Puerto Rico. Requiring Puerto Rico investment companies to disclose risks with Puerto Rico bonds and adhere to other requirements could lower demand for the bonds. However, this action could also limit Puerto Rico's ability to borrow funds. Modify the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) authority over municipal bond disclosure requirements. SEC could be allowed to require timely disclosure of materials—such as audited financial statements—associated with municipal bonds. Over the past decade, Puerto Rico often failed to provide timely audited financial statements related to its municipal bonds. Timely disclosure could help investors make informed decisions about investing in municipal bonds. However, a broad requirement could place additional burdens on all U.S. municipal issuers, such as the costs of standardizing reporting."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6356}

GAO has designated the two largest programs, Medicare and Medicaid, as high risk partly due to their vulnerability to fraud, waste, and abuse. In fiscal year 2016, improper payment estimates for these programs totaled about $95 billion. GAO's Fraud Risk Framework and the subsequent enactment of the Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015 have called attention to the importance of federal agencies' antifraud efforts. This report examines (1) CMS's approach for managing fraud risks across its four principal programs, and (2) how CMS's efforts managing fraud risks in Medicare and Medicaid align with the Fraud Risk Framework. GAO reviewed laws and regulations and HHS and CMS documents, such as program-integrity manuals. It also interviewed CMS officials and a sample of CMS stakeholders, including state officials and contractors. GAO selected states based on fraud risk and other factors, such as geographic diversity. GAO selected contractors based on a mix of companies and geographic areas served. The approach that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has taken for managing fraud risks across its four principal programs—Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the health-insurance marketplaces—is incorporated into its broader program-integrity approach. According to CMS officials, this broader program-integrity approach can help the agency develop control activities to address multiple sources of improper payments, including fraud. As the figure below shows, CMS views fraud as part of a spectrum of actions that may result in improper payments. CMS's efforts managing fraud risks in Medicare and Medicaid partially align with GAO's 2015 A Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs (Fraud Risk Framework). This framework describes leading practices in four components: commit , assess , design and implement , and evaluate and adapt . CMS has shown commitment to combating fraud in part by establishing a dedicated entity—the Center for Program Integrity—to lead antifraud efforts. Furthermore, CMS is offering and requiring antifraud training for stakeholder groups such as providers, beneficiaries, and health-insurance plans. However, CMS does not require fraud-awareness training on a regular basis for employees, a practice that the framework identifies as a way agencies can help create a culture of integrity and compliance. Regarding the assess and design and implement components, CMS has taken steps to identify fraud risks, such as by designating specific provider types as high risk and developing associated control activities. However, it has not conducted a fraud risk assessment for Medicare or Medicaid, and has not designed and implemented a risk-based antifraud strategy. A fraud risk assessment allows managers to fully consider fraud risks to their programs, analyze their likelihood and impact, and prioritize risks. Managers can then design and implement a strategy with specific control activities to mitigate these fraud risks, as well as an appropriate evaluation approach consistent with the evaluate and adapt component. By developing a fraud risk assessment and using that assessment to create an antifraud strategy and evaluation approach, CMS could better ensure that it is addressing the full portfolio of risks and strategically targeting the most-significant fraud risks facing Medicare and Medicaid. GAO recommends that CMS (1) provide and require fraud-awareness training to its employees, (2) conduct fraud risk assessments, and (3) create an antifraud strategy for Medicare and Medicaid, including an approach for evaluation.

{"pred": " The report provides an in-depth analysis of the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program, which was established in 2011 under the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012. The RAD program aims to preserve the affordability of federally assisted rental properties and improve their physical and financial condition. It consists of two main components: (1) Converting public housing units owned by Public Housing Authorities (PHAs to Section 8 rental assistance contracts, which can be either project-based voucher (PBV) or project-based rental assistance (PBRA), and (2) Converting privately owned properties with expiring subsidies to PBV or PBRA to maintain affordability and encourage property rehabilitation. The program allows for the conversion of units from public housing to Section 8 rental assistance contracts, which can be either project-based voucher (PBV) or project-based rental assistance (PBRA), and provides flexibility for public housing authorities to access private and public funding sources to supplement public housing funding. The RAD program has been implemented and expanded in phases since its authorization. As of September 30, 2017, 689 conversions had been closed, involving 74,709 units, and 706 conversions were in the process of structuring plans. The program has been successful in increasing the number of units converted, but challenges remain. The report highlights several key areas of concern: First, the program's leverage ratio, which measures the amount of private capital used to fund the conversion, is calculated in a way that may not accurately reflect the actual private-sector leveraging. HUD's methodology for calculating the leverage ratio has been found to include errors, such as misclassifying certain funding sources as private leveraged funds. For example, HUD included Moving to Work (MTW) funds and other public funding sources in the leverage ratio calculation, which may not properly account for the amount of private capital used. The report also discusses the importance of monitoring the long-term affordability of units, which is critical for the program's success. Second, the program's resident safeguards, such as the phase-in of tenant rent increases, resident representation through tenant organizations, and choice mobility options, are not fully developed. The report found that HUD has not systematically use available household data to ensure these protections are in place. Additionally, residents expressed concerns about the information they received on RAD conversions, communication opportunities, and the relocation process. The report also includes recommendations for HUD to improve the", "answers": ["HUD administers the Public Housing program, which provides federally assisted rental units to low-income households through PHAs. In 2010, HUD estimated its aging public housing stock had $25.6 billion in unmet capital needs. To help address these needs, the RAD program was authorized in fiscal year 2012. RAD allows PHAs to move (convert) properties in the public housing program to Section 8 rental assistance programs, and retain property ownership or transfer it to other entities. The conversion enables PHAs to access additional funding, including investor equity, generally not available for public housing properties. GAO was asked to review public housing conversions under RAD and any impact on residents. This report addresses, among other objectives, HUD's (1) assessment of conversion outcomes; (2) oversight of resident safeguards; and (3) provisions to help preserve the long-term affordability of units. GAO analyzed data on RAD conversions through fiscal year 2017; reviewed a sample of randomly selected, nongeneralizable RAD property files; and interviewed HUD officials, PHAs, developers, academics, and affected residents. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) put procedures in place to evaluate and monitor the impact of conversion of public housing properties under the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program. RAD's authorizing legislation requires HUD to assess and publish findings about the amount of private-sector leveraging. HUD uses a variety of metrics to measure conversion outcomes. But, the metric HUD uses to measure private-sector leveraging—the share of private versus public funding for construction or rehabilitation of assisted housing—has limitations. For example, HUD's leveraging ratio counts some public resources as leveraged private-sector investment and does not use final (post-completion) data. As a result, HUD's ability to accurately assess private-sector leveraging is limited. HUD does not systematically use its data systems to track effects of RAD conversions on resident households (such as changes in rent and income, or relocation) or monitor use of all resident safeguards. Rather, since 2016, HUD has required public housing agencies (PHA) or other post-conversion owners to maintain resident logs and collect such information. But the resident logs do not contain historical program information. HUD has not developed a process for systematically reviewing information from its data systems and resident logs on an ongoing basis. HUD has been developing procedures to monitor compliance with some resident safeguards—such as the right to return to a converted property—and begun a limited review of compliance with these safeguards. However, HUD has not yet developed a process for monitoring other safeguards—such as access to other housing voucher options. Federal internal control standards require agencies to use quality information to achieve objectives, and obtain and evaluate relevant and reliable data in a timely manner for use in effective monitoring. Without a comprehensive review of household information and procedures for fully monitoring all resident safeguards, HUD cannot fully assess the effects of RAD on residents. RAD authorizing legislation and the program's use agreements (contracts with property owners) contain provisions intended to help ensure the long-term availability of affordable units, but the provisions have not been tested in situations such as foreclosure. For example, use agreements between HUD and property owners specify affordability and use restrictions that according to the contract would survive a default or foreclosure. HUD officials stated that HUD intends to develop procedures to identify and respond to risks to long-term affordability, including default or foreclosure in RAD properties. However, HUD has not yet done so. According to federal internal control standards, agencies should identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving goals and objectives. Procedures that address oversight of affordability requirements would better position HUD to help ensure RAD conversions comply with program requirements, detect potential foreclosure and other risks, and take corrective actions.

{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report to understand the main points. The report is about how federal agencies acquire and manage heavy equipment. \n\nFirst, the report mentions that agencies usually get equipment from commercial vendors or through GSA, which contracts with vendors. They can purchase or lease the equipment. The term \"lease\" is used for both long-term and short-term, but agencies have different definitions. For example, the Air Force uses \"rental\" for under 120 days, while FWS and NPS use it for up to a year. The report uses \"rental\" for short-term and \"long-term lease\" for longer ones.\n\nThen there's the GSA's Short-Term Rental program, started in 2013, allowing agencies to rent heavy equipment for less than a year. This helps avoid ownership and maintenance costs for infrequent use. However, there are no central reporting requirements for heavy equipment inventories, unlike other federal property. Agencies use their own databases, with varying data requirements.\n\nThe report also discusses the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) which requires agencies to consider leasing versus purchasing. They should conduct a lease-versus-purchase analysis. Also, DOD regulations require justification for leases over 60 days.\n\nThen there's data on the number of heavy equipment items owned by agencies. The report says 20 agencies reported owning over 136,000 items, with DOD having the most at over 100,000. The Department of Agriculture had the second-highest number. The other agencies had fewer items. The types of equipment include cranes, backhoes, and road maintenance equipment. The largest category was construction, mining, excavating, and highway maintenance equipment.\n\nThe report also mentions the cost of acquiring this equipment, with over $7.4 billion spent in 2016 dollars. However, some items lacked acquisition cost or year data, making it hard to adjust for inflation. The Army's data was not centrally available, requiring resource-intensive collection.\n\nThe report then talks about the lease-versus-purchase analyses. It found that agencies like the Department of Agriculture had almost 9,000 items. The cost varied, with most items costing less than $250,000. High-cost items included specialized machinery.\n\nThen there", "answers": ["Federal agencies use heavy equipment such as cranes and forklifts to carry out their missions, but there is no government-wide data on federal agencies' acquisition or management of this equipment. GAO was asked to review federal agencies' management of heavy equipment. This report, among other objectives, examines: (1) the number, type, and costs of heavy equipment items that are owned by 20 federal agencies and (2) the heavy equipment that selected agencies recently acquired as well as how they decided whether to purchase or lease this equipment. GAO collected heavy equipment inventory data as of June 2017 from the 24 agencies that have chief financial officers responsible for overseeing financial management. GAO also selected three agencies (using factors such as the heavy equipment fleet's size) and reviewed their acquisitions of and guidance on heavy equipment. These agencies' practices are not generalizable to all acquisitions but provide insight into what efforts these agencies take to acquire thousands of heavy equipment items. GAO also interviewed officials at the three selected agencies. Of the 24 agencies GAO reviewed, 20 reported owning over 136,000 heavy equipment items such as cranes, backhoes, and forklifts, and spending over $7.4 billion (in 2016 dollars) to acquire this equipment. The remaining 4 agencies reported that they do not own any heavy equipment. The three selected agencies GAO reviewed in-depth—the Air Force within the Department of Defense (DOD), and the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service within the Department of the Interior (Interior)—spent about $360 million to purchase about 3,500 heavy equipment assets in calendar years 2012 through 2016 and over $5 million to lease heavy equipment from fiscal years 2012 through 2016. Officials from all three agencies stated that they consider mission needs and the availability of equipment leases when deciding whether to lease or purchase heavy equipment. Federal regulations provide that agencies should consider whether it is more economical to lease or purchase equipment when acquiring heavy equipment, and federal internal control standards require that management clearly document all transactions in a manner that allows the documentation to be readily available for examination. However, in reviewing selected leases and purchases of heavy equipment from these three agencies, GAO found that officials did not consistently conduct or document lease-versus-purchase analyses. Officials at the Air Force and Interior said that there was a lack of clarity in agency policies about when they were required to conduct and document such analyses. Without greater clarity on when lease-versus-purchase analyses should be conducted and documented, these agencies may not be spending funds on heavy equipment effectively. The Department of the Interior and the Air Force should clarify the circumstances in which lease-versus-purchases analyses for heavy equipment acquisitions are to be conducted and documented. The Departments of the Interior and Defense concurred with these recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6750}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. \n\nThe report is about the Department of Defense (DOD) workforce changes since 2001. It mentions that the total workforce, including military, civilian, and contractors, peaked around 2011 and has been decreasing since. Factors contributing to this change include U.S. involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan, military to civilian conversions, contractor insourcing, and growth in areas like acquisition and cyber.\n\nThe management of the workforce is governed by certain statutes, like sections 129, 129a, and 2463 of Title 10. These sections outline how the workforce should be managed, with a focus on cost efficiency and the appropriate mix of services. DOD Instruction 1100.22 provides the policy and procedures for determining the workforce mix, including cost comparisons for new or expanding mission requirements and functions that have been contracted but could be performed by DOD civilian employees.\n\nThe report also discusses a Cost-Comparison Report that DOD conducted. They compared the full cost of functions performed by federal civilians and service contractors. However, the report found that DOD did not account for the full cost of these personnel as required by the mandate. They excluded non-labor costs such as facility overhead, which is a key component of the full cost. The report mentions that DOD excluded certain non-labor costs from its cost calculations, which led to partial addressing of the reporting elements.\n\nDOD's methodology for comparing costs involved identifying labor costs for selected functions. They used data from various sources, including the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System. They also conducted site visits to understand the actual tasks performed by employees. They compared the costs of all federal civilians and service contractors identified as performing similar functions. The report also highlights challenges in accurately accounting for the full cost of civilian and contractor personnel, including facility overhead, which is a significant part of the full cost.\n\nThe DOD has taken steps to better understand the costs associated with its workforces, but there are still some recommendations that have not been fully implemented. The report concludes that DOD partially addressed the mandated reporting elements, and further actions are needed to fully comply with the congressional requirements.\n\nNow, I need to condense this into a one-page summary. Let me structure it with an introduction, key points, and conclusion. I should mention the workforce changes, the statutes", "answers": ["In addition to more than 2.2 million active duty and reserve personnel, DOD employs about 760,000 federal civilians and more than 560,000 contractors. In the Senate Report 114-49 accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 included a provision for DOD to issue a report (1) assessing functions performed by federal civilian and service contractor personnel, (2) accounting for the full costs of federal civilian and service contractor personnel performing these functions, (3) comparing these costs, and (4) assessing available hiring and retention authorities for federal civilians. The Senate report also included a provision for GAO to assess DOD's report, which DOD submitted to Congress in April 2017. This report examines the extent to which DOD's report addressed the prescribed congressional elements. GAO reviewed DOD's report and compared it to the prescribed elements, examined documents relevant to DOD's cost estimating and comparison methodology, and interviewed DOD officials, including those in its Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation responsible for the calculations in DOD's report. In response to Congressional direction, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a report in April 2017 comparing the costs of federal civilian and service contractor personnel at select installations. The report addressed three out of four provision elements and partially addressed one, as discussed below. DOD concluded that neither federal civilians nor service contractors were predominately more or less expensive, with costs being dependent on position, location, and level of seniority. DOD noted that it used a non-probability based sample of personnel for its report, and the results are not generalizable. An assessment of performance of functions being performed by federal civilian and service contractor personnel at six military installations, with four being in the continental United States and two being outside the continental United States. GAO believes that DOD addressed this requirement because it developed a methodology to assess performance of functions performed by federal civilians and service contractors at 17 organizations within nine geographic regions including two locations outside the continental United States. DOD used data from the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System to identify military installations with large reported numbers of federal civilians. DOD determined that personnel need to perform at least 80 percent common tasks to be able to make a comparison. An accounting of the fully-burdened, or full, cost of federal civilian and service contractor personnel performing functions at the selected installations including training, benefits, reimbursable costs, and facility overhead. GAO believes that DOD partially addressed this requirement because while it calculated the labor costs of selected federal civilian and service contractor full-time equivalents performing similar functions for organizations at government-owned facilities, it excluded certain non-labor costs from its calculations. A comparison of the costs of performance of these functions by federal civilians and service contractor personnel at the selected installations. GAO believes that DOD addressed this requirement because it compared calculated costs for selected federal civilians and service contractors performing similar functions at selected installations and included those comparisons in its report. An assessment of the flexible employment authorities for the employment and retention of federal civilian employees. GAO believes that DOD addressed this requirement because it sent questionnaires to DOD hiring officials and human resource professionals to collect information on flexible employment authorities and conducted interviews with these and human resource professionals at the same 17 organizations used for the cost comparison. Based on an analysis of the information collected, DOD's report included several conclusions regarding flexible hiring authorities and made one recommendation. GAO is not making any recommendations; however, DOD non-concurred with GAO's assessment that DOD partially addressed the element to account for the full cost of personnel.

DHS's acquisition activities are on GAO's High Risk List, in part, because of management and funding issues. The Explanatory Statement accompanying the DHS Appropriations Act, 2015 included a provision for GAO to review DHS's major acquisitions. This report, GAO's fourth annual review, assesses the extent to which: (1) DHS's major acquisition programs are on track to meet their schedule and cost goals, and (2) DHS has taken actions to enhance its policies and processes to better reflect key practices for effectively managing a portfolio of investments. GAO reviewed 28 acquisition programs, including DHS's largest programs that were in the process of obtaining new capabilities as of April 2017, and programs GAO or DHS identified as at risk of poor outcomes. GAO assessed cost and schedule progress against baselines, assessed DHS's policies and processes against GAO's key portfolio management practices, and met with relevant DHS officials. During 2017, 10 of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) programs GAO assessed that had approved schedule and cost goals were on track to meet those goals. GAO reviewed 28 programs in total, 4 of which were new programs that GAO did not assess because they did not establish cost and schedule goals before the end of calendar year 2017 as planned. The table shows the status of the 24 programs GAO assessed. Reasons for schedule delays or cost increases included technical challenges, changes in requirements, and external factors. Recent enhancements to DHS's acquisition management, resource allocation, and requirements policies largely reflect key portfolio management practices (see table). However, DHS is in the early stages of implementing these policies. GAO identified two areas where DHS could strengthen its portfolio management policies and implementation efforts: DHS's policies do not reflect the key practice to reassess a program that breaches—or exceeds—its cost, schedule, or performance goals in the context of the portfolio to ensure it is still relevant or affordable. Acquisition management officials said that, in practice, they do so based on a certification of funds memorandum—a tool GAO has found to be effective for DHS leadership to assess program affordability—submitted by the component when one of its programs re-baselines in response to a breach. Documenting this practice in policy would help ensure DHS makes strategic investment decisions within its limited budget. DHS is not leveraging information gathered from reviews once programs complete implementation to manage its portfolio of active acquisition programs. DHS's acquisition policy requires programs to conduct post-implementation reviews after initial capabilities are deployed, which is in line with GAO's key practices. Acquisition management officials said they do not consider the results of these reviews in managing DHS's portfolio because the reviews are typically conducted after oversight for a program shifts to the components. Leveraging these results across DHS could enable DHS to address potential issues that may contribute to poor outcomes, such as schedule slips and cost growth, for other programs in its acquisition portfolio. GAO recommends DHS update its acquisition policy to require certification of fund memorandums when programs re-baseline as a result of a breach and assess programs' post-implementation reviews to improve performance across the acquisition portfolio.

{"pred": " The report discusses the Navy's readiness challenges following four significant mishaps in 2017 that resulted in 17 sailor deaths and ship damage. The Navy faced issues like outdated ships, expired training certifications, reduced crew sizes leading to overwork and safety risks, and delays in maintenance. Since then, the Navy has conducted two internal reviews, resulting in 111 recommendations to improve surface fleet readiness. An executive group was formed to oversee the implementation, and as of November 2018, 78 (70%) of these recommendations had been implemented. However, the Navy acknowledges that full implementation will require significant time and management focus to address the fundamental readiness challenges. The report highlights that the Navy has made progress in training certifications, reducing the percentage of expired certifications from 41% in September 2017 to 9% in November 2018. However, challenges such as maintenance delays and manning issues persist, which could hinder the Navy's ability to rebuild readiness and prepare for future challenges. The report also discusses the Department of Defense's (DOD) efforts to rebuild readiness, emphasizing the importance of restoring and retaining readiness across the entire spectrum of conflict. Despite these efforts, the report notes that readiness of the total military force remains low and has remained so since 2513. The Navy has been working on expanding its fleet by 25 percent, which could exacerbate existing maintenance and manning challenges. The report outlines the Navy's efforts to ensure crews are certified before deployment, with some success in reducing expired certifications. However, training for amphibious operations and higher-level collective training may not be fully implemented for several years. The report also discusses the challenges in maintaining and upgrading legacy weapon systems, as well as procuring new ones to counter emerging threats. The Navy has taken steps to provide dedicated training time for surface forces to meet training standards. However, the Navy continues to struggle with rebuilding the readiness of the existing fleet due to ongoing maintenance and manning challenges. The report highlights that the Navy's readiness recovery is based on strict adherence to deployment, training, and maintenance schedules. However, the Navy has struggled to complete maintenance on time, resulting in delays that reduce time for training and operations and create costly inefficiencies in a resource-constrained environment.

The Navy and Marine Corps are working to rebuild the readiness of their forces while growing and modernizing their aging fleet of ships and aircraft. However, achieving readiness recovery goals will take years as both services continue to be challenged to rebuild readiness amid continued operational demands. This statement provides information on current and future readiness challenges facing (1) the Navy ship and submarine fleet and (2) Navy and Marine Corps aviation. GAO also discusses prior recommendations on Navy and Marine Corps readiness and progress to address them. This statement is based on previously published work since 2015 related to Navy and Marine Corps readiness challenges, including shipyard workforce and capital investment, ship crewing, weapon system sustainment, the fighter pilot workforce, and modernizing force structure. GAO conducted site visits to the Pacific fleet in November 2018 and analyzed updated data, as appropriate. The Navy has taken steps to address training shortfalls in the surface fleet, but faces persistent maintenance and personnel challenges as it seeks to rebuild ship and submarine readiness. While the Navy has corrective actions underway, they will take years to implement. Following ship collisions in 2017, the Navy has taken steps to ensure its crews are trained to standards prior to deployment and made significant progress in those efforts. However, the Navy has struggled to complete ship maintenance—with only 30 percent of maintenance completed on time since fiscal year 2012—leading to thousands of days that ships were unavailable for training and operations (see figure). Additionally, manning shortfalls and experience gaps continue to contribute to high sailor workload and are likely to continue through at least fiscal year 2021. The Navy has developed a plan to improve shipyards and is re-examining its ship manning, among other actions; however, these positive steps have not yet fully addressed GAO's recommendations. Looking to the future, the Navy has indicated that it wants to grow its fleet to meet demands. However, the costs of such growth are not yet known and would likely require resourcing well above currently planned levels. Navy and Marine Corps aircraft availability has been limited due to numerous challenges (see figure). Specifically, the seven aircraft GAO reviewed have generally experienced decreasing availability since fiscal year 2011 and did not meet availability goals in fiscal years 2017 and 2018. The F-35—the future of naval aviation—also has not met availability goals due to part shortages and poor sustainment planning. In September 2018, the Department of Defense established aggressive targets for aircraft availability. While the Navy and Marine Corps are taking actions to improve aircraft availability, including addressing GAO's recommendations, aviation readiness will take many years to recover. GAO has made a total of 45 recommendations in the prior work described in this statement.

{"pred": " (One page, 500 words)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report explains that FHA is part of HUD and insures private lenders against borrower defaults. If a borrower defaults, FHA pays the lender the remaining amount. The insurance protects the lender, not the borrower. FHA is one of three agencies providing insurance, along with VA and USDA. FHA is the most broadly targeted, not limited by factors like veteran status, income, or rural areas. But availability may be limited by factors like max mortgage amount, fees, and eligibility standards.\n\nThe FHA was created in 1934 during the Great Depression to encourage lending and stimulate construction. Before FHA, mortgages were short-term and risky. FHA introduced 20-year mortgages with full repayment. This helped rebuild confidence in the mortgage market.\n\nFHA plays a countercyclical role, insuring more mortgages when the market is weak and fewer when it's strong. It helps during downturns when other lenders are not willing to lend. This makes it accessible to those who might not qualify for conventional loans.\n\nFHA-insured loans have lower down payments, less stringent credit requirements, and are often used by first-time buyers, low- and moderate-income households, and minorities. For example, 83% of FHA loans in FY2018 were for first-time buyers. Over a third of all FHA loans were to minority borrowers.\n\nThe report also covers eligibility criteria, down payment requirements, and mortgage insurance premiums. FHA requires a minimum credit score of 500, with higher down payments for lower scores. The maximum loan amounts vary by area and property type.\n\nOkay, I need to condense all this into a one-page summary. Let me structure it with an introduction, key points about FHA's role, eligibility, down payments, insurance premiums, market share, and a conclusion. I should mention the creation in 1934, the count of loans, the count of first-time buyers, minorities, etc. Also, the count of loans in FY2018, the market share, and the financial aspects of the MMI Fund. But the report says it doesn't go into detail on the financial status, so maybe just mention that it's covered in another report. Also, the count of loans in FY2018 was over 8 million, with a balance", "answers": ["The Federal Housing Administration (FHA), an agency of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), was created by the National Housing Act of 1934. FHA insures private lenders against the possibility of borrowers defaulting on mortgages that meet certain criteria, thereby expanding the availability of mortgage credit beyond what may be available otherwise. If the borrower defaults on the mortgage, FHA is to repay the lender the remaining amount owed. A household that obtains an FHA-insured mortgage must meet FHA's eligibility and underwriting standards, including showing that it has sufficient income to repay a mortgage. FHA requires a minimum down payment of 3.5% from most borrowers, which is lower than the down payment required for many other types of mortgages. FHA-insured mortgages cannot exceed a statutory maximum mortgage amount, which varies by area and is based on area median house prices but cannot exceed a specified ceiling in high-cost areas. (The ceiling is set at $726,525 in high-cost areas in calendar year 2019.) Borrowers are charged fees, called mortgage insurance premiums, in exchange for the insurance. In FY2018, FHA insured over 1 million new mortgages (including both home purchase and refinance mortgages) with a combined principal balance of $209 billion. FHA's share of the mortgage market tends to vary with economic conditions and other factors. In the aftermath of the housing market turmoil that began around 2007 and a related contraction of mortgage lending, FHA insured a larger share of mortgages than it had in the preceding years. Its overall share of the mortgage market increased from about 3% in calendar year 2005 to a peak of 21% in 2009. Since that time, FHA's share of the mortgage market has decreased somewhat, though it remains higher than it was in the early 2000s. In calendar year 2017, FHA's overall share of the mortgage market was about 17%. FHA-insured mortgages, like all mortgages, experienced increased default rates during the housing downturn that began around 2007, leading to concerns about the stability of the FHA insurance fund for single-family mortgages, the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund). In response to these concerns, FHA adopted a number of policy changes in an attempt to limit risk to the MMI Fund. These changes have included raising the fees that it charges and making changes to certain eligibility criteria for FHA-insured loans."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5182}

The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget estimates the ship's procurement cost at $13,084.0 million (i.e., about $13.1 billion) in then-year dollars. The ship received advance procurement (AP) funding in FY2001-FY2007 and was fully funded in FY2008-FY2011 using congressionally authorized four-year incremental funding. To help cover cost growth on the ship, the ship received an additional $1,394.9 million in FY2014-FY2016 and FY2018 cost-to-complete procurement funding. The ship was delivered to the Navy on May 31, 2017, and was commissioned into service on July 22, 2017. The Navy is currently working to complete construction, testing, and certification of the ship's 11 weapons elevators. CVN-79 (John F. Kennedy) was procured in FY2013. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget estimates the ship's procurement cost at $11,327.4 million (i.e., about $11.3 billion) in then-year dollars. The ship received AP funding in FY2007-FY2012, and was fully funded in FY2013-FY2018 using congressionally authorized six-year incremental funding. The ship is scheduled for delivery to the Navy in September 2024. CVN-80 (Enterprise) and CVN-81 (not yet named) are being procured under a two-ship block buy contract that was authorized by Section 121(a)(2) of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (H.R. 5515/P.L. 115-232 of August 13, 2018). The provision permitted the Navy to add CVN-81 to the existing contract for building CVN-80 after the Department of Defense (DOD) made certain certifications to Congress. DOD made the certifications on December 31, 2018, and the Navy announced the award of the contract on January 31, 2019. Compared to the estimated procurement costs for CVN-80 and CVN-81 in the Navy's FY2019 budget submission, the Navy estimates under its FY2020 budget submission that the two-ship block buy contract will reduce the cost of CVN-80 by $246.6 million and the cost of CVN-81 by $2,637.3 million, for a combined reduction of $2,883.9 million (i.e., about $2.9 billion). Using higher estimated baseline costs for CVN-80 and CVN-81 taken from a December 2017 Navy business case analysis, the Navy estimates under its FY2020 budget submission that the two-ship contract will reduce the cost of CVN-80 by $770.9 million and the cost of CVN-81 by $3,086.3 million, for a combined reduction of $3,857.2 million (i.e., about $3.9 billion). CVN-80 was procured in FY2018. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget estimates the ship's procurement cost at $12,335.1 million (i.e., about $12.3 billion) in then-year dollars.

The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests $1,062.0 million in procurement funding for the ship. The ship is scheduled for delivery to the Navy in March 2028. Prior to the awarding of the two-ship block buy contract, CVN-81 was scheduled to be procured in FY2023. Following the awarding of the two-ship block buy contract, the Navy has chosen to show CVN-81 in its FY2020 budget submission as a ship to be procured in FY2020 (as opposed to a ship that was procured in FY2019). The Navy's FY2020 budget submission estimates the ship's procurement cost at $12,450.7 million (i.e., about $12.5 billion) in then-year dollars. The Navy plans to fully fund the ship beginning in FY2019 and extending beyond FY2026 using incremental funding authorized by Section 121(c) of P.L. 115-232. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests $1,285.0 million in procurement funding for the ship. The ship is scheduled for delivery to the Navy in February 2032. The Navy's FY2020 budget submission proposed to not fund the mid-life nuclear refueling overhaul (called a Refueling Complex Overhaul, or RCOH) for the aircraft carrier CVN-75 (Harry S. Truman), and to instead retire the ship around FY2024 and also deactivate one of the Navy's carrier air wings at about the same time. On April 30, 2019, however, the Administration announced that it was effectively withdrawing this proposal from the Navy's FY2020 budget submission. The Administration now supports funding the CVN-75 RCOH and keeping CVN-75 (and by implication its associated air wing) in service past FY2024. Oversight issues for Congress for the CVN-78 program include the following: DOD's decision to show CVN-81 in its FY2020 budget submission as a ship to be procured in FY2020, instead of a ship that was procured in FY2019; the Navy's decision, as part of its FY2020 budget submission, to not accelerate the scheduled procurement of CVN-82 from FY2028 to an earlier fiscal year; whether to approve, reject, or modify the Navy's FY2020 procurement funding request for the CVN-78 program; the date for achieving the Navy's 12-ship force-level goal for aircraft carriers; cost growth in the CVN-78 program, Navy efforts to stem that growth, and Navy efforts to manage costs so as to stay within the program's cost caps; Navy efforts to complete the construction, testing, and certification of the weapons elevators on CVN-78; additional CVN-78 program issues that were raised in a December 2018 report from the Department of Defense's (DOD's) Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E); additional CVN-78 program issues that were raised in a May 2019 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on DOD weapon systems; whether the Navy should shift at some point from procuring large-deck, nuclear-powered carriers like the CVN-78 class to procuring smaller aircraft carriers."], "all_classes": null, "length": 32726}
{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report to understand the main points. The report is about risk management for federal facilities, specifically focusing on the Interagency Security Committee (ISC) and how four agencies are aligning their security assessment methodologies with the ISC's standards.\n\nFirst, the report mentions that risk management involves assessing threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences, then responding with countermeasures, and monitoring with quality information. The ISC was established in 12977 after the Oklahoma City bombing. Their role is to develop and enforce security standards for federal facilities, ensuring compliance and effective security measures.\n\nThe ISC Standard outlines a process for agencies to develop their risk assessment methodologies. It requires agencies to determine the facility security level (from I to V), assess three factors of risk for each undesirable event, and combine them to yield a measurable risk level. Based on this, agencies should customize countermeasures to match the risk level.\n\nHowever, the report found that none of the four agencies' methodologies fully aligned with the ISC Standard. The agencies didn't consider all 33 undesirable events, and they didn't assess threats and consequences for each event. For example, CBP's methodology didn't fully consider all undesirable events and didn't assess threats and consequences. They used a checklist that only assessed vulnerabilities, not the other factors. FAA's approach also had gaps, like not assessing consequences and using a standardized threat level.\n\nThe report also discusses management challenges, such as backlogs of assessments, insufficient staff, and lack of data for monitoring. Agencies like CBP and FAA had plans to address these issues, but the timelines and assumptions didn't seem feasible.\n\nThe key recommendations are for the agencies to update their policies and procedures to fully incorporate the ISC Standard, balance assessments with other priorities, and implement systems for data collection and analysis. The agencies have agreed with the findings and recommendations, and are working on implementing the changes.\n\nI need to condense all this into a one-page summary. Let me structure it with an introduction, the main findings, the challenges, and the recommendations. I should mention the ISC's role, the agencies' current methodologies, the misalignment with the standards, the management issues, and the actions taken by the agencies. Also, note the conclusion that agencies need to align their risk assessments with the ISC Standard to ensure proper security and resource allocation.\n\nI need to make sure", "answers": ["Protecting federal employees and facilities from security threats is of critical importance. Most federal agencies are generally responsible for their facilities and have physical security programs to do so. GAO was asked to examine how federal agencies assess facilities' security risks. This report examines: (1) how selected agencies' assessment methodologies align with the ISC's risk management standard for identifying necessary countermeasures and (2) what management challenges, if any, selected agencies reported facing in conducting physical security assessments and monitoring the results. GAO selected four agencies—CBP, FAA, ARS, and the Forest Service—based on their large number of facilities and compared each agency's assessment methodology to the ISC Standard; analyzed facility assessment schedules and results from 2010 through 2016; and interviewed security officials. GAO also visited 13 facilities from these four agencies, selected based on geographical dispersion and their high risk level. None of the four agencies GAO reviewed—U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), and the Forest Service—used security assessment methodologies that fully aligned with the Interagency Security Committee's Risk Management Process for Federal Facilities standard (the ISC Standard). This standard requires that methodologies used to identify necessary facility countermeasures—such as fences and closed-circuit televisions—must: 1. Consider all of the undesirable events (i.e., arson and vandalism) identified by the ISC Standard as possible risks to facilities. 2. Assess three factors—threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences—for each of these events and use these three factors to measure risk. All four agencies used methodologies that included some ISC requirements when conducting assessments. CBP and FAA assessed vulnerabilities but not threats and consequences. ARS and the Forest Service assessed threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences, but did not use these factors to measure risk. In addition, the agencies considered many, but not all 33 undesirable events related to physical security as possible risks to their facilities. Agencies are taking steps to improve their methodologies. For example, ARS and the Forest Service now use a methodology that measures risk and plan to incorporate the methodology into policy. Although CBP and FAA have updated their methodologies, their policies do not require methodologies that fully align with the ISC standard. As a result, these agencies miss the opportunity for a more informed assessment of the risk to their facilities. All four agencies reported facing management challenges in conducting physical security assessments or monitoring assessment results. Specifically, CBP, ARS, and the Forest Service have not met the ISC's required time frame of every 3 years for conducting assessments. For example, security specialists have not conducted required reassessments of two ARS and one Forest Service higher-level facilities. While these three agencies have plans to address backlogs, CBP's plan does not balance conducting risk assessments with other competing security priorities, such as updating its policy manual, and ARS and the Forest Service lack a means to monitor completion of future assessments. Furthermore, CBP, ARS, and the Forest Service did not have the data or information systems to monitor assessment schedules or the status of countermeasures at facilities, and their policies did not specify such data requirements. For example, ARS and the Forest Service do not collect and analyze security-related data, such as countermeasures' implementation. FAA does not routinely monitor the performance of its physical security program. Without improved monitoring, agencies are not well equipped to prioritize their highest security needs, may leave facilities' vulnerabilities unaddressed, and may not take corrective actions to meet physical security program objectives. This is a public version of a sensitive report that GAO issued in August 2017. Information that the agencies under review deemed sensitive has been omitted. GAO recommends: (1) that CBP and FAA update policies to require the use of methodologies fully aligned with the ISC Standard; (2) that CBP revise its plan to eliminate the assessments backlog; and (3) that all four agencies improve monitoring of their physical security programs. All four agencies agreed with the respective recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6755}
{"pred": " The report discusses the Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) system used by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to estimate the national Medicaid improper payment rate. PERM is mandated by the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA) and its amendments, requiring federal agencies to identify programs susceptible to improper payments and estimate the amount of improper payments annually. CMS uses PERM to target program integrity activities and oversight of states’ Medicaid programs. The Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010 further requires the Inspector General to conduct compliance reviews. OMB designated Medicaid as a high priority program. PERM calculates the Medicaid improper payment rate by computing an annual rolling average of improper payment rates across all states based on a 17-state, 3-year rotation cycle. The PERM methodology is reviewed by the HHS-OIG every four years. The PERM has three components: Fee-for-Service (FFS), managed care, and eligibility. The FFS component measures errors in a sample of FFS claims, which are records of services provided and the amount the Medicaid program paid for these services. The managed care component measures errors in the capitated payments that state Medicaid agencies make to MCOs on behalf of enrollees. The eligibility component measures errors in state determinations of whether enrollees meet categorical and financial criteria for receipt of benefits under the Medicaid program. The eligibility component has not been calculated since 2014, and CMS piloted different approaches to update methodologies used to assess enrollee eligibility, as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act changed income eligibility requirements for nonelderly, nonpregnant individuals who qualify for Medicaid. The PERM is used to target program integrity activities and oversight of states’ Medicaid programs. The report highlights that the PERM system has limitations in its ability to measure program integrity risks in Medicaid managed care. The PERM system does not account for overpayments to providers and unallowable MCO costs, which can lead to higher future capitation rates and increased spending. The PERM system does not include errors in capitated payments, such as payments for services that were not provided or medically necessary, or to ineligible, excluded, or deceased providers, which are not measured by the PERM. The PERM system is not able to account for other program integrity risks, such as overpayments to providers and unallowable MCO costs. The PERM system is not able to account for overpayments to providers and unallowable M", "answers": ["The improper payment rate is a sentinel measure of program integrity risks for the Medicaid program. CMS and the states oversee Medicaid, whose size, structure, and diversity make it vulnerable to improper payments. CMS estimates the Medicaid improper payment rate annually through its PERM, which includes an estimate for Medicaid managed care, in which states contract with MCOs to provide services to Medicaid enrollees. GAO was asked to study the PERM methodology for managed care. In this report, GAO examined the extent to which the PERM accounts for program integrity risks in Medicaid managed care, including CMS's and states' oversight. GAO identified program integrity risks reported in 27 federal and state audits and investigations issued between January 2012 and September 2017; reviewed federal regulations and guidance on the PERM and CMS's Focused Program Integrity Reviews; and contacted program integrity officials in the 16 states with a majority of 2016 Medicaid spending for managed care, as well as CMS officials and program integrity experts. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) estimate of improper payments for Medicaid managed care has limitations that are not mitigated by the agency's and states' current oversight efforts. One component of the Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) measures the accuracy of capitated payments, which are periodic payments that state Medicaid agencies make to managed care organizations (MCO) to provide services to enrollees and to cover other allowable costs, such as administrative expenses. However, the managed care component of the PERM neither includes a medical review of services delivered to enrollees, nor reviews of MCO records or data. Further, GAO's review of the 27 federal and state audits and investigations identified key program risks. Ten of the 27 federal and state audits and investigations identified about $68 million in overpayments and unallowable MCO costs that were not accounted for by PERM estimates; another of these investigations resulted in a $137.5 million settlement. These audits and investigations were conducted over more than 5 years and involved a small fraction of the more than 270 MCOs operating nationwide as of September 2017. To the extent that overpayments and unallowable costs are unidentified and not removed from the cost data used to set capitation rates, they may allow inflated MCO payments and minimize the appearance of program risks in Medicaid managed care. CMS and states have taken steps to improve oversight of Medicaid managed care through updated regulations, focused reviews of states' managed care programs, and federal program integrity contractors' audits of managed care services. However, some of these efforts went into effect only recently, and others are unlikely to address the risks in managed care across all states. Furthermore, these efforts do not ensure the identification and reporting of overpayments to providers and unallowable costs by MCOs. Federal internal control standards call for agency management to identify and respond to risks. Without addressing key risks, such as the extent of overpayments and unallowable costs, CMS cannot be certain that its estimated improper payment rate for managed care (0.3 percent compared with 12.9 percent in Medicaid fee-for-service) accurately reflects program risks. The Administrator of CMS should consider and take steps to mitigate the program risks that are not measured in the PERM, such as overpayments and unallowable costs; such an effort could include actions such as revising the PERM methodology or focusing additional audit resources on managed care.

{"pred": " The Federal Reserve (the Fed) is the United States' central bank, with four primary responsibilities: conducting monetary policy, providing emergency liquidity as the lender of last resort, supervising banks and financial firms for safety and soundness, and operating payment systems. Congress delegates monetary policy to the Fed, but retains oversight to ensure the Fed adheres to its mandate of \"maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.\" The Fed defines stable prices as a long-term goal of 2% inflation, measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. While the Fed does not set a fixed goal for employment, it emphasizes the importance of assessing the maximum level of employment, acknowledging the uncertainty and potential for revision in these assessments. Monetary policy is used to stabilize business cycles in the short run and mainly affects inflation in the long run. The Fed's main tool is the federal funds rate, which influences the economy by affecting the cost of money and credit. In response to the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed cut the federal funds rate to 0-0.25%, a first-time occurrence. The recession ended in 2009, but the recovery was weaker than expected, leading the Fed to delay rate hikes. By 2015, the economy was in its seventh year, and the unemployment rate was near the Fed's estimate of full employment when the Fed began raising rates. This marked a departure from past practice, where the Fed typically raised rates within three years of the preceding recession ending. The Fed has continued to raise rates in steps since then. The Fed has stated that \"some further gradual increases in the federal funds rate\" are necessary to fulfill its mandate. The Fed describes its plans as \"data dependent,\" meaning they would be altered if actual employment or inflation deviate from its forecast. Although monetary policy is less stimulative than it was at the zero lower bound, the Fed is still adding stimulus to the economy as long as the federal funds rate is below what economists call the \"neutral rate.\" The Fed's current rate is similar to the inflation rate, meaning the real (inflation-adjusted) federal funds rate is around zero. However, the neutral rate is uncertain today. By historical standards, a zero real interest rate would be well below the neutral rate, but the neutral rate appears to have fallen following the financial crisis, so that current rates may be close to the neutral rate today. Typically, the Fed keeps rates below the neutral rate when the economy is operating", "answers": ["Congress has delegated responsibility for monetary policy to the Federal Reserve (the Fed), the nation's central bank, but retains oversight responsibilities for ensuring that the Fed is adhering to its statutory mandate of \"maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.\" To meet its price stability mandate, the Fed has set a longer-run goal of 2% inflation. The Fed's control over monetary policy stems from its exclusive ability to alter the money supply and credit conditions more broadly. Normally, the Fed conducts monetary policy by setting a target for the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks borrow and lend reserves on an overnight basis. It meets its target through open market operations, financial transactions traditionally involving U.S. Treasury securities. Beginning in 2007, the federal funds target was reduced from 5.25% to a range of 0% to 0.25% in December 2008, which economists call the zero lower bound. By historical standards, rates were kept unusually low for an unusually long time to mitigate the effects of the financial crisis and its aftermath. Starting in December 2015, the Fed has been raising interest rates and expects to gradually raise rates further. The Fed raised rates once in 2016, three times in 2017, and four times in 2018, by 0.25 percentage points each time. In light of increased economic uncertainty and financial volatility, the Fed announced in January 2019 that it would be \"patient\" before raising rates again. The Fed influences interest rates to affect interest-sensitive spending, such as business capital spending on plant and equipment, household spending on consumer durables, and residential investment. In addition, when interest rates diverge between countries, it causes capital flows that affect the exchange rate between foreign currencies and the dollar, which in turn affects spending on exports and imports. Through these channels, monetary policy can be used to stimulate or slow aggregate spending in the short run. In the long run, monetary policy mainly affects inflation. A low and stable rate of inflation promotes price transparency and, thereby, sounder economic decisions. The Fed's relative independence from Congress and the Administration has been justified by many economists on the grounds that it reduces political pressure to make monetary policy decisions that are inconsistent with a long-term focus on stable inflation. But independence reduces accountability to Congress and the Administration, and recent legislation and criticism of the Fed by the President has raised the question about the proper balance between the two. While the federal funds target was at the zero lower bound, the Fed attempted to provide additional stimulus through unsterilized purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities (MBS), a practice popularly referred to as quantitative easing (QE). Between 2009 and 2014, the Fed undertook three rounds of QE. The third round was completed in October 2014, at which point the Fed's balance sheet was $4.5 trillion—five times its precrisis size. After QE ended, the Fed maintained the balance sheet at the same level until September 2017, when it began to very gradually reduce it to a more normal size. The Fed has raised interest rates in the presence of a large balance sheet through the use of two new tools—by paying banks interest on reserves held at the Fed and by engaging in reverse repurchase agreements (reverse repos) through a new overnight facility. In January 2019, the Fed announced that it would continue using these tools to set interest rates permanently, in which case the balance sheet may not get much smaller than its current size of $4 trillion. With regard to its mandate, the Fed believes that unemployment is currently lower than the rate that it considers consistent with maximum employment, and inflation is close to the Fed's 2% goal by the Fed's preferred measure. Even after recent rate increases, monetary policy is still considered expansionary. This monetary policy stance is unusually stimulative compared with policy in this stage of previous expansions, and is being coupled with a stimulative fiscal policy (larger structural budget deficit). Debate is currently focused on how quickly the Fed should raise rates. Some contend the greater risk is that raising rates too slowly at full employment will cause inflation to become too high or cause financial instability, whereas others contend that raising rates too quickly will cause inflation to remain too low and choke off the expansion."], "all_classes": null, "length": 7241}
{"pred": " The report provides an overview of the Buy American Act of 1933, which aims to promote domestic manufacturing by giving the federal government a preference for purchasing domestic end products. The Act applies to various products, including aircraft engines and medical supplies, but does not apply to purchases for use outside the United States or contracts under the micro-purchase threshold. The Act allows for exceptions, such as when domestic products are not available or when the cost would be unreasonable. Additionally, the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 waives the Act's requirements for certain countries. The report highlights that while the federal government spends a significant amount on foreign products, the use of Buy American Act exceptions and trade agreement waivers is less than 5 percent of total federal contract obligations for end products in fiscal year 2017. The report also discusses the implementation of the Act, including the use of the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) to track procurement data. The report identifies challenges in applying the Act, such as verifying product origin information and ensuring compliance with exceptions and waivers. It also notes that data reporting errors and system limitations in FPDS-NG, which can lead to incomplete or inaccurate data.

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points. \n\nThe report is about the Buy American Act of 1933, which was enacted during the Great Depression to create and preserve jobs for American workers. The Act gives the federal government a preference to buy domestic end products. It mentions that many products the government buys, like aircraft engines and medical supplies, are end products that may be subject to the Act's requirements. However, the Act does not apply to products purchased for use outside the US or contracts under the micro-purchase threshold, which was $3,500 in fiscal year 2017. \n\nThen there are exceptions, like when the cost is unreasonable or when domestic products are not available. Also, the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 allows for waivers of the Buy American Act for certain countries. The report mentions that the Act's applicability is based on the product's origin, not the vendor's location. For example, a Finnish vendor might supply US-made products, which would be considered domestic. Conversely, a US-based vendor might supply products made in Finland,", "answers": ["The Buy American Act of 1933, as amended, is the main U.S. law promoting domestic purchasing. The Act permits agencies to buy foreign end products only under certain exceptions, such as when domestic items are not available at a reasonable cost. Further, U.S. trade agreements waive the Buy American restrictions for certain products. GAO was asked to review implementation of the Buy American Act. This report assesses the extent to which (1) the federal government procures foreign products through Buy American Act exceptions and waivers; and (2) selected agencies provide training and guidance to implement the Act. GAO reviewed laws, regulations, and policies related to the Buy American Act and analyzed data for fiscal year 2017 from FPDS-NG. GAO also analyzed a non-generalizable sample of 38 contracts from DOD, HHS, DHS, and VA—the agencies with the most obligations for products in fiscal year 2017. The 38 awards selected include a mix of foreign and domestic products, as well as dollars obligated. Finally, GAO interviewed cognizant contracting and policy officials from the selected agencies. According to data reported in the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) in fiscal year 2017, foreign end products accounted for less than 5 percent—about $7.8 billion—of federal obligations for products potentially subject to the Buy American Act. Federal agencies procured foreign products using exceptions to Buy American Act requirements, as well as through waivers or when the Buy American Act did not apply, as shown in the figure. The amount of foreign end products purchased could be greater than reported in FPDS-NG, however, due to reporting errors and system limitations. GAO found that 6 of the 38 contracts reviewed from the Departments of Defense (DOD), Health and Human Services (HHS), Homeland Security (DHS), and Veterans Affairs (VA) inaccurately recorded waiver or exception information. FPDS-NG system limitations compound these errors because it does not fully capture Buy American Act data. Among other things, the database does not always enable agencies to report the use of exceptions or waivers on contracts for both foreign and domestic products, reducing data accuracy. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is considering strategies to improve Buy American Act data. The four agencies GAO reviewed varied in their approaches to Buy American Act training and guidance. DOD reports that it will have trained more than 18,000 personnel by the end of 2018. DHS reports training almost 1,400 people—approximately 94 percent of its contracting staff—as of April 2018. Some VA courses mention the Act, but none is focused specifically on implementing its requirements. HHS does not have agency-level training or guidance on the Act. GAO found that contracting officers for the contracts it reviewed face challenges implementing Buy American Act requirements. Having specific and targeted Buy American Act guidance and training can better ensure that agencies meet the Act's requirements. GAO is recommending that OMB take steps to improve Buy American Act data and that HHS, DHS, and VA improve agency guidance and training on implementing the Act.

The report details the transition process, highlighting that NG911 systems are being implemented gradually at the state and local levels. It also discusses the challenges faced by states and localities, including insufficient funding, evolving technology and operations, and governance issues. The report highlights that federal agencies, such as NHTSA, NTIA, FCC, and DHS, have taken actions to support the implementation of NG911, including providing grants, developing cost studies, and issuing guides on technology standards and cybersecurity. The report also notes that while there is no federal mandate for NG911, the Next Generation 911 Advancement Act of 2012 requires specific actions from federal agencies. The report concludes with three recommendations for the Administrator of NHTSA: develop specific program goals and performance measures related to NG911 implementation, determine the roles and responsibilities of federal agencies participating in the National NG911 Roadmap initiative to carry out the national-level tasks over which each agency has jurisdiction, and develop an implementation plan to support the completion of the National NG911 Roadmap's national-level tasks. The report emphasizes the importance of federal leadership in addressing interoperability challenges and promoting the goal of a fully interconnected national NG911 system.

However, the nation's legacy 911 system relies on aging infrastructure that is not designed to accommodate modern communications technologies. As a result, states and localities are upgrading to NG911, which offers improved capabilities, such as the ability to process images, audio files, and video. While deploying NG911 is the responsibility of state and local entities, federal agencies also support implementation, led by NHTSA's National 911 Program, which facilitates collaboration among federal, state, and local 911 stakeholders. GAO was asked to review NG911 implementation nationwide. This report examines: (1) state and local progress and challenges in implementing NG911 and (2) federal actions to address challenges and planned next steps. GAO reviewed relevant statutes, regulations, and federal agency reports and plans. GAO also analyzed NHTSA's survey data on state 911 implementation for calendar year 2015, the most recent year for which data were available, and interviewed federal officials, state and local officials from nine states (selected to represent different regions and various phases of NG911 implementation), and officials from industry and advocacy groups. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) National 911 Program's most recent national survey on Next Generation 911 (NG911) implementation indicated that about half of states were in some phase of transition to NG911 in 2015, but that state and local progress varied. Specifically, 10 states reported that all 911 authorities in their state processed calls using NG911 systems; however, 18 states reported having no state or local NG911 transition plans in place—which may indicate these states were in the early phases of planning for the transition to NG911 or had not yet begun. GAO spoke with state and local 911 officials in 9 states, which were in various phases of implementing NG911, and found that none of the 9 selected states were accepting images, audio files, or video. State and local 911 officials identified a number of challenges to implementing NG911. Such challenges are related to funding, evolving technology and operations, and governance. For example, officials in 3 states said that the current funding they collect from telephone service subscribers may not be sufficient to support NG911's transition costs while simultaneously funding the operation of existing 911 systems. Federal agencies—including NHTSA, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the Federal Communications Commission, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security—have responsibilities to support NG911 implementation, such as through coordinating activities and administering grants, and are taking actions to assist state and local entities in addressing challenges to NG911's implementation. Such actions include developing resources, offering technical assistance, and convening stakeholders to explore emerging NG911 issues. For example, as the lead entity for coordinating federal NG911 efforts, NHTSA's National 911 Program is developing resources on NG911 topics, such as federal funding and governance structures. While the National 911 Program is taking steps to facilitate the state and local transition to NG911, the program lacks specific performance goals and measures to assess its progress. Without such goals and measures, it is not clear to what extent the program is effectively achieving its mission. In 2018, the National 911 Program plans to establish an interagency initiative tasked with creating a National NG911 Roadmap. This roadmap is intended to identify next steps for the federal government in supporting the creation of a national, interconnected NG911 system. While the National 911 Program is taking steps to develop a list of national-level tasks as part of its roadmap initiative, the program does not have a plan to identify: (1) roles or responsibilities for federal entities to carry out these tasks or (2) how the program plans to achieve the roadmap's objectives. Collaborating with the appropriate federal agencies to determine federal roles and responsibilities to carry out the roadmap's national-level tasks could reduce barriers to agencies effectively working together to achieve those tasks. Furthermore, developing an implementation plan that details how the roadmap's tasks will be achieved would place the National 911 Program in a better position to effectively lead interagency efforts to implement NG911 nationwide.

In FY2017, RRB paid about $12.5 billion in retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to around 548,000 beneficiaries. Also, around $105.4 million in unemployment and sickness benefits to about 28,000 claimants.\n\nThe report discusses the programs under RRA and RUIA, including financing, eligibility, and benefits. It also relates railroad retirement to Social Security. \n\nThe RRA provides retirement, survivor, and disability benefits. In 2017, there were 526,100 RRA beneficiaries, down from 672,400 in 2001. The average monthly benefit was about $1,986 in 2017, up from $1,043 in 2001. \n\nThe railroad retirement, disability, and survivor program is mainly funded by payroll taxes, financial interchanges from Social Security, and transfers from the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT). The remaining is from federal income taxes, interest, etc. \n\nThe payroll taxes are divided into Tier I and Tier II. Tier I is same as Social Security. Tier II is set each year based on asset balances, benefit payments,", "answers": ["The Railroad Retirement Board (RRB), an independent federal agency, administers retirement, survivor, disability, unemployment, and sickness insurance for railroad workers and their families. During FY2017, the RRB paid nearly $12.5 billion in retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to approximately 548,000 beneficiaries and paid $105.4 million in unemployment and sickness benefits to approximately 28,000 claimants. Of the total $12.5 billion benefit payments in the same fiscal year, 60.0% was paid to retired workers, 8.0% to disabled workers, 14.4% to spouses, and 16.8% to survivors. The Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) authorizes retirement, disability, and survivor benefits for railroad workers and their families. RRA is financed primarily by payroll taxes, financial interchanges from Social Security, and transfers from the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT). Railroad retirement payroll taxes have two tiers: the Tier I tax is essentially the same as the Social Security payroll tax and the Tier II tax is set each year based on the railroad retirement system's asset balances, benefit payments, and administrative costs. In FY2017, the gross RRA funding was about $12.7 billion. Railroad retirement annuities are also divided into two tiers. Tier I annuities are designed to be nearly equivalent to Social Security benefits and are based on both railroad retirement and Social Security-covered employment. However, Tier I annuities are more generous than Social Security benefits in certain situations. For example, at the age of 60, railroad workers with at least 30 years of covered railroad work may receive unreduced retirement annuities. Tier II annuities are similar to private pensions and based solely on covered railroad service. Tier II annuities are paid in addition to Tier I annuities. Railroad disability annuities may be payable to totally disabled railroad workers who are permanently disabled from all work and occupational disabled workers who are found to be permanently disabled from their regular railroad occupations. Eligible spouses and survivors of railroad workers may receive a certain portion of Tier I and Tier II benefits, but divorced spouses and surviving divorced spouses are eligible for only a certain portion of Tier I benefits. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA) authorizes unemployment and sickness benefits for railroad workers. RUIA is financed solely by railroad employers, whose contributions are based on the taxable earnings of their employees. Eligibility for railroad unemployment and sickness benefits is based on recent railroad service and earnings. The maximum daily unemployment and sickness benefit payable in the benefit year that began July 1, 2018, is $77, and the maximum benefit for a biweekly claim is $770. Normal benefits are paid for up to 26 weeks in a benefit year. The railroad unemployment and sickness system remains affected by sequestration, as unemployment benefits will continue to be reduced through at least September 30, 2019."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3573}
{"pred": " The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is responsible for providing healthcare, benefits, and memorial services to veterans and their families. It operates one of the largest healthcare delivery systems in the U.S., with over 1,500 facilities and 340,000 employees. The VA's mission is supported by three main components: the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA). VHA provides healthcare services and research, VBA provides benefits like disability compensation and life insurance, and NCA provides burial and memorial services. The VA relies heavily on its IT infrastructure to support its operations, including benefits delivery, health records access, and communication. As of October 2016, the VA had 576 active or developing IT systems, with VistA being a key system for veterans' health information. VistA, developed in-house since the 1980s, has over 200 applications, but some are outdated and costly to maintain. The VA has faced significant challenges in modernizing VistA, including unaddressed IT needs, interoperability issues, and project management problems. The department has initiated multiple modernization programs, such as HealtheVet, iEHR, VistA Evolution, and the current fourth program, which involves acquiring the same electronic health record system used by the Department of Defense (DOD). Despite efforts to improve IT management, the VA continues to face high-risk areas related to IT acquisitions and operations. The report highlights the VA's ongoing struggle to modernize its healthcare IT systems, with a focus on the VistA system, which has been in use for decades. The VA has attempted several approaches to modernize VistA, including the HealtheVet, iEHR, and VistA Evolution programs, but has not yet achieved a successful outcome. The report also discusses the VA's efforts to comply with FITARA requirements, including data center consolidation and incremental development. The VA has made progress in some areas, such as software licensing, but more work remains to ensure cost-effective and efficient use of resources to improve veterans' timely access to healthcare.\n\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy VA report. Let me start by reading through the user's provided summary and the original report to make sure I capture all the key points. \n\nThe original report is about the VA's mission, structure, and challenges with their IT systems, particularly", "answers": ["The use of IT is crucial to helping VA effectively serve the nation's veterans and, each year, the department spends billions of dollars on its information systems and assets. However, VA has faced challenges spanning a number of critical initiatives related to modernizing its major systems. To improve all major federal agencies' acquisitions and hold them accountable for reducing duplication and achieving cost savings, in December 2014 Congress enacted federal IT acquisition reform legislation (commonly referred to as the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act , or FITARA). GAO was asked to summarize its previous and ongoing work regarding VA's history of efforts to modernize VistA, including past use of contractors, and the department's recent effort to acquire a commercial electronic health record system to replace VistA. GAO was also asked to provide an update on VA's progress in key FITARA-related areas, including (1) data center consolidation and optimization, (2) incremental system development practices, and (3) software license management. VA generally agreed with the information upon which this statement is based. For nearly two decades, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has undertaken multiple efforts to modernize its health information system—the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (known as VistA). Two of VA's most recent efforts included the Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) program, a joint program with the Department of Defense (DOD) intended to replace separate systems used by VA and DOD with a single system; and the VistA Evolution program, which was to modernize VistA with additional capabilities and a better interface for all users. VA has relied extensively on assistance from contractors for these efforts. VA obligated over $1.1 billion for contracts with 138 contractors during fiscal years 2011 through 2016 for iEHR and VistA Evolution. Contract data showed that the 15 key contractors that worked on both programs accounted for $741 million of the funding obligated for system development, project management, and operations and maintenance to support the two programs (see figure). VA recently announced that it intends to change its VistA modernization approach and acquire the same electronic health record system that DOD is implementing. With respect to key FITARA-related areas, the department has reported progress on consolidating and optimizing its data centers, although this progress has fallen short of targets set by the Office of Management and Budget. VA has also reported $23.61 million in data center-related cost savings, yet does not expect to realize further savings from additional closures. In addition, VA's Chief Information Officer (CIO) certified the use of adequate incremental development for 10 of the department's major IT investments; however, VA has not yet updated its policy and process for CIO certification as GAO recommended. Finally, VA has issued a software licensing policy and has generated an inventory of its software licenses to inform future investment decisions. GAO has made multiple recommendations to VA aimed at improving the department's IT management.

{"pred": " The report discusses the impacts of climate change on migration and its potential effects on global stability and security. According to the report, climate change poses serious risks to the physical and ecological systems that society depends on, although the exact details of these impacts are uncertain. Climate change may intensify slow-onset disasters, such as drought, crop failure, and sea level rise. Climate change is also increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, including sudden-onset disasters, such as floods. These effects of climate change may alter existing migration trends across the globe. For example, sea level rise, a slow-onset disaster, may result in the salinization of soil and drinking water, thereby undermining a country or community’s ability to sustain livelihoods and maintain critical services, which could cause some people to migrate. Sudden-onset disasters may also contribute to migration as people flee natural disasters, in most cases leading to temporary displacement. For example, people may either voluntarily migrate, or be forced to migrate, to earn money needed to rebuild damaged homes after flooding, especially as extreme weather events increase in intensity and number. If unable or unwilling to migrate, people may find themselves trapped or choosing to stay in deteriorating conditions. Sources agree that the effects of climate change generally impact internal migration, while migration due to climate change is less common. In deciding whether to migrate, people weigh multiple factors including economic and political factors, social or personal motives, or demographic pressures. The effects of climate change add another layer of complexity to this decision, but there is debate about the role climate change plays in migration. The report also highlights the challenges of estimating the number of people displaced by climate change, as there are no reliable global estimates for those migrating due to slow-onset disasters, and estimates for those migrating due to sudden-onset disasters are based on limited data. The lack of reliable data is due in part to the multi-causal nature of migration. The report also notes that migration due to climate change is a potential source of instability and national security challenges. For example, an influx of migrants to a city may put pressure on existing resources, resulting in tensions between new migrants and residents, or between the population and its government. The U.S. government agencies, including the Department of State (State), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Department of Defense (DOD), have been involved in addressing climate change as a driver of migration. The report also discusses the effects of climate change on migration and its potential impact on global stability and security", "answers": ["The effects of climate change, combined with other factors, may alter human migration trends across the globe, according to the International Organization for Migration. For example, climate change can increase the frequency and intensity of natural disasters, causing populations to move from an area. Climate change can also intensify slow-onset disasters, such as drought, crop failure, or sea level rise, potentially altering longer-term migration trends. GAO was asked to review how U.S. agencies address climate change as a potential driver of global migration. For State, USAID, and DOD, this report (1) describes executive branch actions related to climate change and migration from fiscal years 2014 through 2018; (2) examines the extent to which the agencies discussed the potential effects of climate change on migration in their plans and risk assessments; and (3) describes agency activities on the issue. GAO analyzed documents on administration priorities; reviewed agency plans, risk assessments, and documentation of agency activities; and interviewed agency officials. From fiscal years 2014 through 2018, a variety of executive branch actions related to climate change—such as executive orders and strategies—affected the Department of State (State), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Department of Defense (DOD), including their activities that could potentially address the nexus of climate change and migration. For example, a fiscal year 2016 presidential memorandum—rescinded in 2017—required agencies to develop implementation plans to identify the potential impact of climate change on human mobility, among other things. In general, however, climate change as a driver of migration was not a focus of the executive branch actions. For example, a fiscal year 2014 executive order—also rescinded in 2017—requiring agencies to prepare for the impacts of climate change did not highlight migration as a particular concern. State, USAID, and DOD have discussed the potential effects of climate change on migration in agency plans and risk assessments. For example, State and USAID required climate change risk assessments when developing country and regional strategies, and a few of the strategies reviewed by GAO identified the nexus of climate change and migration as a risk. However, State changed its approach in 2017, no longer providing missions with guidance on whether and how to include climate change risks in their integrated country strategies. In doing so, State did not include in its 2018 guidance to the missions any information on how to include climate change risks, should the missions choose to do so. Without clear guidance, State may miss opportunities to identify and address issues related to climate change as a potential driver of migration. The three agencies have been involved in climate change related activities but none were specifically focused on the nexus with global migration. For example, USAID officials said that the agency's adaptation efforts, such as its Pastoralist Areas Resilience Improvement through Market Expansion project in Ethiopia, were the most likely to include activities, such as enhancing resilience, that can indirectly address the issue of climate change as a driver of migration. GAO recommends that State provide missions with guidance that clearly documents its process for climate change risk assessments for country strategies. In commenting on a draft of this report, State indicated that it would update its integrated country strategy guidance and will specifically note that missions have the option to provide additional information on climate resilience and related topics."], "all_classes": null, "length": 14011}
{"pred": " The report explores the historical and legal evolution of executive emergency powers in liberal democracies, focusing on the United States. It traces the expansion of presidential authority to manage economic and political crises, highlighting the tension between executive discretion and the rule of law. Initially, Presidents often acted unilaterally during emergencies, risking impeachment or civil liability. Over time, Congress began creating statutes that allowed the President to declare emergencies and use delegated powers. The Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA) was a key piece of legislation that gave the President extensive control over international economic transactions. However, the reforms aimed to limit these powers have not been effective. The report discusses the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which was enacted in 197 to rein in presidential emergency authority. Despite the reforms, the use of IEEPA has expanded in scale, scope, and frequency. The report also highlights the implications of these powers, including the potential for abuse and the impact on international relations. It concludes that while the legal framework for emergency powers is complex, Congress has not taken significant steps to limit or modify these powers, suggesting a potential for continued executive discretion in the face of national emergencies.\n\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report. Let me start by reading through the report again to get the main points. The report is about executive discretion, especially in times of emergency, in liberal democracies, focusing on the US. It talks about how the US Constitution is silent on emergency powers, leading to varied approaches by Congress and the President over time. \n\nIn the early 1800s, Presidents acted without congressional approval, risking personal liability. By the 20th century, Congress created statutes allowing the President to declare emergencies and use delegated powers. The Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA) was a key law that gave the President extensive control over international economic transactions. However, the reforms have not been effective. The report discusses the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which was enacted in 1977 to rein in presidential emergency authority.

It concludes that while the legal framework for emergency powers is complex, Congress has not taken significant steps to limit or modify these powers, indicating a potential for continued executive discretion during national emergencies.\n\nWait, that's a bit too", "answers": ["The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) provides the President broad authority to regulate a variety of economic transactions following a declaration of national emergency. IEEPA, like the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA) from which it branched, sits at the center of the modern U.S. sanctions regime. Changes in the use of IEEPA powers since the act's enactment in 1977 have caused some to question whether the statute's oversight provisions are robust enough given the sweeping economic powers it confers upon the President upon declaration of a state of emergency. Over the course of the twentieth century, Congress delegated increasing amounts of emergency power to the President by statute. The Trading with the Enemy Act was one such statute. Congress passed TWEA in 1917 to regulate international transactions with enemy powers following the U.S. entry into the First World War. Congress expanded the act during the 1930s to allow the President to declare a national emergency in times of peace and assume sweeping powers over both domestic and international transactions. Between 1945 and the early 1970s, TWEA became a critically important means to impose sanctions as part of U.S. Cold War strategy. Presidents used TWEA to block international financial transactions, seize U.S.-based assets held by foreign nationals, restrict exports, modify regulations to deter the hoarding of gold, limit foreign direct investment in U.S. companies, and impose tariffs on all imports into the United States. Following committee investigations that discovered that the United States had been in a state of emergency for more than 40 years, Congress passed the National Emergencies Act (NEA) in 1976 and IEEPA in 1977. The pair of statutes placed new limits on presidential emergency powers. Both included reporting requirements to increase transparency and track costs, and the NEA required the President to annually assess and extend, if appropriate, the emergency. However, some experts argue that the renewal process has become pro forma. The NEA also afforded Congress the means to terminate a national emergency by adopting a concurrent resolution in each chamber. A decision by the Supreme Court, in a landmark immigration case, however, found the use of concurrent resolutions to terminate an executive action unconstitutional. Congress amended the statute to require a joint resolution, significantly increasing the difficulty of terminating an emergency. Like TWEA, IEEPA has become an important means to impose economic-based sanctions since its enactment; like TWEA, Presidents have frequently used IEEPA to restrict a variety of international transactions; and like TWEA, the subjects of the restrictions, the frequency of use, and the duration of emergencies have expanded over time. Initially, Presidents targeted foreign states or their governments. Over the years, however, presidential administrations have increasingly used IEEPA to target individuals, groups, and non-state actors such as terrorists and persons who engage in malicious cyber-enabled activities. As of March 1, 2019, Presidents had declared 54 national emergencies invoking IEEPA, 29 of which are still ongoing. Typically, national emergencies invoking IEEPA last nearly a decade, although some have lasted significantly longer--the first state of emergency declared under the NEA and IEEPA, which was declared in response to the taking of U.S. embassy staff as hostages by Iran in 1979, may soon enter its fifth decade. IEEPA grants sweeping powers to the President to control economic transactions. Despite these broad powers, Congress has never attempted to terminate a national emergency invoking IEEPA. Instead, Congress has directed the President on numerous occasions to use IEEPA authorities to impose sanctions. Congress may want to consider whether IEEPA appropriately balances the need for swift action in a time of crisis with Congress' duty to oversee executive action. Congress may also want to consider IEEPA's role in implementing its influence in U.S. foreign policy and national security decision-making."], "all_classes": null, "length": 14753}
{"pred": " The report provides an overview of the United States' national pipeline system, which spans over 2.7 million miles and transports oil, natural gas, and hazardous liquids. The system is divided into three main categories: hazardous liquid pipelines, natural gas transmission and storage pipelines, and natural gas distribution pipelines. These pipelines are primarily located underground in the continental U.S., but also traverse remote and densely populated areas. The report highlights the criticality of certain pipelines and facilities, which are determined based on their importance to the nation's energy infrastructure, service to installations critical to national defense, or the potential to cause mass casualties and significant impact on public drinking water affecting major population centers. These critical systems are subject to increased security attention. However, the inherent design and operation of U.S. pipeline systems may reduce some potential impacts of lost service. The pipeline sector is generally considered to be resilient and versatile. Historically, pipeline operators have been able to quickly respond to the adverse consequences of an incident—whether it is damage from a major hurricane or a backhoe—and quickly restore pipeline service. Pipeline infrastructure also includes redundancies such as parallel pipelines or interconnections that enable operators to reroute material through the network. The report also discusses the vulnerabilities of the pipeline system, including physical attacks, sabotage by environmental activists, and cyber threats. It notes that pipelines are vulnerable to physical attacks due to their stationary nature, the volatility of transported products, and the dispersed nature of the pipeline networks. The report mentions that oil and gas pipelines have been and continue to be targeted by terrorists and other malicious groups globally. Although terrorists have not succeeded in attacking U.S. pipelines, the report also highlights that environmental activists and lone actors seeking to halt the construction of new pipelines through sabotage have emerged as a new threat to pipelines. For example, in March 2017, activists used blowtorches to cut holes in empty portions of the Dakota Access Pipeline in two states. In February 2017, local law enforcement officers fatally shot a man who used an assault rifle to damage the Sabal Trail Pipeline, a natural gas pipeline under construction in Florida. The report also addresses the cybersecurity risks to the pipeline system, including the increasing sophistication of cyber threats and the potential for cyber attacks to disrupt operations. According to the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center, the energy sector, including pipelines, experienced more cyber incidents than any other sector from 2013 to 2015, accounting for 35 percent of the 796 incidents reported by all critical infrastructure", "answers": ["More than 2.7 million miles of pipeline transport and distribute oil, natural gas, and other hazardous products throughout the United States. Interstate pipelines run through remote areas and highly populated urban areas, and are vulnerable to accidents, operating errors, and malicious physical and cyber-based attack or intrusion. The energy sector accounted for 35 percent of the 796 critical infrastructure cyber incidents reported to DHS from 2013 to 2015. Several federal and private entities have roles in pipeline security. TSA is primarily responsible for the oversight of pipeline physical security and cybersecurity. GAO was asked to review TSA's efforts to assess and enhance pipeline security and cybersecurity. This report examines, among other objectives: (1) the guidance pipeline operators reported using to address security risks and the extent that TSA ensures its guidelines reflect the current threat environment; (2) the extent that TSA has assessed pipeline systems' security risks; and (3) the extent TSA has assessed its effectiveness in reducing pipeline security risks. GAO analyzed TSA documents, such as its Pipeline Security Guidelines ; evaluated TSA pipeline risk assessment efforts; and interviewed TSA officials, 10 U.S. pipeline operators—selected based on volume, geography, and material transported—and representatives from five industry associations. Pipeline operators reported using a range of guidelines and standards to address physical and cybersecurity risks, including the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) Pipeline Security Guidelines , initially issued in 2011. TSA issued revised guidelines in March 2018 to reflect changes in the threat environment and incorporate most of the principles and practices from the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity . However, TSA's revisions do not include all elements of the current framework and TSA does not have a documented process for reviewing and revising its guidelines on a regular basis. Without such a documented process, TSA cannot ensure that its guidelines reflect the latest known standards and best practices for physical security and cybersecurity, or address the dynamic security threat environment that pipelines face. Further, GAO found that the guidelines lack clear definitions to ensure that pipeline operators identify their critical facilities. GAO's analysis showed that operators of at least 34 of the nation's top 100 critical pipeline systems (determined by volume of product transported) deemed highest risk had identified no critical facilities. This may be due, in part, to the guidelines not clearly defining the criteria to determine facilities' criticality. To assess pipeline security risks, TSA conducts pipeline security reviews—Corporate Security Reviews and Critical Facility Security Reviews—to assess pipeline systems' vulnerabilities. However, GAO found that the number of TSA security reviews has varied considerably over the last several years, as shown in the table on the following page. TSA officials stated that staffing limitations have prevented TSA from conducting more reviews. Staffing levels for TSA's Pipeline Security Branch have varied significantly since fiscal year 2010 with the number of staff ranging from 14 full-time equivalents in fiscal years 2012 and 2013 to 1 in 2014. Further, TSA does not have a strategic workforce plan to help ensure it identifies the skills and competencies—such as the required level of cybersecurity expertise—necessary to carry out its pipeline security responsibilities. By establishing a strategic workforce plan, TSA can help ensure that it has identified the necessary skills, competencies, and staffing. GAO also identified factors that likely limit the usefulness of TSA's risk assessment methodology for prioritizing pipeline system reviews. Specifically, TSA has not updated its risk assessment methodology since 2014 to reflect current threats to the pipeline industry. Further, its sources of data and underlying assumptions and judgments regarding certain threat and vulnerability inputs are not fully documented. In addition, the risk assessment has not been peer reviewed since its inception in 2007. Taking steps to strengthen its risk assessment, and initiating an independent, external peer review would provide greater assurance that TSA ranks relative risk among pipeline systems using comprehensive and accurate data and methods. TSA has established performance measures to monitor pipeline security review recommendations, analyze their results, and assess effectiveness in reducing risks. However, these measures do not possess key attributes—such as clarity, and having measurable targets—that GAO has found are key to successful performance measures. By taking steps to ensure that its pipeline security program performance measures exhibit these key attributes, TSA could better assess its effectiveness at reducing pipeline systems' security risks. Pipeline Security Branch officials also reported conducting security reviews as the primary means for assessing the effectiveness of TSA's efforts to reduce pipeline security risks. However, TSA has not tracked the status of Corporate Security Review recommendations for the past 5 years. Until TSA monitors and records the status of these reviews' recommendations, it will be hindered in its efforts to determine whether its recommendations are leading to significant reduction in risk. GAO makes 10 recommendations to TSA to improve its pipeline security program management (many are listed on the next page), and DHS concurred. GAO recommends, among other things, that the TSA Administrator take the following actions: implement a documented process for reviewing, and if deemed necessary, for revising TSA's Pipeline Security Guidelines at defined intervals; clarify TSA's Pipeline Security Guidelines by defining key terms within its criteria for determining critical facilities; develop a strategic workforce plan for TSA's Security Policy and Industry Engagement‘s Surface Division; update TSA's pipeline risk assessment methodology to include current data to ensure it reflects industry conditions and threats; fully document the data sources, underlying assumptions and judgments that form the basis of TSA's pipeline risk assessment methodology; take steps to coordinate an independent, external peer review of TSA's pipeline risk assessment methodology; ensure the Security Policy and Industry Engagement‘s Surface Division has a suite of performance measures which exhibit key attributes of successful performance measures; and enter information on Corporate Security Review recommendations and monitor and record their status."], "all_classes": null, "length": 15361}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy government report. Let me start by reading through the report to understand the main points. The report is about the U.S. global defense posture, specifically focusing on the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) and its implications. \n\nFirst, the report explains that global defense posture is crucial for U.S. military operations and communicating strategic interests. It's managed through DOD Instruction 3000.12, which includes three elements: forces, footprint, and agreements. EUCOM is one of the six combatant commands responsible for Europe and parts of Asia and the Middle East. \n\nThen, there's a discussion about the reduction in U.S. military presence in Europe since the Cold War, with some brigades deactivated by 2014. As of 2016, there were some forces and personnel. Then, the report talks about DOD's efforts to estimate and report the total cost of global defense posture. There were issues with cost data in key documents, leading to recommendations for better cost analysis. DOD agreed and took steps, but some issues remained. \n\nThen, the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) is part of the DOD's efforts to enhance posture in Europe. EUCOM identified five lines of effort under ERI. Three of these lines are expected to enhance DOD's posture. For example, rotating armored brigades and elements of a combat aviation brigade to Europe every nine months. Also, enhancing infrastructure. And negotiating host nation agreements. \n\nThe report also mentions that since 209, DOD has been trying to improve cost estimation. In 201, EUCOM lacked comprehensive cost data. In 2012, DOD had not fully estimated the cost implications of two initiatives in Europe. The report highlights that DOD has requested increased funding for ERI, but the processes are not aligned with the established posture planning processes. \n\nThere are recommendations for the Secretary of Defense to prioritize ERI initiatives relative to base budget initiatives, develop sustainment cost estimates, and provide future cost estimates to Congress. \n\nThe report also discusses the challenges in estimating the long-term costs of ERI initiatives, the lack of visibility into the funding of these projects, and the potential for increased fiscal risk. \n\nI need to condense all this into a one-page summary. Let me structure it: \n\n1. Introduction: Global defense posture and its importance.\n2. Components", "answers": ["In response to Russia's annexation of Crimea in March 2014, the President announced the ERI, to reassure allies in Europe of U.S. commitment to their security. This initiative has been funded using OCO appropriations, which Congress provides in addition to DOD's base budget appropriations. The Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the Continuing Appropriations and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017, included a provision for GAO to review matters related to ERI. In this report, we (1) describe changes in ERI's objectives, funding under ERI, and DOD's posture in Europe since 2014 and (2) evaluate the extent to which DOD's planning processes for posture initiatives funded under ERI prioritize those initiatives, estimate their long-term costs, and communicate their estimated costs to Congress. GAO analyzed DOD strategy documentation, budget and cost analysis guidance, budget justification materials, and cost and obligations data. GAO also interviewed knowledgeable officials within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, U.S. European Command, the military services, and the State Department. Since 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) has expanded the European Reassurance Initiative's (ERI) objectives, increased its funding, and planned enhancements to European posture. DOD expanded ERI's objectives from the short-term reassurance of allies and partners to include deterring Russian aggression in the long term and developing the capacity to field a credible combined force should deterrence fail. With respect to funding, DOD will have requested approximately $4.5 billion for ERI's posture enhancements through the end of fiscal year 2017 (about $3.2 billion for fiscal year 2017 alone), and in July 2016 EUCOM identified funding needs for future posture initiatives. The expansion of ERI's objectives has contributed to DOD's enhancing its posture in Europe. Specifically, DOD has increased the size and duration of Army combat unit deployments, planned to preposition Army equipment in Eastern Europe, added new enduring locations (e.g., locations that DOD expects to access and use to support U.S. security interests for the foreseeable future), improved infrastructure, and negotiated new agreements with European nations. As of April 2017, DOD was considering further force enhancements under ERI as part of the department's ERI budget request. DOD also was reviewing whether new enduring locations to support ERI were needed and was considering other improvements to existing infrastructure. DOD's process for planning ERI has not established priorities among posture initiatives funded under ERI relative to those in its base budget, nor estimated long-term sustainment costs for some posture initiatives funded under ERI, nor communicated future costs to Congress. ERI is being planned using a separate process from DOD's established processes and is funded from DOD's overseas contingency operations (OCO) appropriations. GAO found several weaknesses: Lack of prioritization : DOD establishes priorities among ERI posture initiatives but has not evaluated them against base budget initiatives using its posture management process. As a result, DOD lacks an understanding of the relative importance of ERI initiatives and may be investing in projects that it will not continue should OCO funding become unavailable. Lack of sustainment costs : EUCOM and the military services have not fully estimated the long-term costs to sustain equipment and construction funded under ERI. Based on DOD's approach for calculating rough order sustainment costs, GAO determined that these costs could be substantial. DOD officials said that GAO correctly applied DOD's approach for estimating sustainment costs, but noted that actual costs may be lower, because the military services may not fully fund sustainment. In the absence of comprehensive estimates, DOD has been limited in its ability to assess affordability and plan for future costs. Not communicating future costs : DOD limits Congress's visibility into the resources needed to implement ERI and achieve its objectives because it does not include future costs in its ERI budget request. This is a public version of a classified report issued in August 2017. Information on specific posture planning, guidance, and budget estimates that DOD deemed to be classified have been omitted from this report. GAO recommends that DOD prioritize ERI posture initiatives against initiatives in its base budget, develop cost estimates for sustaining initiatives, and communicate future costs to Congress.

{"pred": " (One page, 500 words)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy government report. Let me start by reading through the report to understand the main points. The report is about Medicaid spending on long-term care, specifically focusing on assisted living facilities. \n\nFirst, the report mentions that Medicaid spending on long-term care has been increasing, from $146 billion in 2013 to $158 billion in 2015. That's a significant jump. The key point here is that long-term care services provided in home and community settings, like assisted living facilities, cost more than those in institutional settings like nursing homes. \n\nThen there's a part about Medicaid coverage of services in assisted living facilities. The Medicaid statute doesn't cover room and board charges. So, states have their own programs, but federal oversight is done by CMS. \n\nThe report also talks about the roles of CMS and states in Medicaid oversight. CMS issues regulations, approves changes, provides technical assistance, collects data, and reviews programs. States handle day-to-day administration, including monitoring HCBS programs. Each state has a designated agency, which may delegate some functions to other agencies. \n\nThen there's a section about the different types of HCBS programs, like HCBS waivers, which have more stringent federal requirements. \n\nThe report then goes into detail about the spending on assisted living services, which is part of the Medicaid HCBS programs. It mentions that in 2014, 48 states spent about $10 billion on assisted living services, with the average per beneficiary being around $30,000. \n\nThere's a part about the different types of services provided, like assistance with daily living activities, medication administration, and meal coordination. \n\nThen there's a discussion about the oversight of assisted living services, including the types of information reviewed and the extent to which state Medicaid agencies are involved in that oversight. \n\nThe report also includes a survey of state Medicaid agencies regarding coverage, spending, enrollment, and oversight of assisted living services in 2014. \n\nThen there's a section about the different types of programs that states use to cover assisted living services, including HCBS waivers. \n\nThe report then outlines the six requirements that states must demonstrate for their HCBS waiver programs. \n\nThen there's a part about the CMS oversight of these programs through annual reports and renewal reports. \n\nThe report also discusses the challenges in accessing assisted living services, such as limited facilities willing", "answers": ["The number of individuals receiving long term care services from Medicaid in community residential settings is expected to grow. These settings, which include assisted living facilities, provide a range of services that allow aged and disabled beneficiaries, who might otherwise require nursing home care, to remain in the community. State Medicaid programs and CMS, the federal agency responsible for overseeing the state programs, share responsibility for ensuring that beneficiaries' health and welfare is protected. GAO was asked to examine state and federal oversight of assisted living services in Medicaid. This report (1) describes state spending on and coverage of these services, (2) describes how state Medicaid agencies oversee the health and welfare of beneficiaries in these settings, and (3) examines the extent that CMS oversees state Medicaid agency monitoring of assisted living services. GAO surveyed all state Medicaid agencies and interviewed officials in a nongeneralizeable sample of three states with varied oversight processes for their assisted living programs. GAO reviewed regulations and guidance, and interviewed CMS officials. State Medicaid agencies in 48 states that covered assisted living services reported spending more than $10 billion (federal and state) on assisted living services in 2014. These 48 states reported covering these services for more than 330,000 beneficiaries through more than 130 different programs. Most programs were operated under Medicaid waivers that allow states to target certain populations, limit enrollment, or restrict services to certain geographic areas. With respect to oversight of their largest assisted living programs, state Medicaid agencies reported varied approaches to overseeing beneficiary health and welfare, particularly in how they monitored critical incidents involving beneficiaries receiving assisted living services. State Medicaid agencies are required to protect beneficiary health and welfare and operate systems to monitor for critical incidents—cases of potential or actual harm to beneficiaries such as abuse, neglect, or exploitation. Twenty-six state Medicaid agencies could not report to GAO the number of critical incidents that occurred in assisted living facilities, citing reasons including the inability to track incidents by provider type (9 states), lack of a system to collect critical incidents (9 states), and lack of a system that could identify Medicaid beneficiaries (5 states). State Medicaid agencies varied in what types of critical incidents they monitored. All states identified physical, emotional, or sexual abuse as a critical incident. A number of states did not identify other incidents that may indicate potential harm or neglect such as medication errors (7 states) and unexplained death (3 states). State Medicaid agencies varied in whether they made information on critical incidents and other key information available to the public. Thirty-four states made critical incident information available to the public by phone, website, or in person, while another 14 states did not have such information available at all. Oversight of state monitoring of assisted living services by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is limited by gaps in state reporting. States are required to annually report to CMS information on deficiencies affecting beneficiary health and welfare for the most common program used to provide assisted living services. However, states have latitude in what they consider a deficiency. States also must describe their systems for monitoring critical incidents, but CMS does not require states to annually report data from their systems. Under federal internal control standards, agencies should have processes to identify information needed to achieve objectives and address risk. Without clear guidance on reportable deficiencies and no requirement to report critical incidents, CMS may be unaware of problems. For example, CMS found, after an in-depth review in one selected state seeking to renew its program, that the state lacked an effective system for assuring beneficiary health and welfare, including reporting insufficient information on the number of unexpected or suspicious beneficiary deaths. The state had not reported any deficiencies in annual reports submitted to CMS in 5 prior years. GAO recommendations to CMS include clarifying state requirements for reporting program deficiencies and requiring annual reporting of critical incidents. HHS concurred with GAO's recommendations to clarify deficiency reporting and stated that it would consider annual reporting requirements for critical incidents after completing an ongoing review."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6063}
{"pred": " The report outlines the regulatory frameworks and oversight mechanisms for rail transportation safety in the United States, focusing on the roles of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). FRA oversees safety on the general railroad system, which includes freight railroads and intercity passenger and commuter railroads. FTA is responsible for rail transit systems, which serve individual metropolitan areas and use track not shared with freight or other passenger trains. Rail transit includes various modes like heavy and light rail, streetcars, etc., and provided over 4.4 billion passenger trips in 2016. The report highlights the challenges in state-based rail transit safety oversight, including insufficient staff, training, and resources. It discusses the Federal Transit Administration's (FTA) state safety oversight program, which requires states to establish independent agencies with investigative and enforcement powers. The program has been criticized for lacking guidance on developing risk-based inspection programs and for not having a process to evaluate the effectiveness of state enforcement practices. The report also details the changes in the rail transit safety oversight program, including the establishment of a triennial review process. The report discusses the Public Transportation Safety Program, which was established by the MAP-21 Act, and the FAST Act. The report also examines the development of safety regulations by both agencies, noting that FRA has a more centralized approach for railroads, while FTA is working to establish federal safety regulations for rail transit. The report also highlights the importance of rail transit in the nation's transportation network, particularly in large metropolitan areas. It also discusses the need for federal rail transit safety regulations to ensure consistent safety practices across the industry. The report concludes with two recommendations to FTA: (1) Develop a plan with a timeline for providing guidance to state safety agencies on implementing risk-based inspection programs. (2) Develop and communicate a method for how FTA will monitor the effectiveness of state safety agencies' enforcement practices. The report also mentions that the report was shared with the Department of Transportation (DOT), the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and WMATA for review and comment. The final report will be available on the GAO website and will be sent to the appropriate congressional committees and the Secretary of Transportation.\n\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points. \n\nThe report is about the regulation of rail transportation safety in the US, specifically the roles of FRA and FTA. FRA is responsible for safety", "answers": ["In 2012 and 2015, DOT was provided with additional authority to oversee the safety of rail transit. Within DOT, FTA is now implementing this authority. The DOT's Office of Inspector General has reported, though, that FTA faces challenges in carrying out its enhanced safety oversight. FRA, also in DOT, has long carried out safety oversight of freight, intercity passenger, and commuter railroads. GAO was asked to review various rail safety and oversight issues, including the differences between FRA's and FTA's rail safety oversight programs. This report examines (1) key characteristics of FRA's and FTA's rail safety oversight programs and (2) strengths and limitations of FRA's and FTA's rail safety oversight programs. GAO assessed FRA's and FTA's information about rail safety oversight activities against guidance from the Office of Management and Budget, leading practices developed by the transit industry, and federal standards for internal control. GAO also interviewed stakeholders, including rail operators chosen based on mode, size, and location. The Department of Transportation's (DOT) Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and Federal Transit Administration (FTA) carry out different approaches to rail safety oversight. FRA has a more centralized safety oversight program for railroads, while FTA's program for oversight of rail transit safety largely relies on state safety agencies to monitor and enforce rail transit safety, as established in federal statute. Key characteristics of both programs include: (1) safety regulations, (2) inspections and other oversight activities, and (3) enforcement mechanisms to ensure that safety deficiencies are addressed (see figure). There are strengths and limitations to FRA's and FTA's approaches to their safety oversight missions, including how the two agencies develop safety regulations, conduct inspections, and carry out enforcement. The National Transportation Safety Board has reported, and stakeholders GAO spoke with generally agreed, that strengths of FRA's rail safety oversight program include its safety regulations, its risk-based inspection program, and its enforcement authorities. FRA also has potential limitations in its oversight framework, though, such as difficulty evaluating the effectiveness of its enforcement mechanisms. FTA has made some progress implementing changes to the rail transit safety program. However, FTA has not provided all the necessary guidance and support to states' safety agencies to ensure they develop appropriate and effective rail transit safety inspection programs. In particular, FTA has not provided states with guidance on how to develop and implement risk-based inspection programs. Though FTA has said that it will develop such guidance, it does not have a plan or timeline to do so. Without guidance from FTA on how to develop and carry out risk-based inspections, state safety agencies may not allocate their limited resources efficiently, and important safety issues may go undetected. In addition, FTA has not developed a process or methodology to evaluate whether state safety agency enforcement authorities and practices are effective. Without clear evidence that state safety agencies' enforcement is effective, states and FTA may not be able to compel rail transit operators to remedy safety deficiencies. As a result, deficiencies may remain for long periods, potentially contributing to safety incidents. GAO recommends that FTA (1) create a plan, with timeline, for developing risk-based inspection guidance for state safety agencies, and (2) develop and communicate a method for how FTA will monitor whether state safety agencies' enforcement practices are effective. DOT agreed with our recommendations. DOT, NTSB, and WMATA provided technical comments that we incorporated as appropriate."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8086}
{"pred": " The report discusses NASA's Commercial Crew Program, a multi-phase initiative launched in 2010 to develop crew transportation systems for the International Space Station (ISS). Initially, NASA used Space Act Agreements, which are more flexible than Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) contracts, to engage companies like Boeing and SpaceX. These agreements allowed for greater flexibility and less regulatory oversight. As the program advanced, NASA transitioned to FAR-based contracts, which enabled the procurement of missions to the ISS, while still providing technical support and funding. The program requires contractors to meet ISS program requirements and Commercial Crew Program requirements, which focus on system capabilities and safety. The certification process involves multiple stages, including design certification reviews and a verification closure notice process, where contractors submit data to verify they have met all requirements to be certified. In 2014, NASA awarded Boeing and SpaceX contracts for the Commercial Crew Transportation Capability phase, with Boeing receiving up to $4.2 billion and SpaceX up to $2.6 billion. These contracts include various services, such as design, development, testing, and evaluation work, service missions, and special studies. The contractors have made progress, but both have delayed their certification milestones to early 2019. The report highlights the risks of further delays in the contractors' schedules, which could disrupt U.S. access to the ISS. NASA has not fully shared this information with Congress, leaving them without insight into potential delays. The program has mechanisms to assess safety throughout the certification process, but these mechanisms are at varying stages of completion. The report also discusses the challenges in assessing and evaluating all deliverables in a timely manner. NASA has not developed a contingency plan to ensure uninterrupted access to the ISS after 2019. The report recommends that NASA include the results of its schedule risk analysis in its quarterly reports to Congress. Additionally, NASA should develop a contingency plan to ensure a U.S. presence on the ISS beyond 2019. The report also addresses the safety of the crew. NASA's certification process includes a loss of crew metric, which captures the probability of death or disability to a crew member. However, the approach to this metric is inconsistent, and there is no identified plan to share lessons learned from using this metric as a safety threshold. The report concludes that NASA must balance safety with acceptable risk for human spaceflight. The certification process for each contractor's spacecraft involves multiple stages, including design certification reviews and a verification closure notice process, where contractors submit data to verify they have met all requirements to", "answers": ["In 2014, NASA awarded two firm-fixed-price contracts to Boeing and SpaceX, worth a combined total of up to $6.8 billion, to develop crew transportation systems and conduct initial missions to the ISS. In February 2017, GAO found that both contractors had made progress, but their schedules were under mounting pressure. The contractors were originally required to provide NASA all the evidence it needed to certify that their systems met its requirements by 2017. A House report accompanying H.R. 5393 included a provision for GAO to review the progress of NASA's human exploration programs. This report examines the Commercial Crew Program, including (1) the extent to which the contractors have made progress towards certification and (2) how NASA's certification process addresses safety of the contractors' crew transportation systems. GAO analyzed contracts, schedules, and other documentation and spoke with officials from NASA, the Commercial Crew Program, Boeing, SpaceX, and two of NASA's independent review bodies that provide oversight. Both of the Commercial Crew Program's contractors, Boeing and Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX), are making progress finalizing designs and building hardware for their crew transportation systems, but both contractors continue to delay their certification milestone (see figure). Certification is the process that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will use to ensure that each contractor's system meets its requirements for human spaceflight for the Commercial Crew Program. Further delays are likely as the Commercial Crew Program's schedule risk analysis shows that the certification milestone is likely to slip. The analysis identifies a range for each contractor, with an earliest and latest possible completion date, as well as an average. The average certification date was December 2019 for Boeing and January 2020 for SpaceX, according to the program's April 2018 analysis. Since the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011, the United States has been relying on Russia to carry astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS). Additional delays could result in a gap in U.S. access to the space station as NASA has contracted for seats on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft only through November 2019. NASA is considering potential options, but it does not have a contingency plan for ensuring uninterrupted U.S. access. NASA's certification process addresses the safety of the contractors' crew transportation systems through several mechanisms, but there are factors that complicate the process. One of these factors is the loss of crew metric that was put in place to capture the probability of death or permanent disability to an astronaut. NASA has not identified a consistent approach for how to assess loss of crew. As a result, officials across NASA have multiple ways of assessing the metric that may yield different results. Consequently, the risk tolerance level that NASA is accepting with loss of crew varies based upon which entity is presenting the results of its assessment. Federal internal controls state that management should define risk tolerances so they are clear and measurable. Without a consistent approach for assessing the metric, the agency as a whole may not clearly capture or document its risk tolerance with respect to loss of crew. GAO is making five recommendations, including that NASA develop a contingency plan for ensuring a U.S. presence on the ISS and clarify how it will determine its risk tolerance for loss of crew. NASA concurred with three recommendations; partially concurred on the recommendation related to loss of crew; and non-concurred with a recommendation to report its schedule analysis to Congress. GAO believes these recommendations remain valid, as discussed in the report."], "all_classes": null, "length": 9763}

The report is about the appointment processes of various legislative branch agencies and entities. There are eight agencies mentioned, each with different appointment methods. The first four are appointed by the President with Senate advice and consent. Then the next two are appointed by Congress, the next by the Librarian of Congress, and the last by a board of directors. \n\nCongress has looked into these procedures to ensure accountability and protect Congress's prerogatives under the Constitution's Appointments Clause. There have been various legislative proposals over the years to change these processes. Some aim to remove the President from the appointment process for certain positions, which raises questions about constitutional interpretation, the definition of \"officer of the United States,\" and the implications for the powers and duties of these agency leaders. \n\nThe report also discusses specific examples, like the Architect of the Capitol, whose appointment was changed in 1990 to include a commission. Before that, the President had unlimited terms. The report mentions legislation from the 111th and 115th Congresses that tried to shift the appointment authority to congressional leaders and committees. \n\nThere's a lot of detail about each agency's appointment process, terms, reappointment or removal provisions, salaries, and recent appointments. For example, the Architect is appointed by the President with Senate advice and consent for a 10-year term. The Comptroller General is appointed by the President with Senate advice and consent for a 15-year term. The Government Publishing Office is appointed by the President with Senate advice and consent, but with no set term. \n\nThe report also touches on the Register of Copyrights, with proposed changes to make it a presidential appointment. \n\nI need to condense all this into a one-page summary.

{"pred": " \n\nThe report discusses the role of banks in the U.S. economy, highlighting their importance in connecting borrowers to savers and allocating funds. It acknowledges the inherent risks of banking, such as extending credit and taking liabilities, which can lead to societal and economic benefits, but also potential losses from banking panics and failures. Over time, a regulatory system has developed to balance the benefits and risks of banking. The 207-209 financial crisis threatened the collapse of the financial system and the real economy, leading to significant government interventions. This crisis revealed weaknesses in the pre-crisis regulatory regime, prompting numerous regulatory changes, including the Dodd-Frank Act. The report outlines the key issues related to banking, including prudential regulation, consumer protection, community banks, large banks, and the impact of market trends and economic conditions. It discusses the changes in regulation, such as the Basel III Accords, and the subsequent regulatory relief measures, such as the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. The report also examines the debate over the balance between consumer protection, credit access, and industry costs. It highlights the importance of banks in providing safe and affordable financial services, and the challenges faced by community banks in maintaining their presence in the industry. The report provides an overview of the selected banking-related issues, including \"safety and soundness\" regulation, consumer financial protection, community banks, large banks, and recent market and economic trends. It notes that the banking sector is undergoing transformation, with the implementation of new regulations and the emergence of fintech, as well as changes in interest rates, all of which are affecting the banking industry. The report is intended to give a concise background and analyses of certain prominent issues that have been the subject of recent discussion and debate. It also provides a list of Congressional Research Service reports that examine specific issues.

It covers the key issues related to banking, including prudential regulation, consumer protection, community banks, large banks, and the", "answers": ["Regulation of the banking industry has undergone substantial changes over the past decade. In response to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, many new bank regulations were implemented pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act; P.L. 111-203) or under the existing authorities of bank regulators to address apparent weaknesses in the regulatory regime. While some observers view those changes as necessary and effective, others argued that certain regulations were unjustifiably burdensome. To address those concerns, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-174) relaxed certain regulations. Opponents of that legislation argue it unnecessarily pared back important safeguards, but proponents of deregulation argue additional pare backs are needed. Meanwhile, a variety of economic and technological trends continue to affect banks. As a result, the 116th Congress faces many issues related to banking, including the following: Safety and Soundness. Banks are subject to regulations designed to reduce the likelihood of bank failures. Examples include requirements to hold a certain amount of capital (which enables a bank to absorb losses without failing) and the so-called Volcker Rule (a ban on banks' proprietary trading). In addition, anti-money laundering requirements aim to reduce the likelihood banks will execute transactions involving criminal proceeds. Banks are also required to take steps to avoid becoming victims of cyberattacks. The extent to which these regulations (i) are effective, and (ii) appropriately balance benefits and costs is a matter of debate. Consumer Protection, Fair Lending, and Access to Banking. Certain laws are designed to protect consumers and ensure that lenders use fair lending practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has authorities to regulate for consumer protection. No consensus exists on whether current regulations strike an appropriate balance between protecting consumers while ensuring access to credit and justifiable compliance costs. In addition, whether Community Reinvestment Act regulations as currently implemented effectively and efficiently encourage banks to provide services in their areas of operation is an open question. Large Banks and \"Too Big To Fail.\" Regulators also regulate for systemic risks, such as those associated with very large and complex financial institutions that may contribute to systemic instability. Dodd-Frank Act provisions include enhanced prudential regulation for certain large banks and changes to resolution processes in the event one fails. In addition, bank regulators imposed additional capital requirements on certain large, complex banks. Subsequently, some argued that certain of these additional regulations were too broadly applied and overly stringent. In response, Congress reduced the applicability of the Dodd-Frank measures and regulators have proposed changes to the capital rules. Whether relaxing these rules will provide needed relief to these banks or unnecessarily pare back important safeguards is a debated issue. Community Banks. The number of small or \"community\" banks has declined substantially in recent decades. No consensus exists on the degree to which regulatory burden, market forces, and the removal of regulatory barriers to interstate branching and banking are causing the decline. What Companies Should Be Eligible for Bank Charters. To operate legally as a bank, an institution must hold a charter granted by a state or federal government. Traditionally, these are held by companies generally focused on and led by people with experience in finance. However, recently companies with a focus on technology are interested in having legal status as a bank, either through a charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or a state-level industrial loan company charter. Policymakers disagree over whether allowing these companies to operate as banks would create appropriately regulated providers of financial services or inappropriately extend government-backed bank safety nets and disadvantage existing banks. Recent Market and Economic Trends. Changing economic forces also pose issues for the banking industry. Some observers argue that increases in regulation could drive certain financial activities into a relatively lightly regulated \"shadow banking\" sector. Innovative financial technology may alter the way certain financial services are delivered. If interest rates rise, it could create opportunities and risks. Such trends could have implications for how the financial system performs and influence debates over appropriate banking regulations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12828}
{"pred": " \n\nColombia, a country with a rich history and diverse population, has experienced a prolonged internal conflict that lasted over five decades. This conflict, which has caused significant human suffering and displacement, was officially declared over in August 2017 by President Juan Manuel Santos, following the disarmament of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The conflict resulted in the deaths of approximately 220,000 Colombians, with 81% of these being civilians. The conflict also led to the displacement of over 5 million Colombians, the kidnapping of 27,000 people, and the use of anti-personnel land mines by the FARC. Despite the extensive damage, Colombia has made significant progress in reducing violence, promoting economic growth, and enhancing security. The country has become one of Latin America's most attractive locations for foreign direct investment. However, the economy has faced challenges, including dependence on oil and other commodity exports, which have led to economic slowdowns. The peace process, which involved extensive negotiations between the government and the FARC, was a major achievement of the Santos presidency. The peace agreement, which was initially rejected in a national plebiscus, was later modified and approved by the Colombian Congress. The agreement addressed several key areas, including rural development, political participation, demobilization, drug trafficking, and justice for victims. However, the implementation of the peace accord has been complicated by various factors, including political polarization, resource constraints, and the need for long-term investment. The peace process has been supported by the international community, including the United Nations and the United States. The country has also faced challenges from the ongoing conflict with drug trafficking and the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, which has led to an increase in migration. The report highlights the complex history of Colombia, the impact of the conflict, and the progress made in achieving peace and stability. \n\n(Note: The summary provided is a placeholder and may not accurately reflect the content of the report. The actual summary should be written based on the content of the report.)\n\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this detailed report about Colombia's internal conflict. Let me start by reading through the report carefully to understand the key points.\n\nThe report begins by introducing Colombia as one of the oldest democracies in the Western Hemisphere and the third most populous Latin American country. It mentions that Colombia endured a multisided civil conflict for over five decades until President Juan Manuel Santos declared the conflict over in August 2017.", "answers": ["A key U.S. ally in the Latin American region, Colombia endured an internal armed conflict for half a century. Drug trafficking fueled the violence by funding both left-wing and right-wing armed groups. Some analysts feared Colombia would become a failed state in the late 1990s, but the Colombian government devised a new security strategy, known as Plan Colombia, to counter the insurgencies. Originally designed as a 6-year program, Plan Colombia ultimately became a 17-year U.S.-Colombian bilateral effort. The partnership focused initially on counternarcotics and later on counterterrorism; it then broadened to include sustainable development, human rights, trade, regional security, and many other areas of cooperation. Between FY2000 and FY2016, the U.S. Congress appropriated more than $10 billion to help fund Plan Colombia and its follow-on programs. For FY2018, Congress appropriated $391.3 million in foreign aid for Colombia, including assistance to promote peace and end the conflict. President Juan Manuel Santos (2010-2018) made concluding a peace accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)—the country's largest leftist guerrilla organization—his government's primary focus. Following four years of formal peace negotiations, Colombia's Congress ratified the FARC-government peace accord in November 2016. During a U.N.-monitored demobilization effort in 2017, approximately 11,000 FARC disarmed and demobilized. This figure included FARC who had been held in prison for crimes of rebellion and those making up FARC militias, who were accredited by the Colombian government as eligible to demobilize. On August 7, 2018, Iván Duque, a senator from the conservative Democratic Center party, was inaugurated to a four-year presidential term. Duque, who also worked at the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington, DC, and is Colombia's youngest president in a century, campaigned as a critic of the peace accord with the FARC. His party objected to specific measures concerning justice and political representation. Some observers maintain that his election has generated uncertainty for implementation of the accord. Shortly after taking office, Duque suspended peace talks with the National Liberation Army (ELN), the country's second-largest rebel group, which had begun under President Santos. Since the ratification of the peace accord, Colombia's long-term strategy has evolved from defeating insurgents to post-conflict stabilization. Many considered Plan Colombia and its successor strategies a remarkable advance, given the country's improvements in security and economic stability. Nevertheless, recent developments have called into question Colombia's progress. The FARC's demobilization has triggered open conflict among armed actors (including FARC dissidents and transnational criminal groups), which seek to control drug cultivation and trafficking, illegal mining, and other illicit businesses that the demobilized FARC abandoned. The ongoing lack of governance in remote rural areas recalls the conditions that originally gave rise to the FARC and other armed groups. Many observers continue to raise concerns about the country's human-rights conditions, sharp increases in coca cultivation and cocaine production, and problems stemming from the failing authoritarian government of neighboring Venezuela, which shares a nearly 1,400-mile border with Colombia. Venezuela's humanitarian crisis has set in motion an exodus of migrants, many of whom have sought temporary residence (or extended stays) in Colombia. Political upheaval has added yet more uncertainty after the United States and many other Western Hemisphere and European nations, including Colombia, called for a democratic transition in Venezuela and recognized the president of the Venezuelan National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, as the country's interim president in January 2019. The U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement went into force in May 2012. The United States remains Colombia's top trade partner. After several years of annual growth exceeding 4%, one of the steadiest expansion rates in the region, Colombia grew by an estimated 2.7% in 2018. The FARC-government peace accord is projected to cost more than $40 billion to implement over 15 years, adding to the polarization over the controversial peace process.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report is about the Commercial Space Launch Act Amendments of 1988 and how the FAA handles indemnification for third-party damages from space launches. The main goal of the act was to create a competitive environment for the U.S. commercial space industry. The FAA provides federal indemnification for third-party damages, but the report points out some issues with the methodology.\n\nFirst, the FAA uses a method called the risk profile method, which simulates various scenarios to estimate potential casualties. They also changed the factor for property damage from 50% to 25%. However, the report mentions that the FAA hasn't fully addressed the requirements under the Commercial Space Launch Act (CSLCA). \n\nThe report discusses the FAA's process for determining the Maximum Possible Loss (MPL) value for a launch or reentry. They use three elements: number of casualties, cost of casualties, and property damage. The FAA has revised some parts of their methodology since 2012, like the risk profile method. But there are still some weaknesses. For example, the cost of a casualty hasn't been updated since 1988, and the method for estimating property damage from casualty estimates is not always appropriate. \n\nThe FAA's current methodology includes estimating casualties, calculating the cost of casualties, and deriving property damage from casualty costs. However, the FAA hasn't updated the cost of a casualty, which is a key component. The report also mentions that the FAA has not fully addressed the requirements under CSLCA. \n\nThe FAA's methodology has some components that need improvement. For example, the risk profile method uses different tools to simulate a range of possible scenarios, creating a distribution of potential casualty numbers and the simulated probability of different levels of casualty numbers. This replaced the overlay method, which didn't work well for small launch vehicles in remote areas or reentries. \n\nThe FAA has made some changes, like reducing the factor for property damage. However, the FAA hasn't updated the cost of a casualty, which is a significant issue. \n\nThe report also highlights that the FAA hasn't evaluated the direct costs to both the industry and the government. They have not consulted with the industry on the cost-of-casualty. \n\nThe FAA has made some improvements, but important actions remain incomplete. \n\nThe report makes four recommendations to the FAA. \n\nSo", "answers": ["The federal government shares liability risks with the commercial space launch industry for accidents that result in damages to third parties or federal property. This arrangement requires space launch companies to have a specific amount of insurance to cover these damages. The government is potentially liable for damages above that amount, up to a cap GAO estimated to be $3.1 billion in 2017, subject to appropriations in advance. CSLCA, enacted in 2015, directed the Department of Transportation, of which FAA is a part, to evaluate its MPL methodology and, if necessary, develop a plan to update that methodology. The act also included a provision requiring GAO to assess FAA's evaluation and any actions needed to update the methodology. This report discusses the extent to which (1) FAA's evaluation report addresses the requirements in CSLCA and (2) FAA has addressed previously identified weaknesses in the MPL methodology. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed FAA on its loss methodology evaluation and actions to address weaknesses. The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) report evaluating its maximum probable loss (MPL) methodology did not fully address the evaluation and consultation requirements specified by the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act (CSLCA). Balance of Risk. CSLCA required FAA to include ensuring that the federal government is not exposed to greater indemnification costs and that launch companies are not required to purchase more insurance coverage than necessary as a result of FAA's MPL methodology. FAA said that it ensured this balance by improving its methodology, but it did not reevaluate its probability thresholds after revising its methodology. These thresholds are used to divide the risk of loss between launch companies and the government. Impact on Costs. The act required FAA to consider the costs to both the industry and the federal government of implementing an updated methodology. FAA's report discussed the impact on indirect costs, such as data collection, but did not discuss direct costs: insurance premiums for launch companies and indemnification liability for the federal government. Consultation. The act also required FAA to consult with the commercial space sector and insurance providers in evaluating its MPL methodology in accordance with the preceding requirements. While the agency consulted with some stakeholders, these consultations were limited in scope. FAA officials said they have not been able to take the actions needed to fully satisfy the mandated elements because of issues such as resource limitations and the lack of available data. However, by not resolving these issues, FAA lacks assurance that launch companies are not purchasing more insurance than needed or that the federal government is not being exposed to greater indemnification costs than expected. FAA has addressed two of three previously identified weaknesses in its MPL methodology but has not yet dealt with the remaining weakness. Specifically, the agency has revised its methodology for estimating the number of potential casualties for a launch and changed the factor it uses to derive estimated property damage from estimated casualties. However, FAA has not updated the amount used for the cost of an individual casualty. GAO recommended in a March 2017 report (GAO-17-366) that FAA update this amount. Not doing so could understate the amount of insurance launch companies are required to purchase, exposing the federal government to excess risk. GAO also determined that while FAA has two tools and methods it can use in making its MPL estimates, it does not have guidance on determining which are most appropriate for a given launch scenario. For example, one tool is more comprehensive but also labor intensive to use, while the other is inappropriate for certain launch scenarios and could result in misleading MPL amounts. Officials said they have begun to create such guidance but do not have an estimated completion date. Without such guidance, FAA cannot ensure that the most appropriate MPL methodology is used for each launch. FAA should fully address mandated requirements in evaluating its MPL—probability thresholds, direct costs, and stakeholder consultations— and establish an estimated completion date for developing guidance on tools and methods to use for specific launch scenarios. The Department of Transportation concurred with the recommendations, and provided technical comments."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4125}
{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this Coast Guard report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. \n\nThe report starts by giving an overview of the Coast Guard's structure and operations. They have over 47,000 staff, a large fleet of aircraft and vessels, divided into geographic areas and districts. The headquarters handles oversight, policy, and personnel. Then it mentions the 11 statutory missions under the Homeland Security Act, managed through six mission programs. \n\nOne of the missions is marine safety, which includes inspections and accident investigations, especially for commercial fishing vessels. The report points out that commercial fishing has a high death rate, but the Coast Guard's data is incomplete. For example, they can't calculate accident rates by fishery type because they don't have that data. They also can't determine the number of accidents, injuries, and fatalities by fishery. The Coast Guard has been working on improving data collection, like adding fields for fishery type, and engaging stakeholders. \n\nThen there's a part about using more realistic asset performance data. The Coast Guard's asset performance data was based on unrealistic assumptions, leading to misallocation of assets. The report recommends incorporating field unit data on actual asset performance to set more realistic asset allocation goals. The Coast Guard is working on updating process documents. \n\nAnother section talks about improving performance goal data. The report found that some performance goals, like the number of recreational boating deaths and injuries, have underreporting issues. Also, the goal of detecting foreign fishing vessel incursions is problematic because it's hard to measure deterrence. The Coast Guard is working with DHS and OMB to improve these goals. \n\nThen there's a part about improving transparency of data on mission performance. The Coast Guard hasn't released their APR publicly since 2011, which limits oversight. They plan to make the 2017 APR public. \n\nLastly, there's a section on improving capital planning transparency. The Coast Guard's capital investment plan doesn't consistently reflect current cost estimates or tradeoffs. The Coast Guard is developing a 20-year plan but hasn't set a timeline. \n\nI need to condense all this into a one-page summary. Let me structure it with an introduction, key points, and a conclusion. \n\nStart with the Coast Guard's structure and missions. Mention the 47,000", "answers": ["The Coast Guard, a component of DHS, serves as the principal federal agency responsible for maritime safety, security, and environmental stewardship in U.S. ports and waterways. To ensure that the Coast Guard is effectively fulfilling its missions, agency managers must have accurate information and base decisions on sound analyses for effective program management. This statement discusses Coast Guard actions needed to (1) improve the quality of data used for program management and (2) improve the transparency of its data for reporting on mission performance and planning. This statement is based on relevant products GAO issued from June 2014 through December 2017 on Coast Guard strategic planning and management issues, as well as related recommendation follow-up conducted through February 2018. GAO reviewed applicable laws, regulations, policies and guidance. GAO also interviewed Coast Guard officials responsible for administering these programs and obtained information on how they used data to inform decisionmaking. GAO interviewed a range of stakeholders, including federal and industry officials. GAO's prior work recommended multiple actions to improve the Coast Guard's program management by improving the quality of data it uses to manage and report on its mission performance. Specifically, GAO recommended actions such as collecting more complete data and clarifying the data limitations to facilitate more effective program management. For example, in December 2017, GAO found that more information is needed to calculate vessel safety statistics that could enhance the Coast Guard's knowledge about accident, injury, and fatality trends involving commercial fishing vessels. Having more complete information could be useful to carrying out its marine safety mission, and GAO recommended, among other things, that the Coast Guard ensure that data collected during commercial fishing vessel incident investigations is accurately captured. In 2018, the Coast Guard reported taking initial steps to capture more accurate data. GAO's prior work also identified areas where the Coast Guard could improve the transparency of the data it uses for reporting on its mission performance as well its capital planning purposes. For example, in an October 2017 report on performance goals, GAO found the Coast Guard's Annual Performance Report (APR) has not been released publicly since 2011. Consequently, there has not been full visibility over performance across all of the Coast Guard's missions. Coast Guard officials stated that a decision by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership to limit the number of performance goals shared publicly had deterred the Coast Guard from public release of its APR. GAO recommended that APRs be available on the Coast Guard's website; the Coast Guard plans to publicly release future APRs. In addition, previous GAO reports found that the Coast Guard's annual 5-year capital investment plan, which projects acquisition funding needs for the upcoming 5 years, did not consistently reflect current total cost estimates or the effects of tradeoffs made as part of the annual budget cycle. GAO made recommendations to help the Coast Guard plan for future acquisitions and the difficult trade off decisions it will face given funding constraints. The Coast Guard agreed, but it is unclear when it will complete the 20-year plan. GAO is not making new recommendations in this statement but has made them to the Coast Guard and DHS in the past on improving its program management through, among other things, better quality and more transparent data. DHS and the Coast Guard agreed with these recommendations and reported actions or plans to address them."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2542}
{"pred": " The report discusses the origins and current state of the Small Business Act (SBA) in the United States, highlighting its role in supporting small businesses through various federal programs and initiatives. The SBA was established in 1953 as a response to the threats posed to small businesses during World War II and the Korean War, when shortages of materials and difficulties in obtaining defense contracts or financial assistance were prevalent. The primary objective of the SBA is to ensure that small businesses receive a \"fair proportion\" of federal contracts and subcontracts, thereby preserving free competitive enterprise. The report outlines the various federal requirements and authorities that promote contracting and subcontracting with small businesses, including the requirement that federal agencies reserve contracts with an anticipated value greater than the micro-purchase threshold (currently $10,000) but not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $250,000) exclusively for small businesses unless the contracting officer is unable to obtain offers from two or more small businesses that are competitive with market prices and the quality and delivery of the goods or services being purchased. It also discusses the establishment of specific types of small businesses, such as 8(a) participants, HUBZone small businesses, women-owned small businesses, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and the various programs that support these businesses. The report highlights the economic benefits of these programs, including increased market competition, greater product variety, and lower prices. It also discusses the role of the Office of Small Business Utilization (OSBPU) in promoting fair competition among small businesses. The SBA administers several programs to assist small businesses in obtaining and performing federal contracts, including loan guaranty and venture capital programs to enhance small business access to capital; contracting programs to increase small business opportunities in federal contracting; direct loan programs for businesses, homeowners, and renters to assist their recovery from natural disasters; and small business management and technical assistance training programs to assist business formation and expansion. The report also examines the challenges and criticisms faced by these programs, including the exclusion of certain contracts from small business contracting preferences, and the effectiveness of these programs in promoting small business opportunities and a more diversified economy. The SBA also provides oversight and responsibilities concerning the small business goaling program, small business mentor-protégé programs, the 7(j) management and technical assistance program, and the surety bond guaranty program. It discusses the role of the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) in promoting contracting with small businesses,", "answers": ["Congress has broad authority to impose requirements upon the federal procurement process, that is, the process whereby agencies obtain goods and services from the private sector. One way in which Congress has exercised this authority is by adopting measures to promote contracting and subcontracting between \"small businesses\" and federal agencies. These measures, among other things, declare a congressional policy of ensuring that a \"fair proportion\" of federal contract and subcontract dollars is awarded to small businesses; establish government-wide and agency-specific goals for the percentage of federal contract and subcontract dollars awarded to small businesses; establish an annual Small Business Goaling Report to measure progress in meeting these goals; generally require federal agencies, under specified circumstances, to reserve contracts that have an anticipated value greater than the micro-purchase threshold (currently $10,000), but not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $250,000) exclusively for small businesses; authorize federal agencies, under specified circumstances, to set aside contracts that have an anticipated value greater than the simplified acquisition threshold exclusively for small businesses; authorize federal agencies to make sole source awards to small businesses when the award could not otherwise be made (e.g., only a single source is available, under urgent and compelling circumstances); authorize federal agencies to set aside contracts for, or grant other contracting preference to, specific types of small businesses (e.g., 8(a) small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, women-owned small businesses (WOSBs) and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs)); and task the Small Business Administration (SBA) and other federal procurement officers with reviewing and restructuring proposed procurements to maximize opportunities for small business participation. Small business contracting programs generally have strong bipartisan support. However, that does not mean that these programs face no opposition, or that issues have not been raised concerning the impact and operations of specific programs. For example, small business advocates note that implementing regulations in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) narrow the reach (and impact) of some small business contracting preferences by excluding specific types of contracts, such as those listed in the Federal Supply Schedules, from FAR requirements pertaining to small business contracting. Advocates want the federal government to enact policies that reduce or eliminate such exclusions. Critics have questioned some of these programs' effectiveness, in terms of both promoting small business opportunities to win federal contracts and promoting a more diversified, robust economy. Many observers judge the relative success or failure of federal efforts to enhance small business contracting opportunities by whether federal government and individual federal agencies meet the predetermined procurement goals in the annual Small Business Goaling Report. In recent years, the federal government has generally succeeded in meeting the government-wide goals of awarding 23% of the total value of all small business eligible prime contract awards to small businesses, 5% to small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs), and 3% to SDVOSBs. It has had difficulty meeting the goals of 5% to WOSBs and 3% to HUBZone small businesses. The Small Business Goaling Report is the most convenient measure available to compare federal small business contracting performance over time, but it has limitations. For example, the SBA excludes some contracts from the report in its determination of what is \"small business eligible\" and some federal procurement activities are not included because they are not recorded in the Federal Procurement Data System—Next Generation. It also does not evaluate the effect these contracts have on small businesses, industry competitiveness, or the overall economy."], "all_classes": null, "length": 9547}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe LWCF Act was established in 1965 with the goal of preserving and making outdoor recreation accessible. The main objectives were to promote participation in recreation and enhance public health. The fund gets $900 million annually, mostly from oil and gas leases on the Outer Continental Shelf, motorboat fuel taxes, and surplus sales. But these funds are only available if Congress appropriates them through the discretionary process. There's also GOMESA, which gives additional money that's mandatory and can't be cut. The total revenues are $40.9 billion, but only $18.9 billion has been appropriated. The unappropriated balance is $22 billion. The law requires that at least 40% be used for federal purposes and 40% for state grants. The funds are used for land acquisition by federal agencies and state grants for outdoor recreation. \n\nThe report mentions that the fund's revenues are from various sources, but the actual use of the funds depends on annual appropriations. The LWCF has been used for three main purposes: federal land acquisition, state grants, and other purposes. The largest portion of the appropriated funds went to federal land acquisition, then state grants, then other purposes. \n\nThere's a part about the unappropriated balance and how the funds are allocated. Also, there's a discussion about the use of LWCF funds for other purposes, like deferred maintenance, infrastructure, etc. The report also talks about the different programs that have been funded through LWCF, such as Forest Legacy, Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, and State and Tribal Wildlife Grants. \n\nThe report notes that while the LWCF has a large balance, the amount appropriated has varied. Some years, more was allocated for other purposes, but in recent years, it's been less. There's also a mention of debates in Congress about whether to expand the use of LWCF funds for other purposes, which some argue could reduce funds for land acquisition and state grants. \n\nI need to condense all this into a one-page summary. Let me structure it with an introduction, key points about the fund's purpose, funding sources, appropriation process, allocation of funds, and the debate over expanding uses. \n\nWait, the report also has appendices, but the summary should focus on", "answers": ["The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Act of 1965 (P.L. 88-578) created the LWCF in the Treasury as a funding source to implement the outdoor recreation goals set out by the act. The LWCF Act authorizes the fund to receive $900 million annually, with the monies available only if appropriated by Congress (i.e., discretionary appropriations). The fund also receives mandatory appropriations under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA). The level of annual appropriations for the LWCF has varied since the origin of the fund in FY1965. The LWCF Act outlines uses of the fund for federal and state purposes. Of the total made available through appropriations or deposits under GOMESA, not less than 40% is to be used for \"federal purposes\" and not less than 40% is to be used to provide \"financial assistance to states.\" The act lists the federal purposes for which the President is to allot LWCF funds \"unless otherwise allotted in the appropriation Act making them available.\" These purposes primarily relate to acquisition of lands and waters (and interests therein) by the federal government. With regard to state purposes, the act authorizes a matching grant program to states for outdoor recreation purposes. Throughout the LWCF's history, appropriations acts typically have provided funds for land acquisition and outdoor recreational grants to states. Beginning in FY1998, appropriations also have been provided each year (except FY1999) to fund other purposes related to natural resources. The extent to which the LWCF should be used for purposes other than federal land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants to states, and which other purposes should be funded from the LWCF, continue to be the subject of legislation and debate in Congress. In the past few decades, Presidents have sought LWCF funds for a variety of other purposes. Congress chooses which if any of these requests to fund, and has chosen programs not sought by the President for a particular year. Among other programs, appropriations have been provided for facility maintenance of the land management agencies, ecosystem restoration, the Historic Preservation Fund, the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, the Forest Legacy Program, State and Tribal Wildlife Grants (under the Fish and Wildlife Service), the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, U.S. Geological Survey science and cooperative programs, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Indian Land and Water Claim Settlements. Since FY1998, a total of $2.7 billion has been appropriated for other purposes, of a total LWCF appropriation of $18.9 billion over the history of the fund. The Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service have received the largest shares of the total appropriations for other purposes, about $1.4 billion (53%) and $1.0.billion (38%), respectively, from FY1998 to FY2019. Several agencies shared the remaining $0.2 billion (9%) of the appropriations. Both the dollar amounts and the percentages of annual LWCF appropriations for other purposes have varied widely since FY1998. The dollar amounts have ranged from $0 in FY1999 to $456.0 million in FY2001. The percentage of annual funds provided for other purposes ranged from 0% in FY1999 to a high of 59% in both FY2006 and FY2007. In some years, the appropriation for other purposes was significantly less than the Administration requested. For instance, for FY2008, the George W. Bush Administration sought $313.1 million; the appropriation was $101.3 million. The appropriation for other purposes last exceeded $100.0 million in FY2010, and most recently was $93.3 million, in FY2019. Prior to FY2008, several other purposes typically were funded each year from LWCF. Since FY2008, funds have been appropriated annually only for grants under two programs: Forest Legacy and Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund.

{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report about the Navy's issues. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report mentions that since 2017, the Navy has had four major mishaps, leading to 17 sailor deaths and significant ship damage. Three of these incidents involved ships based in Yokosuka, Japan. The Navy has reduced its fleet size by 17% since 1998, but the number of ships deployed overseas has stayed around 100, so each ship is overworked. There's a problem with readiness levels, which the Navy attributes to longer deployments. For example, carrier strike groups' deployment time increased from 6.4 months to 9 months. The Navy has had to cut training and maintenance, leading to worse ship conditions and longer maintenance times. This creates a cycle where ships are less available for training and operations. The Navy has increased the number of ships based overseas, doubling the percentage since 2006. However, this leads to higher operational costs and lower readiness. The report also talks about the operational tempo of overseas-based ships, which limits dedicated training periods, leading to crews not being fully trained. The Navy has been reducing the number of certifications. The report recommends developing sustainable operational schedules for overseas-based ships. However, as of August 2017, the revised operational schedules for cruisers and destroyers in Japan were still under review and not yet implemented. As a result, 37% of the warfare certifications for these ships had expired, with over two-thirds of those expired for 5 months or more. This is a significant increase from the May 2015 report. The Navy has also been reducing crew sizes to save costs, but this has led to worse ship conditions and higher costs. The Navy has been having trouble filling crew positions, and the report recommends reassessing the risks of overseas basing, adjusting the manning based on assessments, and updating the ship manning requirements. The Navy has been facing challenges with maintenance and training. The report also discusses the Navy's readiness issues, including the high operational tempo, which reduces training time. The Navy has been trying to implement the optimized fleet response plan, but there are still issues with maintenance and training. The Navy has been having problems with shipyards and maintenance. The report highlights the Navy", "answers": ["Since January 2017, the Navy has suffered four significant mishaps at sea that resulted in serious damage to its ships and the loss of 17 sailors. Three of these incidents involved ships homeported in Japan. In response to these incidents, the Chief of Naval Operations ordered an operational pause for all fleets worldwide, and the Vice Chief of Naval Operations directed a comprehensive review of surface fleet operations, stating that these tragic incidents are not limited occurrences but part of a disturbing trend in mishaps involving U.S. ships. This statement provides information on the effects of homeporting ships overseas, reducing crew size on ships, and not completing maintenance on time on the readiness of the Navy and summarizes GAO recommendations to address the Navy's maintenance, training, and other challenges. In preparing this statement, GAO relied on work it has published since 2015 related to the readiness of ships homeported overseas, sailor training and workload issues, maintenance challenges, and other issues. GAO updated this information, as appropriate, based on Navy data. GAO's prior work shows that the Navy has increased deployment lengths, shortened training periods, and reduced or deferred maintenance to meet high operational demands, which has resulted in declining ship conditions and a worsening trend in overall readiness. The Navy has stated that high demand for presence has put pressure on a fleet that is stretched thin across the globe. Some of the concerns that GAO has highlighted include: Degraded readiness of ships homeported overseas: Since 2006, the Navy has doubled the number of ships based overseas. Overseas basing provides additional forward presence and rapid crisis response, but GAO found in May 2015 that there were no dedicated training periods built into the operational schedules of the cruisers and destroyers based in Japan. As a result, the crews of these ships did not have all of their needed training and certifications. Based on updated data, GAO found that, as of June 2017, 37 percent of the warfare certifications for cruiser and destroyer crews based in Japan—including certifications for seamanship—had expired. This represents more than a fivefold increase in the percentage of expired warfare certifications for these ships since GAO's May 2015 report. The Navy has made plans to revise operational schedules to provide dedicated training time for overseas-based ships, but this schedule has not yet been implemented. Crew size reductions contribute to sailor overwork and safety risks: GAO found in May 2017 that reductions to crew sizes the Navy made in the early 2000s were not analytically supported and may now be creating safety risks. The Navy has reversed some of those changes but continues to use a workweek standard that does not reflect the actual time sailors spend working and does not account for in-port workload—both of which have contributed to some sailors working over 100 hours a week. Inability to complete maintenance on time: Navy recovery from persistently low readiness levels is premised on adherence to maintenance schedules. However, in May 2016, GAO found that the Navy was having difficulty completing maintenance on time. Based on updated data, GAO found that, in fiscal years 2011 through 2016, maintenance overruns on 107 of 169 surface ships (63 percent) resulted in 6,603 lost operational days (i.e., the ships were not available for training and operations). Looking to the future, the Navy wants to grow its fleet by as much as 30 percent but continues to face challenges with manning, training, and maintaining its existing fleet. These readiness problems need to be addressed and will require the Navy to implement GAO's recommendations—particularly in the areas of assessing the risks associated with overseas basing, reassessing sailor workload and the factors used to size ship crews, managing investments to modernize and improve the efficiency of the naval shipyards, and applying sound planning and sustained management attention to its readiness rebuilding efforts. In addition, continued congressional oversight will be needed to ensure that the Navy demonstrates progress in addressing its maintenance, training, and other challenges. GAO made 14 recommendations in prior work cited in this statement. The Department of Defense generally concurred with all of them but has implemented only 1. Continued attention is needed to ensure that these recommendations are addressed, such as the Navy assessing the risks associated with overseas basing and reassessing sailor workload and factors used in its manpower requirements process."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3534}
{"pred": " The report explores the complexities of the digital economy and its implications for international tax policy, particularly focusing on the emergence of digital services taxes (DSTs) in Europe. The digital economy encompasses a wide range of economic activities that are connected through computers, mobile phones, or other internet-connected devices. These activities often operate in \"two-sided markets\" where they provide services to individual users (often at zero charge) and sell other services to businesses (e.g., advertising to users).. DSTs are being proposed by various European countries to address perceived tax avoidance by multinational corporations (MNCs) in the digital economy. The rationale for DSTs includes the argument that MNCs in the digital economy are not paying their \"fair share\" of taxes, as they can generate revenue from users in a country without establishing a physical presence there. This is attributed to the ability of digital economy businesses to provide services without a physical location, and to shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions through transfer pricing. The U.S. has expressed opposition to these unilateral taxes, citing concerns about the potential for targeting American firms and the need for international consensus. The report highlights that the current international tax system is not well-suited to the unique characteristics of the digital economy, such as the ability to generate value from user interactions and data. It discusses the two main issues: (1) the absence of a physical presence in the country where the users reside, and (2) the ability to shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions. The report also examines the various DST proposals from European countries, including the UK and France, and the European Commission's efforts to create a unified approach. The report concludes that DSTs are not structured as taxes on profits, but rather as excise taxes on revenue, and thus may have different economic effects, including potential regressive impacts on tax revenue collection. The report also discusses the economic efficiency, vertical equity, and administrative challenges associated with DSTs. It emphasizes the need for international cooperation to reform the global tax system in a way that is equitable and efficient, rather than relying on unilateral measures that could create trade distortions and inequities in the global economy.\n\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report.

These proposals have generally been labeled as \"digital services taxes\" (DSTs). For example, beginning in 2019, Spain is imposing a DST of 3% on online advertising, online marketplaces, and data transfer service (i.e., revenue from sales of user activities) within Spain. Only firms with €750 million in worldwide revenue and €3 million in revenues with users in Spain are to be subject to the tax. In 2020, the UK plans to implement a 3% DST that would apply only to businesses whose revenues exceed £25 million per year and groups that generate global revenues from search engines, social media platforms, and online marketplaces in excess of £500 million annually. The UK labels its DST as an \"interim\" solution until international tax rules are modified to allow countries to tax the profits of foreign MNCs if they have a substantial enough \"digital presence\" based on local users. The member states of the European Commission are also actively considering such a rule. These policies are being considered and enacted against a backdrop of ongoing, multilateral negotiations among members and nonmembers of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). These negotiations, prompted by discussions of the digital economy, could result in significant changes for the international tax system. Proponents of DSTs argue that digital firms are \"undertaxed.\" This sentiment is driven in part by some high-profile tech companies that reduced the taxes they paid by assigning ownership of their income-producing intangible assets (e.g., patents, marketing, and trade secrets) to affiliate corporations in low-tax jurisdictions. Proponents of DSTs also argue that the countries imposing tax should be entitled to a share of profits earned by digital MNCs because of the \"value\" to these business models made by participation of their residents through their content, reviews, purchases, and other contributions. Critics of DSTs argue that the taxes target income or profits that would not otherwise be subject to taxation under generally accepted income tax principles. U.S. critics, in particular, see DSTs as an attempt to target U.S. tech companies, especially as minimum thresholds are high enough that only the largest digital MNCs (such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon) will be subject to these specific taxes. DSTs are structured as a selective tax on revenue (akin to an excise tax) and not as a tax on corporate profits. A tax on corporate profits taxes the return to investment in the corporate sector. Corporate profit is equal to total revenue minus total cost. In contrast, DSTs are \"turnover taxes\" that apply to the revenue generated from taxable activities regardless of costs incurred by a firm. Additionally, international tax rules do not allow countries to tax an MNC's cross-border income solely because their residents purchase goods or services provided by that firm. Rather, ownership of assets justifies a country to be allocated a share of that MNC's profits to tax. Under these rules and their underlying principles, the fact that a country's residents purchase digital services from an MNC is not a justification to tax the MNC's profits. DSTs are likely to have the economic effect of an excise tax on intermediate services. The economic incidence of a DST is likely to be borne by purchasers of taxable services (e.g., companies paying digital economy firms for advertising, marketplace listings, or user data) and possibly consumers downstream from those transactions. As a result, economic theory and the general body of empirical research on excise taxes predict that DSTs are likely to increase prices in affected markets, decrease quantity supplied, and reduce investment in these sectors. Compared to a corporate profits tax—which, on balance, tends to be borne by higher-income shareholders—DSTs are expected to be more regressive forms of raising revenue, as they affect a broad range of consumer goods and services. Certain design features of DSTs could also create inequitable treatment between firms and increase administrative complexity. For example, minimum revenue thresholds could be set such that primarily large, foreign (and primarily U.S.) corporations are subject to tax. Requirements to identify the location of users could also introduce significant costs on businesses. This report traces the emergence of DSTs from multilateral tax negotiations in recent years, addresses various purported policy justifications of DSTs, provides an economic analysis of their effects, and raises several issues for Congress."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12505}
{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this long report about First Amendment jurisprudence and commercial disclosure requirements. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report discusses how the First Amendment applies to commercial speech, particularly when the government requires businesses to disclose certain information to consumers. It mentions that while the First Amendment protects the right to speak and the right not to speak, compelled speech is generally subject to strict scrutiny. However, commercial speech is treated differently because it's considered less protected than noncommercial speech. The Supreme Court has upheld some disclosure requirements, especially those that target conduct rather than speech itself. \n\nThere are different levels of scrutiny: strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny (Central Hudson), and the Zauderer standard. The Zauderer case is about requiring certain factual information in advertising, which is more lenient. The report explains that disclosure requirements are subject to different standards depending on the nature of the disclosure. For example, if the disclosure is factual and uncontroversial, then Zauderer applies. However, in recent cases like NIFLA, the Court has suggested that certain disclosure requirements might be subject to heightened scrutiny. \n\nThe report also talks about the shifting role of content neutrality in commercial speech doctrine. In Sorrell, the Court applied Central Hudson scrutiny. The report mentions that disclosure requirements are content-based, but the Court did not definitively say that they should be subject to strict scrutiny. \n\nThe key takeaway is that while the government can compel certain disclosures, especially those related to misleading information, the standards of review are evolving. The Supreme Court has applied different levels of scrutiny based on the specific circumstances of the disclosure requirement. \n\nI need to condense all this into a one-page summary. Let me outline the main points:\n\n1. Introduction to compelled speech and First Amendment protections.\n2. The Supreme Court's stance on compelled speech vs. commercial speech.\n3. The Central Hudson test for intermediate scrutiny.\n4. The Zauderer standard, which is the most lenient.\n5. The shifting standards and the impact of recent cases like NIFLA and Milavetz.\n6. The importance of evidence in supporting the government's interest.\n7. The implications for future legislation and disclosure requirements.\n\nNow, I need to structure this into a coherent summary. Start with the main topic: the legal framework for commercial disclosure requirements under the First Amendment. Mention the tension between compelled", "answers": ["Federal law contains a wide variety of disclosure requirements, including food labels, securities registrations, and disclosures about prescription drugs in direct-to-consumer advertising. These disclosure provisions require commercial actors to make statements that they otherwise might not, compelling speech and implicating the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. Nonetheless, while commercial disclosure requirements may regulate protected speech, that fact in and of itself does not render such provisions unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has historically allowed greater regulation of commercial speech than of other types of speech. Since at least the mid-1970s, however, the Supreme Court has been increasingly protective of commercial speech. This trend, along with other developments in First Amendment law, has led some commentators to question whether the Supreme Court might apply a stricter test in assessing commercial disclosure requirements in the near future. Nonetheless, governing Supreme Court precedent provides that disclosure requirements generally receive lesser judicial scrutiny when they compel only commercial speech, as opposed to noncommercial speech. In National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra, a decision released in June 2018, the Supreme Court explained that it has applied a lower level of scrutiny to compelled disclosures under two circumstances. First, the Supreme Court has sometimes upheld laws that regulate commercial speech if the speech regulation is part of a larger regulatory scheme that is focused on conduct and only incidentally burdens speech. If a law is properly characterized as a regulation of conduct, rather than speech, then it may be subject to rational basis review, a deferential standard that asks only whether the regulation is a rational way to address the problem. However, it can be difficult to distinguish speech from conduct, and the Supreme Court has not frequently invoked this doctrine to uphold laws against First Amendment challenges. Second, the Supreme Court has sometimes applied a lower level of scrutiny to certain commercial disclosure requirements under the authority of a 1985 case, Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel. In Zauderer, the Court upheld a disclosure requirement after noting that the challenged provision compelled only \"factual and uncontroversial information about the terms under which . . . services will be available.\" The Court said that under the circumstances, the service provider's First Amendment rights were sufficiently protected because the disclosure requirement was \"reasonably related\" to the government's interest \"in preventing deception of consumers.\" Lower courts have generally interpreted Zauderer to mean that if a commercial disclosure provision requires only \"factual and uncontroversial information\" about the goods or services being offered, it should be analyzed under rational basis review. If a commercial disclosure requirement does not qualify for review under Zauderer, then it will most likely be analyzed under the intermediate standard that generally applies to government actions that regulate commercial speech. Some legal scholars have argued that recent Supreme Court case law suggests the Court may subject commercial disclosure provisions to stricter scrutiny in the future, either by limiting the factual circumstances under which these two doctrines apply or by creating express exceptions to these doctrines. If a court applies a heightened level of scrutiny, it may require the government to present more evidence of the problem it is seeking to remedy and stronger justifications for choosing a disclosure requirement to achieve its purposes."], "all_classes": null, "length": 9534}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy government report about the U.S. involvement in Afghanistan's security. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points.\n\nThe report talks about the U.S. commitment to building Afghanistan's security and governance since 2001 to prevent it from becoming a terrorist haven. There are two missions: a U.S.-led counterterrorism mission and the NATO-led Resolute Support mission. The goal of Resolute Support is to create self-sustaining Afghan security ministries and forces. However, the security situation has deteriorated since the 2015 transition to Afghan-led security. The UN reported 24,000 incidents in 2017, the most ever. Even though there was a slight decrease in 2018, the UN noted significant challenges, including a spike in high-casualty attacks in urban areas and coordinated attacks by the insurgency on ANDSF checkpoints. \n\nThe U.S. contributes significantly to Resolute Support, with 54% of the personnel as of May 2018. The funding for the Afghan Security Forces Fund is around $4.67 billion for fiscal year 2018. The U.S. has provided a lot of equipment, like 600,000 weapons, 163,000 radios, 76,000 vehicles, etc. The Afghan government has its own security forces, which are divided into conventional and specialized forces. The specialized forces are more capable, while the conventional forces still need coalition support. \n\nThe U.S. has spent nearly $84 billion on Afghan security from 2002 to 2018. However, the Afghan security forces still have capability gaps, making them reliant on U.S. and coalition forces. The U.S. has invested heavily in training, advising, and equipping the Afghan security forces, but the challenge remains to develop a self-sustaining Afghan security forces. \n\nThe U.S. has two main missions: counterterrorism and Resolute Support. The latter is a NATO mission with the U.S. participating. The objective is to create self-sustaining Afghan security ministries and forces.

The United States is the largest contributor of funding and personnel to Resolute Support, providing and maintaining ANDSF equipment, along with training, advising, and assistance to help the ANDSF effectively use and sustain the equipment in the future. House Report 114-537 included a provision for GAO to review the ANDSF's capability and capacity to operate and sustain U.S.-purchased weapon systems and equipment. This report addresses (1) what has been reported about ANDSF capabilities and capability gaps and (2) the extent to which DOD has information about the ANDSF's ability to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment. To conduct this work, GAO analyzed DOD and NATO reports and documents, examined three critical equipment types, and interviewed DOD officials in the United States and Afghanistan. This is a public version of a sensitive report issued in September 2018. Information that DOD deemed sensitive has been omitted. Since the Resolute Support mission began in 2015, the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) have improved some fundamental capabilities, such as high-level operational planning, but continue to rely on U.S. and coalition support to fill several key capability gaps, according to Department of Defense (DOD) reporting. DOD has initiatives to address some ANDSF capability gaps, such as a country-wide vehicle maintenance and training effort, but DOD reports it does not expect the ANDSF to develop and sustain independent capabilities in some areas, such as logistics, for several years. While DOD has firsthand information on the abilities of the Afghan Air Force and Special Security Forces to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment, it has little reliable information on the equipment proficiency of conventional ANDSF units. U.S. and coalition advisors are embedded at the tactical level for the Air Force and Special Security Forces, enabling DOD to directly assess those forces' abilities. However, the advisors have little direct contact with conventional ANDSF units on the front lines. As a result, DOD relies on those units' self-assessments of tactical abilities, which, according to DOD officials, can be unreliable. GAO's analysis of three critical equipment types illustrated the varying degrees of DOD's information (see figure above). For example, DOD provided detailed information about the Air Force's ability to operate and maintain MD-530 helicopters and the Special Security Forces' ability to operate and maintain Mobile Strike Force Vehicles; however, DOD had limited information about how conventional forces operate and maintain radios and Mobile Strike Force Vehicles. DOD's lack of reliable information on conventional forces' equipment operations and maintenance abilities adds to the uncertainty and risk in assessing the progress of DOD efforts in Afghanistan. GAO recommends that DOD develop options for collecting reliable information on conventional ANDSF units' ability to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment.

{"pred": " The report discusses the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), which provides federal funding to states to improve child protective service systems. Administered by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), CAPTA requires states to submit plans outlining how they will use the funds, and to provide annual data reports on child abuse and neglect cases. Since 2003, governors have had to assure that states have policies to address infants affected by prenatal substance abuse. The 2016 Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) amended CAPTA to include infants affected by both legal and illegal substances. The report highlights the challenges states face in implementing these new requirements, including the lack of clear guidance on defining \"substance-affected\" and the definition of \"plan of safe care.\" Many states have policies requiring healthcare providers to notify CPS about substance-affected infants. However, some states have not implemented these policies, and others are working to amend their policies to require healthcare providers to report substance-affected infants. The opioid epidemic has led to a significant increase in the number of infants born with NAS. The report outlines the process by which states handle reports of child abuse and neglect, including the investigation process, risk assessments, and development of case plans. It also discusses the challenges states face in developing and implementing plans of safe care for these infants and their families, including confidentiality issues and resource limitations. The report also mentions the National Center for Substance Abuse and Child Welfare (NCSACW) providing technical assistance to states on implementing CAPTA provisions, including collaboration among service providers and developing plans of safe care. The report concludes that additional guidance from HHS is needed to help states better understand and meet the requirements of CAPTA, particularly regarding the notification of CPS by healthcare providers and the development of safe care plans for these infants and their families.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report about CAPTA. Let me start by reading through the report again to get the main points. \n\nThe report is about the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), which was first enacted in 1974. It provides formula grants to states to improve their child protective service systems. The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) administers this program and provides guidance and oversight. In 2017, Congress allocated about $25 million for the program. States must submit plans to HHS on how they'll use the funds, and these plans are valid for the duration of the grant. They can", "answers": ["Under CAPTA, states perform a range of prevention activities, including addressing the needs of infants born with prenatal drug exposure. The number of children under the age of 1 entering foster care increased by about 15 percent from fiscal years 2012 through 2015. Child welfare professionals attribute the increase to the opioid epidemic. GAO was asked to examine the steps states are taking to implement CAPTA requirements on substance-affected infants and related amendments enacted in 2016. This report examines (1) the extent to which states have adopted policies and procedures to notify CPS of substance-affected infants; (2) state efforts to develop plans of safe care, and associated challenges; and (3) steps HHS has taken to help states implement the provisions. To obtain this information, GAO surveyed state CPS directors in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and reached a 100 percent response rate. GAO also visited 3 states (Kentucky, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania); reviewed relevant documents such as federal laws and regulations, and HHS guidance; and interviewed HHS officials. GAO did not assess states' compliance with CAPTA requirements. All states reported adopting, to varying degrees, policies and procedures regarding health care providers notifying child protective services (CPS) about infants affected by opioids or other substances. Under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), as amended, governors are required to provide assurances that the states have laws or programs that include policies and procedures to address the needs of infants affected by prenatal substance use. This is to include health care providers notifying CPS of substance-affected infants. In response to GAO's survey, 42 states reported having policies and procedures that require health care providers to notify CPS about substance-affected infants and 8 states reported having policies that encourage notification. The remaining 1 state has a policy requiring health care providers to assess the needs of mothers and infants and if they conclude that infants are at risk for abuse or neglect, CPS is notified. In response to GAO's survey, 49 states reported that their CPS agency has policies to develop a plan of safe care; 2 reported not having such a requirement. Under CAPTA, states are required to develop a plan of safe care for substance-affected infants. Although not defined in law, a plan of safe care generally entails an assessment of the family's situation and a plan for connecting families to appropriate services to stabilize the family and ensure the child's safety and well-being. States reported that plans typically address the infant's safety needs, immediate medical needs, and the caregiver's substance use treatment needs. However, officials in the 3 states GAO visited noted challenges, including uncertainty about what to include in plans and the level of intervention needed for infants at low risk of abuse or neglect. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has provided technical assistance and guidance to states to implement these CAPTA requirements. Most states reported in GAO's survey that additional guidance and assistance would be very or extremely helpful for addressing their challenges. Nevertheless, HHS officials told GAO that the agency does not anticipate issuing additional written guidance, but that states can access technical assistance through their regional offices and the National Center on Substance Abuse and Child Welfare—a resource center funded by HHS. However, of the 37 states that reported on the helpfulness of the assistance they have received, 19 said it was only moderately helpful to not helpful. States offered suggestions for improving the assistance, such as developing substance abuse training materials for staff and holding video conferences with other states to share information. In October 2017, HHS officials explained that some states have submitted plans that include details on how they are addressing the CAPTA requirements. HHS officials reported that some of the plans submitted to date indicated that states are not meeting the requirements and those states have been asked to develop program improvement plans. Without more specific guidance and assistance to enhance states' understanding of CAPTA requirements and better address known challenges such as the ones described in this report, states may miss an opportunity to provide more effective protections and services for the children and families most in need. GAO recommends that HHS provide additional guidance and technical assistance to states to address known challenges and enhance their understanding of requirements.

It highlights that these challenges, such as account closures and transfer delays, can impact the implementation of humanitarian assistance projects. The report discusses the decline in correspondent banking relationships, which can lead to underground financial flows, affecting growth, financial inclusion, and system stability. It also outlines the regulatory requirements for U.S. banks, including the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, which are essential for detecting and preventing financial crimes. The report also notes that U.S. banks must comply with these regulations, which can be challenging for organizations working in high-risk areas. It further discusses the impact of U.S. sanctions on certain countries, which can lead to banking access issues for humanitarian projects. The report finds that while most partners experienced delays or denials of funds transfers, the challenges were not significant enough to affect project implementation. However, some projects faced repeated delays or had to reduce the scope of implementation. The report also highlights that USAID's current partner reporting does not capture potential risks posed by banking access challenges.

GAO was asked to review the possible effects of decreased banking access for nonprofit organizations on the delivery of U.S. humanitarian assistance. In this report, GAO examines (1) the extent to which State and USAID partners experienced banking access challenges, (2) USAID partners' reporting on such challenges, and (3) actions U.S. agencies have taken to help address such challenges. GAO selected four high-risk countries—Syria, Somalia, Haiti, and Kenya—based on factors such as their inclusion in multiple financial risk-related indices, and selected a non-generalizable sample of 18 projects in those countries. GAO reviewed documentation and interviewed U.S. officials and the 18 partners for the selected projects. Implementing partners (partners) for 7 of 18 Department of State (State) and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) humanitarian assistance projects that GAO selected noted encountering banking access challenges, such as delays or denials in transferring funds overseas. Of those 7 projects, 1 partner told us that banking access challenges adversely affected its project and 2 additional partners told us that the challenges had the potential for adverse effects. Moreover, the majority of partners (15 out of 18) for the 18 projects noted experiencing banking access challenges on their global portfolio of projects over the previous 5 years. USAID's partners' written reports do not capture potential risks posed by banking access challenges because USAID generally does not require most partners to report in writing any challenges that do not affect implementation. Six of the 7 projects that encountered challenges were USAID-funded. Of those 6 USAID projects, 5 partners told us that these challenges did not rise to the threshold of affecting project implementation that would necessitate reporting, and 1 did not report challenges although its project was adversely affected. Additionally, GAO's review of about 1,300 USAID partner reports found that the few instances where challenges were mentioned lacked sufficient detail for GAO to determine their type, severity, or origin. Without information on banking access challenges that pose potential risks to project implementation, USAID is not aware of the full extent of risks to achieving its objectives. The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and State have taken various actions to help address banking access challenges encountered by nonprofit organizations (NPO), but USAID's efforts have been limited. Treasury's efforts have focused on engagement between NPOs and U.S. agencies, while State has issued guidance on the topic to its embassies and designated an office to focus on these issues. In contrast, USAID lacks a comparable office, and NPOs stated that it is difficult to find USAID staff to engage with on this topic.

The EFMP is designed to help these families by identifying and enrolling eligible family members, coordinating assignments, and providing family support. The program is required for each of the four military services (Air Force, Army, Marine Corps, and Navy) to establish their own EFMP. The EFMP has three components: identification and enrollment, assignment coordination, and family support. The identification and enrollment component is responsible for identifying eligible family members with special medical or educational needs to enroll in the EFMP. Once identified by a qualified medical provider, active duty servicemembers are required to enroll in their service’s EFMP. Servicemembers are also required to self-identify when they learn a family member has a qualifying condition. The assignment coordination component is responsible for considering any family member's special needs during the assignment process, including the availability of required medical and special educational services at a new location. The family support component is responsible for helping families with special needs identify and gain access to programs and services at their current, as well as proposed, locations. Servicemembers assigned to a joint base would receive family support from the Service that is responsible for leading that installation. For example, an Airman assigned to a joint base where the Army is the lead would receive family support from the Army installation’s EFMP. The Office of Special Needs (OSN) is responsible for developing, implementing, and overseeing the EFMP. The report highlights that while the EFMP is in place, there are significant variations in how the services implement and monitor the program. For instance, the Marine Corps specifies a frequency (quarterly) with which families with special needs should be contacted by their family support providers. The Air Force has each installation obtain a roster of families with special needs enrolled in the EFMP on a monthly basis, but it does not require family support providers to, for example, use this information to regularly contact these families. The Navy assigns one of three service levels to each family member enrolled in the EFMP. These service levels are based on the needs of each family with special needs. Family support providers are responsible for assigning a “service level” that directs the frequency with which the family must be contacted. The Army has no requirements for how often families with special needs should be contacted.

This report examines the extent to which (1) each Service provides family support and (2) the Services monitor and DOD evaluates assignment coordination and family support. GAO analyzed DOD and Service-specific EFMP guidance and documents; analyzed fiscal year 2016 EFMP data (the most recent available); visited seven military installations, selected for their large numbers of military-connected students; and interviewed officials responsible for implementing each Service's EFMP, as well as officials in OSN that administer DOD's EFM policy. The support provided to families with special needs through the Department of Defense's (DOD) Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) varies widely for each branch of Military Service. Federal law requires DOD's Office of Special Needs (OSN) to develop a uniform policy that includes requirements for (1) developing and updating a services plan for each family with special needs and (2) resources, such as staffing, to ensure an appropriate number of family support providers. OSN has developed such a policy, but DOD relies on each Service to determine its compliance with the policy. However, Army and Navy officials said they have not received feedback from OSN about the extent to which their Service-specific guidance complies. Federal internal control standards call for developing clear policies to achieve agency goals. In addition, DOD's most recent annual reports to Congress do not indicate the extent to which each Service provides services plans or allocates sufficient resources for family support providers. According to GAO's analysis, the Military Services have developed relatively few services plans, and there is wide variation in the number of family support providers employed, which raises questions about potential gaps in services for families with special needs (see table). Each Service uses various mechanisms to monitor how servicemembers are assigned to installations (assignment coordination) and obtain family support, but DOD has not established common performance measures to assess these activities. DOD has taken steps to better support families with special needs, according to the DOD officials GAO interviewed. For example, DOD established a working group to identify gaps in services. However, OSN officials said that DOD lacks common performance measures for assignment coordination and family support because the Services have not reached consensus on what those measures should be. In addition, OSN does not have a process to systematically evaluate the results of the Services' monitoring activities. Federal internal control standards call for assessing performance over time and evaluating the results of monitoring activities. Without establishing common performance measures and assessing monitoring activities, DOD will be unable to fully determine the effect of its efforts to better support families with special needs and the adequacy of the Services' EFMPs as required by federal law. GAO makes a total of three recommendations to DOD. DOD should assess and report to Congress on the extent to which each Service provides sufficient family support personnel and services plans, develop common performance metrics for assignment coordination and family support, and evaluate the results of the Services' monitoring activities.

It is intended to study the early universe, search for life's building blocks in exoplanets, and trace galaxy evolution. The telescope will operate in an orbit approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth, with a 6.5-meter primary mirror, providing about 10 times the sensitivity of Hubble. To maintain the instruments at extremely cold temperatures, a multi-layered tennis court-sized sunshield is being developed to protect the mirrors and instruments from the sun's heat. The project is divided into three major segments: the observatory, the ground, and the launch segments. The observatory segment includes the Optical Telescope Element (OTE), the Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM), and the spacecraft, along with the sunshield and cryocooler. The project relies on two main contractors: Northrop Grumman and the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy’s Space Telescope Science Institute. Northrop Grumman is responsible for the sunshield, the OTE, the spacecraft, and the Mid-Infrared Instrument’s cryocooler. The Space Telescope Science Institute is responsible for soliciting and evaluating research proposals from the scientific community, and for receiving and storing the scientific data collected, both of which are services that it currently provides for the Hubble Space Telescope. The telescope will be launched on an Ariane 5 rocket, provided by the European Space Agency. The JWST requires 22 deployment events to prepare the observatory for normal operations on orbit. The deployment of the sunshield and primary mirror are designed to fold and stow for launch and deploy once in space. Due to its large size, it is nearly impossible to perform deployment tests of the fully assembled observatory, so the verification of deployment elements is accomplished by a combination of lower level component tests in flight-simulated environments; ambient deployment tests for assembly, element, and observatory levels; and detailed analysis and simulations at various levels of assembly. The JWST project has faced numerous technical challenges and schedule delays, which have been addressed through schedule and cost reserves.

The project has undergone two replans, with the most recent in 2018, which resulted in an increased cost estimate and a delayed launch date. The project has experienced several workmanship issues, such as the damage to the sunshield", "answers": ["JWST, a large, deployable telescope, is one of NASA's most complex projects and top priorities. The project has delayed its planned launch three times since September 2017 due to problems discovered in testing. In June 2018, NASA approved new cost and schedule estimates for JWST. Since the project established its cost and schedule baselines in 2009, the project's costs have increased by 95 percent and the launch date has been moved back by 81 months. Conference Report No. 112-284, accompanying the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012, included a provision for GAO to assess the project annually and report on its progress. This is the seventh report. This report assesses (1) the considerations NASA took into account when updating the project's cost and schedule commitments and (2) the extent to which NASA has taken steps to improve oversight and performance of JWST, among other issues. GAO reviewed relevant NASA policies, analyzed NASA and contractor data, and interviewed NASA and contractor officials. In June 2018, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) revised the cost and schedule commitments for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to reflect known technical challenges, as well as provide additional time to address unanticipated challenges. For example, the revised launch readiness date of March 2021 included 5.5 months to address a design issue for the cover of the sunshield (see image). The purpose of the sunshield is to protect the telescope's mirrors and instruments from the sun's heat. NASA found that hardware on the cover came loose during testing in April 2018. The new cost estimate of $9.7 billion is driven by the schedule extension, which requires keeping the contractor's workforce on board longer than expected. Before the project enters its final phase of integration and test, it must conduct a review to determine if it can launch within its cost and schedule commitments. As part of this review, the project is not required to update its joint cost and schedule confidence level analysis—an analysis that provides the probability the project can meet its cost and schedule commitments—but government and industry cost and schedule experts have found it is a best practice to do so. Such analysis would provide NASA officials with better information to support decisions on allocating resources, especially in light of the project's recent cost and schedule growth. NASA has taken steps to improve oversight and performance of JWST, and identified the JWST project manager as responsible for monitoring the continued implementation of these changes. Examples of recent changes include increasing on-site presence at the contractor facility and conducting comprehensive audits of design processes. Sustaining focus on these changes through launch will be important if schedule pressures arise later and because of past challenges with communications. GAO will follow up on the project's monitoring of these improvements in future reviews. GAO recommends NASA update the project's joint cost and schedule confidence level analysis. NASA concurred with the recommendation made in this report."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5967}

Let me start by reading through the report again to get the main points. \n\nThe report talks about various USDA-FNS programs that provide food to children in institutional settings. The main ones are the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP), which subsidize meals. There's also the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP) and Special Milk Program (SMP). Other programs include the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) and the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP). The last reauthorization was the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA). Some of the authorities expired in 2015, but the programs continued with annual appropriations. The 114th Congress started but didn't finish reauthorization. The House and Senate reported legislation, but it died at the end of the Congress. The 115th Congress didn't have major reauthorization, but the 2018 farm bill had some provisions related to child nutrition programs. The report mentions that the HHFKA and the 2018 farm bill proposals and the final enacted bill included a few provisions related to child nutrition programs. \n\nThe key points are the different programs, their purposes, the HHFKA, the expiration of some authorities, the lack of reauthorization in the 114th and 115th Congresses, and the issues that have arisen, like nutrition standards, sourcing, summer meals, and meal debt. \n\nThe report also discusses the implementation of the HHFKA, the challenges schools faced, and the legislative proposals in the 114th and 115th Congresses. \n\nI need to condense all this into a one-page summary.

These include the school meals programs—the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program—as well as the Child and Adult Care Food Program, Summer Food Service Program, Special Milk Program, and Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program. The most recent child nutrition reauthorization, the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA; P.L. 111-296), made a number of changes to the child nutrition programs. In some cases, these changes spurred debate during the law's implementation, particularly in regard to updated nutrition standards for school meals and snacks. On September 30, 2015, some of the authorities created by the HHFKA expired. Efforts to reauthorize the child nutrition programs in the 114th Congress, while not completed, considered several related issues and prompted further discussion about the programs. There were no substantial reauthorization attempts in the 115th Congress. Current issues discussed in this report include the following: Nutrition standards for school meals and snacks. The HHFKA required USDA to update the nutrition standards for school meals and other foods sold in schools. USDA issued final rules on these standards in 2012 and 2016, respectively. Some schools had difficulty implementing the nutrition standards, and USDA and Congress have taken actions to change certain parts of the standards related to whole grains, sodium, and milk. Offerings in the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP). There have been debates recently over whether the FFVP should include processed and preserved fruits and vegetables, including canned, dried, and frozen items. Currently, statute permits only fresh offerings. \"Buy American\" requirements for school meals. The school meals programs' authorizing laws require schools to source foods domestically, with some exceptions, under Buy American requirements. Efforts both to tighten and loosen these requirements have been made in recent years. The enacted 2018 farm bill (P.L. 115-334) instructed USDA to \"enforce full compliance\" with the Buy American requirements and report to Congress within 180 days of enactment. Congregate feeding in summer meals. Under current law, children must consume summer meals on-site. This is known as the \"congregate feeding\" requirement. Starting in 2010, Congress funded demonstration projects, including the Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) demonstration, to test alternatives to congregate feeding in summer meals. Congress has increased funding for Summer EBT in recent appropriations cycles and there have been discussions about whether to continue or expand the program. Implementation of the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP). The HHFKA created CEP, an option for qualifying schools, groups of schools, and school districts to offer free meals to all students. Because income-based applications for school meals are no longer required in schools adopting CEP, its implementation has created data issues for federal and state programs relying on free and reduced-price lunch eligibility data. Unpaid meal costs and \"lunch shaming.\" The issue of students not paying for meals and schools' handling of these situations has received increasing attention. Some schools have adopted what some term as \"lunch shaming\" practices, including throwing away a student's selected hot meal and providing a cold meal alternative when a student does not pay. Congress and USDA have taken actions recently to reduce instances of student nonpayment and stigmatization. Paid lunch pricing. One result of new requirements in the HHFKA was price increases for paid (full price) lunches in many schools.

{"pred": " The Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund (CSPF) is a multiemployer pension plan that provides defined benefit retirement benefits to workers in the trucking industry. CSPF was established in 1955 to provide pension benefits to International Brotherhood of Teamsters union members in the trucking industry. CSPF is one of the largest multiemployer plans, and it has faced significant financial challenges. CSPF was the subject of investigations by the IRS, DOL, and DOJ in the 1970s. These investigations led to the establishment of a consent decree in 1982, which remains in effect today. The consent decree outlines the roles and responsibilities of the parties involved, including the court, the court-appointed independent special counsel, DOL, the plan and its board of trustees, and the named fiduciary. The CSPF has been under the consent decree, the plan has been managed by an independent asset manager, called the named fiduciary.

CSPF is one of the nation's largest multiemployer defined benefit pension plans, covering about 385,000 participants. Since 1982, the plan has operated under a court-enforceable consent decree which, among other things, requires that the plan's assets be managed by independent parties. Within 7 years, CSPF estimates that the plan's financial condition will require severe benefit cuts. GAO was asked to review the events and factors that led to the plan's critical financial status and how its investment outcomes compare to similar plans. GAO describes (1) what is known about the factors that contributed to CSPF's critical financial condition; (2) what has been CSPF's investment policy, and the process for setting and executing it, since the consent decree was established; and (3) how CSPF's investments have performed over time, particularly compared to similar pension plans. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations; interviewed CSPF representatives, International Brotherhood of Teamsters officials and members, federal officials, and knowledgeable industry stakeholders; reviewed CSPF documentation including investment policy statements and board of trustee meeting minutes; and analyzed investment returns and fees from required, annual pension plan filings and from consultant benchmarking reports. The Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund (CSPF) was established in 1955 to provide pension benefits to trucking industry workers, and is one of the largest multiemployer plans. According to its regulatory filings, CSPF had less than half the estimated funds needed to cover plan liabilities in 1982 at the time it entered into a court-enforceable consent decree that provides for oversight of certain plan activities. Since then, CSPF has made some progress toward achieving its targeted level of funding; however, CSPF has never been more than 75 percent funded and its funding level has weakened since 2002, as shown in the figure below. Stakeholders GAO interviewed identified numerous factors that contributed to CSPF's financial condition. For example, stakeholders stated that changes within the trucking industry as well as a decline in union membership contributed to CSPF's inability to maintain a healthy contribution base. CSPF's active participants made up about 69 percent of all participants in 1982, but accounted for only 16 percent in 2016. The most dramatic change in active participants occurred in 2007 when the United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) withdrew from the plan. At that time, UPS accounted for about 30 percent of the plan's active participants (i.e. workers). In addition, the market declines of 2001 to 2002 and 2008 had a significant negative impact on the plan's long-term investment performance. Stakeholders noted that while each individual factor contributed to CSPF's critical financial condition, the interrelated nature of the factors also had a cumulative effect on the plan's financial condition. Both CSPF's investment policy and the process for setting and executing it have changed several times since the consent decree was established in 1982. The original consent decree gave an independent asset manager—called a named fiduciary—exclusive authority to set and change the plan's investment policies and manage plan assets, and prohibited CSPF trustees from managing assets or making investment decisions. Initially, the named fiduciaries sold the troubled real estate assets acquired during the pre-consent decree era. Subsequent changes include the following: In 1993, the named fiduciaries started to increase investment in equities, and their policies continued to direct that asset allocations be weighted toward equities until early 2017. Between 2003 and 2010, the court approved three plan decisions to move a total of 50 percent of CSPF's assets into passively-managed accounts (passive management typically seeks to match the performance of a specific market index and reduce investment fees). An early-2017 investment policy change precipitated by CSPF's deteriorating financial condition will continue to move plan assets into fixed income investments ahead of projected insolvency, or the date when CSPF is expected to have insufficient assets to pay promised benefits when due. As a result, assets will be gradually transitioned from “return-seeking assets”—such as equities and emerging markets debt—to high-quality investment grade debt and U.S. Treasury securities with intermediate and short-term maturities. The plan is projected to become insolvent on January 1, 2025. CSPF officials and named fiduciary representatives said these changes are intended to reduce the plan's exposure to market risk and volatility, and provide participants greater certainty prior to projected insolvency. GAO found that CSPF's investment returns and expenses were generally in line with similarly sized institutional investors and with demographically similar multiemployer pension plans. For example, GAO's analysis of returns using the peer group measure used by CSPF known as the Wilshire Associates' Trust Universe Comparison Service (TUCS), showed that CSPF's annual investment returns since 1995 were above the median about as many times as they were below. Similarly, comparing CSPF's returns to a peer group of similar multiemployer defined benefit plans using federally required annual reports found that CSPF's annual investment returns were in line with those of its peers. Specifically, CSPF's annual returns were above the median nine times and below it six times—and CSPF's overall (dollar-weighted) average annual return from 2000 through 2014 was close to that of the peer median average return of 4.8 percent. In addition, GAO found that CSPF's investment fees and other administrative expenses have also been in line with other large multiemployer plans. For example: CSPF's investment fees as a percentage of assets were about 9 percent lower than the median of large defined benefit multiemployer plans over the 2000 through 2014 period—though much of that difference is accounted for by a relative reduction in investment fees since 2007. CSPF's investment fees as a percentage of assets were, on average, about 34 basis points (or 0.34 percent). CSPF's administrative expenses related to the day-to-day operations of the plan have also been in line with other large multiemployer plans. CSPF's administrative expenses per participant were below the median for large defined benefit multiemployer plans for 12 of the 15 years over the 2000 through 2014 period. As of 2014, CSPF's administrative expense was $98 per participant, which is about 16 percent less than the median for large defined benefit multiemployer plans.

The Choice Program was set to sunset on June 6, 2019, but the VA MISSION Act of 2018 extended it for one year. The program was administered by two TPAs, Health Net and TriWest, who managed networks of providers and processed claims. The TPAs had issues with payment timeliness, including delays in processing clean claims and handling non-clean claims. VA and TPAs identified three key factors affecting payment timeliness: (1) VA's untimely payment of TPA invoices, which led to providers not being paid on time. (2) Choice Program contractual requirements related to provider reimbursement, such as the medical documentation requirement and the timely filing requirement. (3) Inadequate provider education on filing Choice Program claims. VA's untimely payment of TPA invoices caused providers to have insufficient funds to pay providers.

You asked GAO to review issues related to the timeliness of TPAs' payments to community providers under the Choice Program. This report examines, among other things, (1) the length of time TPAs have taken to pay community providers' claims and factors affecting timeliness of payments, and (2) actions taken by VA and the TPAs to reduce the length of time TPAs take to pay community providers for Choice Program claims. GAO reviewed TPA data on the length of time taken to pay community provider claims from November 2014 through June 2018, the most recent data available at the time of GAO's review. GAO also reviewed documentation, such as the contracts between VA and its TPAs, and interviewed VA and TPA officials. In addition, GAO interviewed a non-generalizable sample of 15 community providers, selected based on their large Choice Program claims volume, to learn about their experiences with payment timeliness. The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Choice Program (Choice Program) was created in 2014 to address problems with veterans' timely access to care at VA medical facilities. The Choice Program allows eligible veterans to obtain health care services from providers not directly employed by VA (community providers), who are then reimbursed for their services through one of the program's two third-party administrators (TPA). GAO's analysis of TPA data available for November 2014 through June 2018 shows that the length of time the TPAs took to pay community providers' clean claims each month varied widely—from 7 days to 68 days. VA and its TPAs identified several key factors affecting timeliness of payments to community providers under the Choice Program, including VA's untimely payments to TPAs, which in turn extended the length of time TPAs took to pay community providers' claims; and inadequate provider education on filing claims. VA has taken actions to address key factors that have contributed to the length of time TPAs have taken to pay community providers. For example, VA updated its payment system and related processes to pay TPAs more quickly. According to VA data, as of July 2018, VA was paying at least 90 percent of the TPAs' invoices within 7 days. In addition, VA and the TPAs have taken steps to improve provider education to help providers resolve claims processing issues. However, 9 of the 15 providers GAO interviewed said they continue to experience lengthy telephone hold times. According to VA and TPA officials, steps have been taken to improve the customer service offered to community providers. However, VA officials do not collect data on or monitor TPA compliance with customer service requirements—such as calls being answered within 30 seconds or less—for provider calls because they said they are not enforcing the requirements and are allowing TPAs to prioritize calls from veterans. Without collecting data and monitoring compliance, VA does not have information on challenges providers may face when contacting TPAs to resolve payment issues.

WMATA, established in 1967 through an interstate compact involving the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia, operates six rail lines, covering 118 linear miles of guideway. The agency's capital investments are funded by a combination of federal grants and state and local contributions, with the federal share being about 55% of the total. From 2011 to 017, WMATA received approximately $5.8 billion in capital funding, with $3.2 billion from the federal government and $2.4 billion from states and localities. Additionally, WMATA took on about $230 million in long-term debt to finance its capital program during this time. The report highlights that WMATA's capital planning process, which includes developing a Capital Needs Inventory, an annual capital budget, and a Six-Year Capital Improvement Program. The report also discusses the federal, state, and local funding sources, including the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 (PRIIA), which authorized $1.5 billion in funding for WMATA, available in increments over 10 years beginning in fiscal year 2009.

WMATA initiated a new preventive maintenance program for its rail track in 2017, and is currently implementing a new capital planning process. GAO was asked to examine issues related to WMATA's capital funding and maintenance practices. This report examines: (1) how WMATA spent its capital funds from fiscal years 2011 through 2017, (2) how WMATA's new capital planning process addresses weaknesses it identified in the prior process, and (3) WMATA's progress toward its track preventive maintenance program's goals and how the program aligns with leading program management practices. GAO analyzed WMATA's financial and program information, interviewed officials of WMATA, the Federal Transit Administration, and five transit agencies selected for similarities to WMATA. GAO compared WMATA's capital planning process and track maintenance program with leading practices. From fiscal years 2011 through 2017, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) spent almost $6 billion on a variety of capital assets, with the largest share spent on improving its rail and bus fleet (see figure). Over this period, WMATA's capital spending was, on average, about $845 million annually. WMATA's new capital planning process could address some weaknesses it identified in the prior process. WMATA established a framework for quantitatively prioritizing capital needs (investments to a group of related assets) over a 10-year period. However, WMATA has not established documented policies and procedures for implementing the new process, such as those for selecting specific projects for funding in its annual capital budget. WMATA is currently using its new capital planning process to make fiscal year 2020 investment decisions. WMATA has proposed a fiscal year 2020 capital budget of $1.4 billion. Without documented policies and procedures for implementing the new planning process, WMATA's stakeholders do not have reasonable assurance that WMATA is following a sound process for making investment decisions. WMATA has made significant progress toward its track preventive maintenance program's goals, which are to reduce both track-defect and electrical-fire incidents by 50 percent in fiscal year 2019 compared with 2017. In fiscal year 2018, WMATA met its goal for reducing track defect incidents and reduced electrical fire incidents by 20 percent. However, in designing the program, WMATA did not fully assess risks. For example, WMATA did not quantitatively assess the impact of track defects or electrical fires on its ability to provide service, nor did it consider other risks such as non-electrical track fires, which represent about 30 percent of all fires on the system, or other factors, such as resources or track time. Without a comprehensive risk assessment, WMATA lacks reasonable assurance that the program is designed to address risks affecting the safety of the rail system or other risks that could hinder the new program's success. GAO is making five recommendations, including that WMATA establish documented policies and procedures for the new capital planning process and conduct a comprehensive risk assessment for the track preventive maintenance program.

The evolution of U.S. leadership and the global trade agenda remain of interest to Congress, which holds constitutional authority over foreign commerce and establishes trade negotiating objectives and principles through legislation. Congress has recognized the World Trade Organization (WTO) as the \"foundation of the global trading system\" within trade promotion authority (TPA) and plays a direct legislative and oversight role over WTO agreements. The statutory basis for U.S. WTO membership is the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (P.L. 103-465), and U.S. priorities and objectives for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)/WTO have been reflected in various TPA legislation since 1974. Congress also has oversight of the U.S. Trade Representative and other agencies that participate in WTO meetings and enforce WTO commitments. The WTO is a 164-member international organization that was created to oversee and administer multilateral trade rules, serve as a forum for trade liberalization negotiations, and resolve trade disputes. The United States was a major force behind the establishment of the WTO in 1995, and the rules and agreements resulting from multilateral trade negotiations. The WTO encompassed and succeeded the GATT, established in 1947 among the United States and 22 other countries. Through the GATT and WTO, the United States, with other countries, sought to establish a more open, rules-based trading system in the postwar era, with the goal of fostering international economic cooperation and raising economic prosperity worldwide. Today, 98% of global trade is among WTO members. The WTO is a consensus and member-driven organization. Its core principles include nondiscrimination (most favored nation treatment and national treatment), freer trade, fair competition, transparency, and encouraging development. These are enshrined in a series of WTO trade agreements covering goods, agriculture, services, intellectual property rights, and trade facilitation, among other issues. Some countries, including China, have been motivated to join the WTO not just to expand access to foreign markets but to spur domestic economic reforms, help transition to market economies, and promote the rule of law. The WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) provides an enforceable means for members to resolve disputes over WTO commitments and obligations. The WTO has processed more than 500 disputes, and the United States has been an active user of the dispute settlement system. Supporters of the multilateral trading system consider the dispute settlement mechanism an important success of the system. At the same time, some members, including the United States, contend it has procedural shortcomings and has exceeded its mandate in deciding cases. Many observers are concerned that the effectiveness of the WTO has diminished since the collapse of the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations, which began in 2001, and believe the WTO needs to adopt reforms to continue its role as the foundation of the global trading system. To date, WTO members have been unable to reach consensus for a new comprehensive multilateral agreement on trade liberalization and rules. While global supply chains and technology have transformed international trade and investment, global trade rules have not kept up with the pace of change. Many countries have turned to negotiating free trade agreements (FTAs) outside the WTO as well as plurilateral agreements involving subsets of WTO members rather than all members. At the latest WTO Ministerial conference in December 2017, no major deliverables were announced. Several members committed to make progress on ongoing talks, such as fisheries subsidies and e-commerce, while other areas remain stalled. While many were disappointed by the limited progress, in the U.S. view, the outcome signaled that \"the impasse at the WTO was broken,\" paving the way for groups of like-minded countries to pursue new work in other key areas. Certain WTO members have begun to explore aspects of reform and future negotiations. Potential reforms concern the administration of the organization, its procedures and practices, and attempts to address the inability of WTO members to conclude new agreements. Proposed DS reforms also attempt to improve the working of the dispute settlement system, particularly the Appellate Body—the seven-member body that reviews appeals by WTO members of a panel's findings in a dispute case. Some U.S. frustrations with the WTO are not new and many are shared by other trading partners, such as the European Union. At the same time, the Administration's overall approach has spurred new questions regarding the future of U.S. leadership and U.S. priorities for improving the multilateral trading system. Concerns have emphasized that the Administration's recent actions to unilaterally raise tariffs under U.S. trade laws and to possibly impede the functioning of the dispute settlement system might undermine the credibility of the WTO system. A growing question of some observers is whether the WTO would flounder for lack of U.S. leadership, or whether other WTO members like the EU and China taking on larger roles would continue to make it a meaningful actor in the global trade environment. The growing debate over the role and future direction of the WTO may be of interest to Congress. Important issues it may address include how current and future WTO agreements affect the U.S. economy, the value of U.S. membership and leadership in the WTO, whether new U.S. negotiating objectives or oversight hearings are needed to address prospects for new WTO reforms and rulemaking, and the relevant authorities and impact of potential U.S. withdrawal from the WTO on U.S. economic and foreign policy interests."], "all_classes": null, "length": 21561}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is about improper payments in the federal government and the steps agencies must take under IPIA, IPERA, and IPERIA. \n\nFirst, the report mentions that executive branch agencies have to do several things: risk assessments, develop estimates, analyze root causes, and report. There's a figure that outlines these steps. Then, there are six agencies reviewed, with ten programs. The report explains that these programs are managed by different agencies. \n\nThe agencies are required to use statistical methods or other approved methods. Some agencies use alternative methods, like the Department of Education for Direct Loan, and HHS for Medicaid. Also, some agencies include actual improper payments in their estimates. \n\nThe report also talks about how agencies sample data to test for improper payments. The data sampled varies by program, including payments, claims, tax returns, and pay accounts. For example, DOD samples invoices for Defense Finance and Accounting Service Commercial Pay, HHS samples medical claims for Medicare Fee-for-Service, and DOD samples pay accounts for Military Pay. \n\nThere are differences in the age of the data used for estimates. Some agencies use data from previous years, while others use data from the current fiscal year. OMB guidance allows this with approval. \n\nThe report then discusses specific programs: DOD's Military Pay and OPM's Retirement. For DOD, their testing processes have limitations. They don't test eligibility for special pay or allowances. They rely on monthly reviews and add actual debts from overpayments. However, these processes may not fully address key risks of improper payments, such as eligibility for special pay or allowances. \n\nThe OMB guidance is mentioned, but it doesn't address how agencies test to identify improper payments, like using a risk-based approach. Without such guidance, agencies may not address key risks of improper payments in their programs, which could affect the accuracy of the estimates and their usefulness for corrective actions. \n\nThe report also mentions that some agencies are not fully assessing the risks in their programs and evaluating if their methods for estimating improper payments are effective. \n\nThe report ends with recommendations to OMB, DOD, OPM, and IRS. \n\nSo, the summary needs to capture the key points: the requirements under the laws, the steps agencies must take, the review of specific programs, the issues with current processes, and the recommendations. \n\nI need", "answers": ["Improper payments—which include payments that should not have been made or were made in an incorrect amount—are a long-standing, significant problem in the federal government, estimated at almost $141 billion for fiscal year 2017. Executive branch agencies are required to annually estimate improper payments for certain programs. Estimation of improper payments is key to understanding the extent of the problem and to developing effective corrective actions. Relevant laws and guidance provide agencies flexibility in developing estimates. This report describes agencies' processes to estimate improper payments in selected programs for fiscal year 2017 and the extent to which certain differences in these processes can affect the usefulness of the resulting estimates. GAO selected 10 programs across six agencies with the largest reported program outlays in fiscal years 2015 and 2016. For these programs, GAO reviewed relevant laws and guidance, analyzed agencies' policies and procedures, and interviewed officials at relevant agencies and OMB staff. The six agencies GAO reviewed reported taking various approaches related to key components of estimating improper payments—shown in the figure below—for 10 selected programs, which collectively reported outlays of over $2.5 trillion for fiscal year 2017. Sample selection. Eight of the 10 programs GAO reviewed reported using statistically valid approaches, and the remaining 2 reported using alternative methodologies approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The sampled data elements varied, including payments, medical claims, and tax returns. The age of the data used to develop fiscal year 2017 improper payment estimates also varied, ranging from calendar year 2013 to fiscal year 2017. Identification of improper payments. Some of the six agencies reported using processes designed specifically to estimate improper payments, whereas others reported leveraging existing reviews. These agencies' policies and procedures include a review of aspects of eligibility, except for those related to the Department of Defense's (DOD) Military Pay and the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Retirement overpayments. DOD and OPM have not fully assessed whether their estimation processes effectively consider key program risks. OMB guidance does not specifically address how agencies are to test to identify improper payments, such as using a risk-based approach to help ensure that key risks of improper payments are addressed. The six agencies also varied in the treatment of insufficient documentation, both in identifying and in reporting the root causes of improper payments. For the agencies that contact entities outside the agency to estimate improper payments, the treatment of nonresponse differed, with one agency including nonresponses as improper payments and another generally excluding the nonresponse cases from review. Although OMB guidance states that agencies should treat cases of insufficient documentation as improper payments, it does not specifically address the treatment of nonresponse cases. Calculation of the improper payment estimate. The six agencies generally reported using law and OMB guidance to calculate improper payment estimates for the selected programs, except for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) removed overpayments that were recovered when developing its estimate. OMB guidance requires agencies to include recovered amounts in their estimates. Removing these overpayments understates the EITC improper payment estimate and may limit IRS's ability to develop corrective actions to prevent improper payments. GAO recommends that OMB develop guidance on treatment of nonresponse cases and testing to identify improper payments, that DOD and OPM assess their estimation processes, and that IRS revise its methodology to not exclude recovered payments from its estimate. All of the agencies either agreed or partially agreed with the specific recommendations to them.

The Coast Guard's TAP program is managed by 13 installations, with one or two TAP managers assigned to each of the nine districts, overseeing operations for their regions. The program manager in Coast Guard Headquarters oversees the program. The Coast Guard, which is under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), not the Department of Defense (DOD), is responsible for TAP implementation for its servicemembers. Federal law mandates that both DOD and DHS require eligible servicemembers under their command to participate in TAP, with some exceptions. The Coast Guard has not issued any regulations to implement TAP, unlike DOD. The last Commandant Instruction on TAP was issued in 2003, eight years before the TAP redesign in 2011. In 2014, the Coast Guard issued updated policy guidance, but the new Commandant Instruction is not yet issued, and is expected in May 2018. The Coast Guard's TAP program is structured to provide pre-separation or transition counseling, required courses, and additional 2-day classes. The program manager in Coast Guard Headquarters manages the program. The Coast Guard protects over 100,000 miles of U.S. coastline and inland waterways, and TAP-eligible Coast Guard servicemembers sometimes work in small, widely dispersed units assigned to remote locations, including on Coast Guard vessels. The Coast Guard's mission as a first responder for maritime search and rescue in U.S. waters can require Coast Guard servicemembers to respond to emergency situations at a moment's notice. The Coast Guard, which is overseen by DHS, not DOD, generally oversees TAP implementation for its servicemembers. The report highlights that the Coast Guard lacks a current Commandant Instruction, which is essential for defining roles and responsibilities, and ensuring data completeness and accuracy. The Coast Guard's TAP data are not reliable due to the absence of a standardized data collection system. The data are updated on an ad-hoc basis, and may not be timely or complete. For example, one TAP manager said she updates the list of TAP participants for her installation only once every few months because of her other duties. The Coast Guard lacks a formal performance goal for TAP participation, which is required by federal law. The report also discusses the Coast Guard's lack of reliable data", "answers": ["Thousands of Coast Guard servicemembers have left the military and transitioned into civilian life, and some of these new veterans may face significant challenges, such as finding and maintaining employment. To help them prepare, federal law mandated that DHS provide separating Coast Guard servicemembers with counseling, employment assistance, and information on veterans' benefits through TAP. GAO was asked to examine TAP implementation. This review analyzes (1) the reliability of TAP data on participation levels for Coast Guard servicemembers and the factors that affect participation, and (2) the Coast Guard's performance measures and monitoring efforts related to TAP. GAO interviewed Coast Guard headquarters staff; surveyed 12 Coast Guard installations that conduct TAP (100 percent response rate); collected and reviewed participation data for reliability; and interviewed TAP managers from three installations selected for size and location, and 25 Coast Guard servicemembers at one location. (For a companion report on TAP implementation for separating and retiring servicemembers in other military services, see GAO-18-23 .) The United States Coast Guard (Coast Guard), which is overseen by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), lacks complete or reliable data on participation in the Transition Assistance Program (TAP), designed to assist servicemembers returning to civilian life. According to senior Coast Guard officials, a major reason why data are not reliable is the lack of an up-to-date Commandant Instruction that specifies when to record TAP participation data. Consequently, the data are updated on an ad-hoc basis and may not be timely or complete, according to officials. Federal internal control standards call for management to use quality information to achieve the entity's objectives. Until the Coast Guard issues an up-to-date Commandant Instruction that establishes policies and procedures to improve the reliability and completeness of TAP data, it will lack quality information to gauge the extent to which it is meeting TAP participation requirements in the VOW to Hire Heroes Act of 2011. According to GAO's survey of Coast Guard installations, various factors affected participation, such as servicemembers serving at geographically remote locations or separating from the Coast Guard rapidly. TAP officials and Coast Guard servicemembers GAO interviewed said commanders and direct supervisors sometimes pulled servicemembers out of TAP class or postponed participation because of mission priorities. TAP managers also said they rely on delivering TAP online because many Coast Guard servicemembers are stationed remotely. The Coast Guard cannot effectively measure performance to ensure key TAP requirements are met because it lacks reliable data and does not monitor compliance with several TAP requirements. Further, the Coast Guard has not established a formal performance goal against which it can measure progress, although federal internal control standards stipulate that management should consider external requirements—such as the laws with which the entity is required to comply—to clearly define objectives in specific and measurable terms. Establishing a goal could help the Coast Guard define expected performance. In addition, the Coast Guard does not monitor TAP requirements regarding the timeliness of servicemembers' TAP participation or their access to additional 2-day classes. Consequently, it cannot know whether servicemembers are starting TAP early enough to complete the program or those who elected to attend additional 2-day classes were able to do so before separation or retirement, as required by the Act. Finally, the Coast Guard lacks an up-to-date Commandant Instruction that establishes the roles and responsibilities of Coast Guard staff in implementing TAP. Federal internal control standards stipulate that management should assign responsibility and delegate authority to key roles throughout the entity. Issuing an up-to-date Commandant Instruction that defines roles and responsibilities would clarify who is ultimately responsible for ensuring Coast Guard servicemembers attend TAP, thereby facilitating accountability. GAO is making seven recommendations, including that the Coast Guard issue a new Commandant Instruction establishing data collection policies, set TAP performance goals, monitor timeliness and access, and define roles and responsibilities.

{"pred": " (One page, 500 words)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is from the NRC and discusses radiation doses, their effects, and federal regulations. \n\nFirst, the report mentions that higher radiation doses lead to quicker effects and higher death probability. It references the atomic bomb survivors in Japan, who developed cancers like leukemia and colon cancer, and acute radiation syndrome with symptoms like nausea and vomiting. Low-dose radiation effects are harder to detect, and below 100 mSv, the data isn't clear on cancer risk. \n\nThe federal agencies like EPA, NRC, DOE, and FDA rely on scientific advisory bodies for radiation protection. They use the linear no-threshold model, which assumes cancer risk increases with every small dose. The National Academies 2006 report supported this model, and more data strengthened the estimates. However, there are challenges in estimating cancer risks from very low doses, especially when using data from non-U.S. populations like Japanese survivors, whose acute exposure might not be directly applicable to chronic low-dose U.S. exposure. \n\nDespite these challenges, agencies continue to use the model unless there's a strong recommendation. For example, NRC's annual dose limit for the public is much lower than the National Academies' low-dose threshold. They also apply ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) principle. \n\nThe report also talks about research funding. From 2012 to 2016, seven agencies spent $209.6 million on low-dose radiation research, but they didn't use a collaborative mechanism to set priorities. DOE and NIH were the main funders. Funding decreased by 48% over the period. DOE reduced its funding for the Low Dose Radiation Research Program, shifting focus to bioenergy and environmental research. NIH's funding also decreased, citing factors like proposal quality and peer review outcomes. \n\nThe agencies collaborated on specific projects, but not on overall priorities. The report mentions that the 2016 DOE report highlighted research needs in low-dose radiation and that other agencies could benefit from this research. \n\nThe GAO made a recommendation that the Secretary of Energy lead the development of a collaborative mechanism for interagency coordination on low-dose research. However, DOE disagreed, stating that EPA and NRC also have mandates and that DOE would not lead the development of such a mechanism.", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's September 2017 report, entitled Low-Dose Radiation: Interagency Collaboration on Planning Research Could Improve Information on Health Effects ( GAO-17-546 ). The Department of Energy (DOE), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Food and Drug Administration generally used the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public in the radiation exposure settings that GAO reviewed. These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas. GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research . Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.

{"pred": " The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) of 1977 was enacted to address concerns that federally insured banks were not adequately meeting the credit needs of the communities where they were chartered. The law aims to ensure that banks serve the convenience and needs of their service areas, particularly low- and moderate-income (LMI) neighborhoods. Under the CRA, federal banking regulators conduct examinations to assess whether banks are meeting local credit needs. Banks that engage in qualifying activities—such as mortgage, consumer, and business lending; community investments; and low-cost services that would benefit LMI areas and entities—receive credits, or points, which are used to determine a bank's composite CRA rating. These ratings are then considered when banks apply for charters, branches, mergers, or acquisitions. The CRA was designed to prevent redlining practices, where banks deny credit to certain neighborhoods or individuals based on discriminatory practices. The law applies to banks with FDIC-insured deposits, such as national banks and state-chartered banks, but not to credit unions or other nonbank entities. The CRA requires federal banking regulators to evaluate the extent to which regulated institutions are effectively meeting the credit needs within their designated assessment areas, including LMI neighborhoods, in a manner consistent with the federal prudential regulations for safety and soundness. The CRA's impact on lending activity has been debated. Some argue that the CRA may lead banks to forgo more profitable lending opportunities in non-targeted neighborhoods by encouraging a disproportionate amount of lending in LMI communities. Others are concerned that the CRA compels banks to make loans to higher-risk borrowers that are more likely to have repayment problems, which may subsequently compromise the financial stability of the banking system. For example, some researchers have attributed the increase in risky lending prior to the 2007-2009 recession to banks attempting to comply with CRA objectives. Others are concerned that enforcement of CRA objectives has not been stringent enough to compel banks to increase financial services in LMI areas. Almost all banks receive Satisfactory or better performance ratings on their CRA examinations, which some may consider indicative of weak enforcement. This report explores the CRA's role in encouraging bank lending and investment to LMI customers. It begins by explaining CRA examinations, including how a bank defines its assessment area; the activities that may qualify for points under the three tests (lending, investment, and service) that collectively make up the CRA examination; and how the composite CRA rating is calculated. Next, the report analyzes the difficulty in attributing bank lending", "answers": ["The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA; P.L. 95-128, 12 U.S.C. §§2901-2908) addresses how banking institutions meet the credit needs of the areas they serve, particularly in low- and moderate-income (LMI) neighborhoods. The federal banking regulatory agencies—the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)—currently implement the CRA. The regulators issue CRA credits, or points, where banks engage in qualifying activities—such as mortgage, consumer, and business lending; community investments; and low-cost services that would benefit LMI areas and entities—that occur with a designated assessment area. These credits are then used to issue each bank a performance rating. The CRA requires these ratings be taken into account when banks apply for charters, branches, mergers, and acquisitions among other things. The CRA, which was enacted in 1977, was subsequently revised in 1989 to require public disclosure of bank CRA ratings to establish a four-tiered system of descriptive performance levels (i.e., Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve, or Substantial Noncompliance). In 1995, the CRA examination was customized to account for differences in bank sizes and business models. In 2005, the bank size definitions were revised and indexed to the Consumer Price Index. The 2005 amendments also expanded opportunities for banks to earn CRA credit for public welfare investments (such as providing housing, services, or jobs that primarily benefit LMI individuals). Qualifying activities under the CRA have evolved to include consumer and business lending, community investments, and low-cost services that would benefit LMI areas and entities. Congressional interest in the CRA stems from various perceptions of its effectiveness. Some have argued that, by encouraging lending in LMI neighborhoods, the CRA may also encourage the issuance of higher-risk loans to borrowers likely to have repayment problems (under the presumption that low-income is correlated with lower creditworthiness), which can translate into losses for lenders. Others are concerned that the CRA is not generating sufficient incentives to increase credit availability to qualified LMI borrowers, which may impede economic recovery for some, particularly following the 2007-2009 recession. This report informs the congressional debate concerning the CRA's effectiveness in incentivizing bank lending and investment activity to LMI borrowers. After a discussion of the CRA's origins, it presents the CRA's examination process and bank activities that are eligible for consideration of CRA credits. Next, it discusses the difficulty of determining the CRA's influence on bank behavior. For example, the CRA does not specify the quality and quantity of CRA-qualifying activities, meaning that compliance with the CRA does not require adherence to lending quotas or benchmarks. In the absence of benchmarks, determining the extent to which CRA incentives have influenced LMI credit availability relative to other factors is not straightforward. Banks also face a variety of financial incentives—for example, capital requirements, the prevailing interest rate environment, changes in tax laws, and technological innovations—that influence how much (or how little) they lend to LMI borrowers. Because multiple financial profit incentives and CRA incentives tend to exist simultaneously, it is difficult to determine the extent to which CRA incentives have influenced LMI credit availability relative to other factors."], "all_classes": null, "length": 7111}

The VA's budget for fiscal year 2018 is $186.4 billion, which includes both discretionary and mandatory funding. The report outlines the various offices and agencies within the VA that are involved in addressing misconduct, including the Office of Human Resource Management (OHRM), Office of Accountability Review (OAR), Office of Inspector General (OIG), Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection (OAWP), Corporate Senior Executive Management Office (CSEMO), Client Services Response Team (CSRT), and others. The report also details the process for addressing employee misconduct, including the receipt of allegations, review and referral of allegations, and notice to the employee. The report highlights the challenges in collecting and analyzing misconduct data across VA's various systems. The VA has multiple information systems that track employee misconduct and disciplinary actions, but these systems are not fully integrated or interoperable. The report identifies 12 fragmented information systems that VA has used or continues to use to collect employee misconduct and disciplinary action data. These systems are not able to communicate with each other to provide a complete picture of misconduct and disciplinary actions across VA. The report also identifies data quality issues in the data collected from these systems. The report found that the data collected from these systems are not reliable for a department-wide assessment of all misconduct and disciplinary actions due to the lack of completeness and compatibility of the data across all information systems. The report also discusses the lack of standardization in the data fields and the lack of identifiers. The report outlines the recommendations to improve the data collection and analysis processes. The VA has a significant number of employees, and the report highlights the need for better data management and oversight to ensure accountability and fair treatment of employees who report misconduct.\nOkay, I need to create a one-page summary of this lengthy VA report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points.\n\nThe report starts by explaining the structure of the VA, which includes the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), and National Cemetery Administration (NCA). It mentions the number of employees in each administration, with VHA having the most. Then there", "answers": ["VA provides services and benefits to veterans through hospitals and other facilities nationwide. Misconduct by VA employees can have serious consequences for some veterans, including poor quality of care. GAO was asked to review employee misconduct across VA. This report reviews the extent to which VA (1) collects reliable information associated with employee misconduct and disciplinary actions, (2) adheres to documentation-retention procedures when adjudicating cases of employee misconduct, (3) ensures allegations of misconduct involving senior officials are reviewed according to VA investigative standards and these officials are held accountable, and (4) has procedures to investigate whistle-blower allegations of misconduct; and the extent to which (5) data and whistle-blower testimony indicate whether retaliation for disclosing misconduct occurs at VA. GAO analyzed 12 information systems across VA to assess the reliability of misconduct data, examined a stratified random sample of 544 misconduct cases from 2009 through 2015, analyzed data and reviewed cases pertaining to senior officials involved in misconduct, reviewed procedures pertaining to whistle-blower investigations, and examined a nongeneralizable sample of whistle-blower disclosures from 2010 to 2014. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) collects data related to employee misconduct and disciplinary actions, but fragmentation and data-reliability issues impede department-wide analysis of those data. VA maintains six information systems that include partial data related to employee misconduct. For example, VA's Personnel and Accounting Integrated Data system collects information on disciplinary actions that affect employee leave and pay, but the system does not collect information on other types of disciplinary actions. The system also does not collect information such as the offense or date of occurrence. GAO also identified six other information systems that various VA administrations and program offices use to collect specific information regarding their respective employees' misconduct and disciplinary actions. GAO's analysis of all 12 information systems found data-reliability issues—such as missing data, lack of identifiers, and lack of standardization among fields. Without collecting reliable misconduct and disciplinary action data on all cases department-wide, VA's reporting and decision making on misconduct are impaired. VA inconsistently adhered to its guidance for documentation retention when adjudicating misconduct allegations, based on GAO's review of a generalizable sample of 544 out of 23,622 misconduct case files associated with employee disciplinary actions affecting employee pay. GAO estimates that VA would not be able to account for approximately 1,800 case files. Further, GAO estimates that approximately 3,600 of the files did not contain required documentation that employees were adequately informed of their rights during adjudication procedures—such as their entitlement to be represented by an attorney. The absence of files and associated documentation suggests that individuals may not have always received fair and reasonable due process as allegations of misconduct were adjudicated. Nevertheless, VA's Office of Human Resource Management does not regularly assess the extent to which files and documentation are retained consistently with applicable requirements. VA did not consistently ensure that allegations of misconduct involving senior officials were reviewed according to investigative standards and these officials were held accountable. For example, based on a review of 23 cases of alleged misconduct by senior officials that the VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) referred to VA facility and program offices for additional investigation, GAO found VA frequently did not include sufficient documentation for its findings, or provide a timely response to the OIG. In addition, VA was unable to produce any documentation used to close 2 cases. Further, OIG policy does not require the OIG to verify the completeness of investigations, which would help ensure that facility and program offices had met the requirements for investigating allegations of misconduct. Regarding senior officials, VA did not always take necessary measures to ensure they were held accountable for substantiated misconduct. As the figure below shows, GAO found that the disciplinary action proposed was not taken for 5 of 17 senior officials with substantiated misconduct. As a result of June 2017 legislation, a new office within VA—the Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection—will be responsible for receiving and investigating allegations of misconduct involving senior officials. VA has procedures for investigating whistle-blower complaints, but the procedures allow the program office or facility where a whistle-blower has reported misconduct to conduct the investigation. According to the OIG, it has the option of investigating allegations of misconduct, or exercising a “right of first refusal” whereby it refers allegations of misconduct to the VA facility or program office where the allegation originated. VA does not have oversight measures to ensure that all referred allegations of misconduct are investigated by an entity outside the control of the facility or program office involved in the misconduct, to ensure independence. As a result, GAO found instances where managers investigated themselves for misconduct, presenting a conflict of interest. Data and whistle-blower testimony indicate that retaliation may have occurred at VA. As the table below shows, individuals who filed a disclosure of misconduct with the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) received disciplinary action at a much higher rate than the peer average for the rest of VA in fiscal years 2010–2014. Additionally, GAO's interviews with six VA whistle-blowers who claim to have been retaliated against provided anecdotal evidence that retaliation may be occurring. These whistle-blowers alleged that managers in their chain of command took several untraceable actions to retaliate against the whistle-blowers, such as being denied access to computer equipment necessary to complete assignments. GAO makes numerous recommendations to VA to help enhance its ability to address misconduct issues (several of the recommendations are detailed on the following page). GAO recommends, among other things, that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs develop and implement guidance to collect complete and reliable misconduct and disciplinary-action data department-wide; such guidance should include direction and procedures on addressing blank fields, lack of personnel identifiers, and standardization among fields; direct applicable facility and program offices to adhere to VA's policies regarding misconduct adjudication documentation; direct the Office of Human Resource Management to routinely assess the extent to which misconduct-related files and documents are retained consistently with applicable requirements; direct the Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection (OAWP) to review responses submitted by facility or program offices to ensure evidence produced in senior-official case referrals demonstrates that the required elements have been addressed; direct OAWP to issue written guidance on how OAWP will verify whether appropriate disciplinary action has been implemented; and develop procedures to ensure (1) whistle-blower investigations are reviewed by an official independent of and at least one level above the individual involved in the allegation, and (2) VA employees who report wrongdoing are treated fairly and protected against retaliation. GAO also recommends, among other things, that the VA OIG revise its policy and require verification of evidence produced in senior-official case referrals. VA concurred with nine recommendations and partially concurred with five. In response, GAO modified three of the recommendations. The VA OIG concurred with one recommendation and partially concurred with the other. GAO continues to believe that both are warranted."], "all_classes": null, "length": 22296}

The agency's mission is to ensure that the American people have available, \"without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex, a rapid, efficient, Nationwide, and worldwide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.\" The Communications Act of 1934 is divided into titles, each addressing different aspects of the FCC's authority. Title I outlines the FCC's administration and powers, while Title II deals with common carrier regulation, Title III with broadcast station requirements, Title IV with procedural and administrative provisions, Title V with penal provisions, Title VI with cable communications, and Title VII with miscellaneous provisions. The FCC is responsible for overseeing a variety of communications services, including broadcast, cable, satellite, and wireless. The agency is divided into 7 bureaus and 10 offices, each with specific responsibilities. The bureaus handle tasks such as license applications, complaints, investigations, and regulatory programs, while the offices provide support services. The FCC's current strategic plan, covering FY2018-FY2022, outlines four main goals: closing the digital divide, promoting innovation, protecting consumers and public safety, and reforming the FCC's processes. The plan emphasizes reducing regulatory burdens, enhancing market efficiency, and fostering competition. The FCC is funded through regulatory fees collected from license holders and other entities, rather than through direct appropriation. The FCC has faced significant changes in its leadership and strategic goals, particularly with the shift in the political party of the chairman. The FCC's strategic goals have evolved over time, as seen in the comparison of the strategic goals under former Chairman Tom Wheeler and current Chairman Ajit Pai. The FCC's strategic goals reflect the regulatory philosophies of the FCC chairmen, with Wheeler advocating for regulation to protect the public interest, and Pai promoting market efficiency and reducing regulatory burdens. The FCC's strategic goals are set forth in the quadrennial Strategic Plan.

The strategic goals have evolved over time, as", "answers": ["The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent federal agency established by the Communications Act of 1934 (1934 Act, or \"Communications Act\"). The agency is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable. The mission of the FCC is to make available for all people of the United States, \"without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex, a rapid, efficient, Nationwide, and worldwide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.\" The FCC operates under a public interest mandate first laid out in the 1927 Radio Act (P.L. 632, 69th Congress), but how this mandate is applied depends on how \"the public interest\" is interpreted. Some regulators seek to protect and benefit the public at large through regulation, while others seek to achieve the same goals through the promotion of market efficiency. Additionally, Congress granted the FCC wide latitude and flexibility to revise its interpretation of the public interest standard to reflect changing circumstances and the agency has not defined it in more concrete terms. These circumstances, paired with changes in FCC leadership, have led to significant changes over time in how the FCC regulates the broadcast and telecommunications industries. The FCC is directed by five commissioners appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for five-year terms. The President designates one of the commissioners as chairperson. Three commissioners may be members of the same political party of the President and none can have a financial interest in any commission-related business. The current commissioners are Ajit Pai (Chair), Michael O'Rielly, Brendan Carr, Jessica Rosenworcel, and Geoffrey Starks. The day-to-day functions of the FCC are carried out by 7 bureaus and 10 offices. The current basic structure of the FCC was established in 2002 as part of the agency's effort to better reflect the industries it regulates. The seventh bureau, the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau, was established in 2006. The bureaus process applications for licenses and other filings, manage non-federal spectrum, analyze complaints, conduct investigations, develop and implement regulatory programs, and participate in hearings, among other things. The offices provide support services. Bureaus and offices often collaborate when addressing FCC issues. Beginning in the 110th Congress, the FCC has been funded through the House and Senate Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) appropriations bill as a single line item. Previously, it was funded through what is now the Commerce, Justice, Science appropriations bill, also as a single line item. Since 2009 the FCC's budget has been derived from regulatory fees collected by the agency rather than through a direct appropriation. The fees, often referred to as \"Section (9) fees,\" are collected from license holders and certain other entities. The FCC is authorized to review the regulatory fees each year and adjust them to reflect changes in its appropriation from year to year. Most years, appropriations language prohibits the use by the commission of any excess collections received in the current fiscal year or any prior years. For FY2020, the FCC has requested $335,660,000 in budget authority from regulatory fee offsetting collections. The FCC also requested $132,538,680 in budget authority for the spectrum auctions program."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3388}
{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report about emergency powers in the U.S. Let me start by reading through the report again to get the main points.\n\nThe report starts by explaining that the President has various emergency powers under federal law, not just for war. These powers come from the Constitution or statutes. Some are always available, others are standby and need a proclamation to activate. Congress can change or end these powers. Before WWI, Presidents used emergency powers on their own. Then, with the war, more standby powers were available. But in 1976, the National Emergencies Act was passed, which set procedures for declaring emergencies and using powers. The report also mentions historical context, like how emergency powers were first used during the Revolutionary War, and how the Constitutional Convention didn't focus much on emergency powers. But the Constitution's Article I, Section 8, and other clauses allow for implied powers. Philosophers like John Locke influenced the Founding Fathers, arguing that in emergencies, the executive can act broadly for the public good, even if not in war. \n\nThen there's the part about Lincoln's use of emergency powers during the Civil War, which was controversial. Congress didn't challenge him, and the Supreme Court didn't either. Then there's the part about the Senate special committee in 1973, which identified 470 provisions of federal law that delegate emergency powers. The National Emergencies Act of 1976 established procedures for declaring emergencies and using powers. \n\nThe report also discusses the definition of a national emergency, which is sudden, unforeseen, and threatening to life and well-being. It includes examples like the 1933 banking crisis, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. The National Emergencies Act of 1976 (probably a typo, should be 1976) set procedures for declaring emergencies and using powers. \n\nThe report goes into the history of emergency powers, from the Continental Congress to the National Emergencies Act, which introduced a process for declaring emergencies and using powers. It also mentions the National Emergencies Act of 1976 (probably a typo, should be 1976) which established procedures for declaring emergencies and using powers. \n\nThe report ends with a note about a specific case in 2005 where the President used a different statute instead", "answers": ["The President of the United States has available certain powers that may be exercised in the event that the nation is threatened by crisis, exigency, or emergency circumstances (other than natural disasters, war, or near-war situations). Such powers may be stated explicitly or implied by the Constitution, assumed by the Chief Executive to be permissible constitutionally, or inferred from or specified by statute. Through legislation, Congress has made a great many delegations of authority in this regard over the past 230 years. There are, however, limits and restraints upon the President in his exercise of emergency powers. With the exception of the habeas corpus clause, the Constitution makes no allowance for the suspension of any of its provisions during a national emergency. Disputes over the constitutionality or legality of the exercise of emergency powers are judicially reviewable. Both the judiciary and Congress, as co-equal branches, can restrain the executive regarding emergency powers. So can public opinion. Since 1976, the President has been subject to certain procedural formalities in utilizing some statutorily delegated emergency authority. The National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. §§1601-1651) eliminated or modified some statutory grants of emergency authority, required the President to formally declare the existence of a national emergency and to specify what statutory authority activated by the declaration would be used, and provided Congress a means to countermand the President's declaration and the activated authority being sought.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report about USPS's competitive products. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the key points. \n\nThe report starts by talking about USPS's competitive products, which have grown significantly from 2008 to 2017. The volume went from 750 million to 4.9 billion pieces, and revenue from these products increased from 10% to 28% of total mail revenue. The growth is attributed to e-commerce, especially last-mile delivery. USPS exceeded revenue expectations by $500 million in 2017. However, they face competition in first- and last-mile services. \n\nUSPS uses scanning technology and manual scans to track packages. They have a goal of 100% scanning accuracy. The report mentions that USPS has a high scanning rate, but some missed or inaccurate scans occur. For example, in 2017, 1.9 million delivery scans were done at the post office instead of the delivery address. These issues can affect millions of items. \n\nThe report also discusses USPS's scanning procedures and the lack of internal control standards. They don't follow the COSO Framework or Federal Government Standards. Instead, they rely on their own practices. However, the report found that USPS's procedures are inconsistent, leading to scanning errors. \n\nThere are recommendations made to the Postmaster General, like adopting internal control standards, improving communication of procedures, and creating SOPs for managers. However, USPS disagrees with the first recommendation, saying they need a cost study. \n\nI need to condense all this into a one-page summary. Let me structure it: \n\n1. Introduction: USPS's competitive products growth, e-commerce impact, revenue increase.\n2. Scanning processes: automation, manual scans, barcode info, 13 scans.\n3. Scanning performance: high accuracy, but some errors.\n4. Inconsistency in procedures and lack of detailed SOPs.\n5. Recommendations and USPS's response.\n6. Conclusion: Importance of internal controls for USPS's competitiveness.\n\nI should make sure to mention the key stats (volume and revenue growth), the role of e-commerce, the scanning technology used, the issues with missed scans, the lack of internal control standards, and the recommendations. Also, note that USPS is not adopting the recommendations yet, but is planning a cost study. \n\nI need to keep it concise, maybe 3-4 paragraphs", "answers": ["USPS's competitive products have become increasingly important, comprising about 28 percent of USPS's total revenue. USPS scans these packages at various points throughout the postal network. When scans are inaccurate or missing, questions are raised about the veracity of USPS's data on scanning performance and can lead to customer complaints. GAO was asked to review USPS's scanning policies and procedures. In this report, GAO (1) describes USPS's scanning performance and (2) examines how USPS ensures accurate scanning. GAO reviewed USPS's policies and procedures and assessed them against internal control standards; interviewed officials from USPS and five high-volume mailers; and conducted site visits to six post offices in two USPS districts that represented a range of volume, number of routes, and performance. Mail products over which the United States Postal Service (USPS) does not exercise market dominance, such as many of its packages, are called competitive products. These items are scanned throughout the mail delivery system to track their progress (see figure). USPS data show that these products are almost always scanned. For example, USPS data showed that for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2018; all but one of USPS's 67 districts met their scanning goals. Additionally, mailers that account for a high volume of USPS's competitive products told GAO that they believed USPS was generally scanning products correctly. However, a small percentage of missed or inaccurate scans occur. For example, a report from one USPS district showed that for one week, 0.73 percent of the products delivered were missing a scan and that for the fiscal year to date almost 155,000 competitive products were missing a delivery scan. USPS has designed and implemented procedures and activities to help ensure accurate scanning, but some limitations could contribute to scanning errors. For example, USPS has not based its operational procedures for scanning on any internal control standards. USPS officials said the procedures were based on USPS's unique responsibilities, management experience, and sound business practices, but the officials could not identify specific standards or a framework that they followed as the basis for the procedures. USPS officials said they did not believe any internal controls standards applied to these procedures. By not basing procedures on standards, USPS may miss opportunities to improve how it achieves its mission to scan and measure the performance of competitive products. Additionally, USPS's scanning procedure documents, such as for outlining specific delivery scanning steps, are not always consistent, and USPS relies on more informal methods, such as meetings with employees to communicate changes. Thus, employees may not have accurate procedures available to them. Finally, USPS lacks procedures to help managers identify and address incorrect scans, address customer complaints or otherwise address scanning irregularities. For example, USPS's guidance for managers is limited to a list of bullet-points that do not detail the steps managers should follow to resolve scanning irregularities. In addition, this list has not been updated since 2005. Without consistent or detailed procedures, USPS's employees and managers may not scan items accurately or find information needed to resolve scanning issues—a situation that could hinder USPS's ability to reduce inaccurate or missing scans for these important mail products. GAO recommends that USPS: (1) identify and adopt internal control standards for its operational activities such as for scanning of competitive products; (2) improve the communication of procedures for scanning competitive products; and, (3) create procedures for supervisors on how to address inaccurate scans and resolve scanning issues. USPS agreed to explore addressing the first recommendation and agreed with the other two recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5486}

The report is about NASA's mission and their major projects, specifically focusing on three space telescopes: WFIRST, TESS, and JWST. It talks about the life cycle of NASA's space flight projects, which has phases from formulation to implementation. The key points include the process of project confirmation, cost and schedule reserves, and the challenges faced by these projects.\n\nFirst, the report starts by explaining NASA's mission and the types of projects they undertake. Then it goes into the life cycle phases, from A to F, with key decision points. The project confirmation at decision point C is where cost and schedule baselines are established. The JCL (Joint Cost and Schedule Confidence Level) is a point-in-time estimate that includes all cost and schedule elements, incorporates and quantifies known risks, assesses the impacts of cost and schedule to date, and addresses available annual resources. NASA requires projects to be baselined at 70% confidence level. The reserves are at project and headquarters level. Cost reserves are for costs not yet allocated to specific parts. Schedule reserves are extra time for specific activities.\n\nThen the report details each of the three projects. WFIRST is in the early stages, with a cost estimate of $3.2B to $3.8B. It's a wide-field imaging telescope. The project is evaluating components to reuse or modify. TESS is a smaller project with a cost estimate of $337M, launching in March 2018. It's for exoplanet survey. JWST is the most complex, with a cost of $8.835B. It's designed to study the universe's origin, first stars and galaxies, and star formation. It has a 6.5m mirror, much more sensitive than Hubble. The instruments need to operate at extremely cold temps, so a sunshield is being developed. The report mentions that JWST has had significant cost increases and schedule delays. Prior to being approved for development, cost estimates ranged from $1B to $3.5B, with expected launch dates from 2007 to 2011. Before 2011, early technical and management challenges, contractor performance issues, low levels of cost reserves, and poorly phased funding levels caused JWST to delay work after confirmation, which contributed to significant cost", "answers": ["Acquisition management has been a long-standing challenge at NASA, although GAO has reported on improvements the agency has made in recent years. Three space telescope projects are the key enablers for NASA to achieve its astrophysics' science goals, which include seeking to understand the universe. In its fiscal year 2018 budget request, NASA asked for about $697 million for these three projects, which represents over 50 percent of NASA's budget for its astrophysics' major projects. In total, these projects represent an expected investment of at least $12.4 billion. This statement reflects preliminary observations on (1) the current status and cost of NASA's major telescope projects and (2) lessons learned that can be applied to NASA's management of its telescope projects. This statement is based on ongoing work on JWST and ongoing work on the status of NASA's major projects. Both reports are planned to be published in Spring 2018. This statement is also based on past GAO reports on JWST and NASA's acquisitions of major projects, and NASA input. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) current portfolio of major space telescopes includes three projects that vary in cost, complexity, and phase of the acquisition life cycle. GAO's ongoing work indicates that these projects are each making progress in line with their phase of the acquisition cycle but also face some challenges. For example, the current launch date for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) project reflects a 57-60-month delay from the project's original schedule. GAO's preliminary observations indicate this project still has significant integration and testing to complete, with very little schedule reserve remaining to account for delays. Therefore, additional delays beyond the delay of up to 8 months recently announced are likely, and funding available under the $8 billion Congressional cost cap for formulation and development may be inadequate. There are a number of lessons learned from its acquisitions that NASA could consider to increase the likelihood of successful outcomes for its telescope projects, as well as for its larger portfolio of projects, such as its human spaceflight projects. For example, twice in the history of the JWST program, independent reviews found that the program was not holding adequate cost and schedule reserves. GAO has found that NASA has not applied this lesson learned to all of its large projects, and similar outcomes to JWST have started to emerge. For example, NASA did not incorporate this lesson with its human spaceflight programs. In July 2016 and April 2017, GAO found that these programs were holding inadequate levels of cost and schedule reserves to cover unexpected cost increases or delays. In April 2017, GAO recommended that NASA reassess the date of the programs' first test flight. NASA concurred and, in November 2017, announced a launch delay of up to 19 months.

{"pred": " The report provides an in-depth analysis of the U.S. Small Business Administration's (SBA) Surety Bond Guarantee Program, which was established in 1971 under the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1970. The program is designed to help small businesses obtain surety bonds, which are required for federal contracts exceeding $150,000. The SBA guarantees these bonds, which reduces the risk for the surety company and allows small businesses to compete for contracts. The program allows contractors to secure contracts up to $6.5 million, and up to $10 million if a federal contracting officer certifies the necessity. The SBA guarantees up to 90% of the surety's loss if a default occurs. In FY2018, the SBA guaranteed 10,800 bid and final surety bonds with a total contract value of nearly $6.5 billion. The program's legislative origin is in the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1970, which authorized the SBA to guarantee surety bonds up to $500,000. The program has a bond limit that has been adjusted for inflation, and the guarantee percentage has been modified over time. The SBA's guarantee currently ranges from 80% to 90% of the surety's loss if a default occurs. The program has been a subject of congressional interest, especially regarding its size and effectiveness in supporting small businesses, particularly minority and women-owned businesses. The report discusses the program's evolution, including the introduction of the Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Program (PSB program) which offered lower guarantee rates in exchange for allowing preferred sureties to issue bonds without SBA approval. It also covers the legislative changes, such as the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, which increased the guarantee rate to 90%. The report provides performance statistics, including the number and amount of bond guarantees issued annually. It also includes data on the number and amount of final bonds guaranteed from FY1971 through FY2017 (Table A-1) and for bid and final bonds combined from FY2000 through FY2017 (Table A-2). The program's eligibility criteria include the small business size standard, the requirement for the bond, the applicant's ability to obtain the bond without the guarantee, and the expectation of performance. The report also examines the program's current fee structure, including contractor", "answers": ["The Small Business Administration's (SBA's) Surety Bond Guarantee Program is designed to increase small businesses' access to federal, state, and local government contracting, as well as private-sector contracts, by guaranteeing bid, performance, and payment bonds for small businesses that cannot obtain surety bonds through regular commercial channels. The program guarantees individual contracts of up to $6.5 million, and up to $10 million if a federal contracting officer certifies that such a guarantee is necessary. The SBA's guarantee currently ranges from 80% to 90% of the surety's loss if a default occurs. In FY2018, the SBA guaranteed 10,800 bid and final surety bonds with a total contract value of nearly $6.5 billion. A surety bond is a three-party instrument between a surety (who agrees to be responsible for the debt or obligation of another), a contractor, and a project owner. The agreement binds the contractor to comply with the contract's terms and conditions. If the contractor is unable to successfully perform the contract, the surety assumes the contractor's responsibilities and ensures that the project is completed. Surety bonds encourage project owners to contract with small businesses that may not have the credit history or prior experience of larger businesses and may be at greater risk of failing to comply with the contract's terms and conditions. Surety bonds are important to small businesses interested in competing for federal contracts because the federal government requires prime contractors—prior to the award of a federal contract exceeding $150,000 for the construction, alteration, or repair of any building or public work of the United States—to furnish a performance bond issued by a surety satisfactory to the contracting officer in an amount that the officer considers adequate to protect the government. P.L. 112-239, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, increased the program's bond limit to $6.5 million, or up to $10 million if a federal contracting officer certifies that such a guarantee is necessary. The limit had been $2 million since 2000, with a temporary increase from February 17, 2009, through September 30, 2010, to $5 million, and up to $10 million if a federal contracting officer certified in writing that such a guarantee was necessary. Advocates of raising the program's bond limit argued that doing so would increase contracting opportunities for small businesses and bring the limit more in line with limits of other small business programs, such as the 8(a) Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development Program and the Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Program. Opponents argued that raising the limit could lead to higher amounts being guaranteed by the SBA and, as a result, increase the risk of program losses. This report examines the program's origin and development, including (1) the decision to supplement the original Prior Approval Program with the Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Program that initially provided a lower guarantee rate (not to exceed 70%) than the Prior Approval Program (not to exceed 80% or 90%, depending on the size of the contract and the type of small business) in exchange for allowing preferred sureties to issue SBA-guaranteed surety bonds without the SBA's prior approval; (2) P.L. 114-92, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, which increased the Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Program's guarantee rate from not to exceed 70% to not to exceed 90% of losses; and (3) the decision to increase the program's bond limit."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8920}
{"pred": " The report outlines the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) requirements for lobbyists in the United States, focusing on registration, reporting, and compliance. Under the LDA, lobbyists must register with the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House and file quarterly reports detailing their lobbying activities. These reports are submitted electronically through a single entry point and are made publicly available in searchable databases. While the LDA does not mandate specific documentation for the information disclosed, the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House recommends retaining copies of filings and supporting documentation for at least six years. The guidance, last updated in January 2017, includes updates to registration thresholds, clarification on client identification, and rounding of income and expenses. The LDA defines a lobbyist as someone who is employed or retained by a client for compensation, who has made more than one lobbying contact, and whose lobbying activities represent at least 20% of the time spent on behalf of the client during the quarter. Lobbying firms are required to register with the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House for each client if the firm receives or expects to receive more than $3,000 in income from that client for lobbying activities. The report also discusses the process for submitting these reports, including the LD-2 form, which includes details such as the name of the lobbyist, the client, the issue areas, the lobbying contacts, and the income and expenses. The report highlights that while most lobbyists provide documentation for their reports, there are some challenges, such as rounding of income and expenses, and some confusion about the need to disclose certain positions. The report found that in 2017, 99% of the reports had documentation for income and expenses, which is a significant increase from 2016.

The law also includes a provision for GAO to annually audit lobbyists' compliance with the LDA. GAO's objectives were to (1) determine the extent to which lobbyists can demonstrate compliance with disclosure requirements, (2) identify challenges to compliance that lobbyists report, and (3) describe the resources and authorities available to USAO in its role in enforcing LDA compliance, and the efforts USAO has made to improve enforcement. This is GAO's 11th report under the provision. GAO reviewed a stratified random sample of 98 quarterly disclosure LD-2 reports filed for the third and fourth quarters of calendar year 2016 and the first and second quarters of calendar year 2017. GAO also reviewed two random samples totaling 160 LD-203 reports from year-end 2016 and midyear 2017. This methodology allowed GAO to generalize to the population of 45,818 disclosure reports with $5,000 or more in lobbying activity, and 30,594 reports of federal political campaign contributions. GAO also met with officials from USAO to obtain status updates on its efforts to focus resources on lobbyists who fail to comply. GAO is not making any recommendations in this report. GAO provided a draft of this report to the Department of Justice for review and comment. The Department of Justice provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. For the 2017 reporting period, most lobbyists provided documentation for key elements of their disclosure reports to demonstrate compliance with the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, as amended (LDA). For lobbying disclosure (LD-2) reports and political contributions (LD-203) reports filed during the third and fourth quarter of 2016 and the first and second quarter of 2017, GAO estimates that 87 percent of lobbyists filed reports as required for the quarter in which they first registered; the figure below describes the filing process and enforcement; 99 percent of all lobbyists who filed (up from 83 percent in 2016) could provide documentation for income and expenses; and 93 percent filed year-end 2016 LD-203 reports as required. These findings are generally consistent with prior reports GAO issued for the 2010 through 2016 reporting periods. However, in recent years GAO's findings showed some variation in the estimated percentage of reports with supporting documentation. For example, an estimated increase in lobbyists who could document expenses is notable in 2017 and represents a statistically significant increase from 2016. As in GAO's other reports, some lobbyists were still unclear about the need to disclose certain previously held covered positions, such as paid congressional internships or certain executive agency positions. GAO estimates that 15 percent of all LD-2 reports may not have properly disclosed previously held covered positions. On the other hand, over the past several years of reporting on lobbying disclosure, GAO found that most lobbyists in the sample rated the terms associated with LD-2 reporting as “very easy” or “somewhat easy” to understand. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia (USAO) stated it has sufficient resources and authority to enforce compliance with the LDA.

{"pred": " The report provides an overview of the Small Business Administration (SBA) and its programs, focusing on appropriations and funding trends since FY2000. The SBA administers various programs to support small businesses, including loan guaranty and venture capital programs to improve access to capital, contracting programs to increase opportunities in federal contracting, direct loan programs for businesses, homeowners, and renters to aid in recovery from natural disasters, and management and technical assistance training programs to assist in business formation and expansion. Congressional interest in these programs has increased, driven by the belief that small businesses can stimulate economic activity and create jobs. The report examines the SBA's appropriations, including total available funds and actual and anticipated expenditures for its entrepreneurial development noncredit programs. SBA appropriations have varied significantly from year to year and across three major spending categories: disaster assistance, business loan credit subsidies, and \"other programs,\" which includes salaries and expenses, business loan administration, the Office of Inspector General, the Office of Advocacy, and entrepreneurial development noncredit programs. The variation in appropriations for disaster assistance since FY2000 is largely due to supplemental appropriations provided to address disaster needs arising from the impact of major hurricanes. Business loan credit subsidies represent the net present value of cash flows to and from the SBA over the life of the agency's loan portfolios. For guaranteed loans, the net present value of cash flows is affected by several factors, but it is primarily the difference between the cost of purchasing loans that have defaulted and the revenue generated from fees and collateral liquidation. For direct (Microloan) lending, it is primarily the cost of offering below-market interest rates to Microloan intermediaries. The variation in appropriations for business loan credit subsidies since FY2000 is primarily due to the impact of changing economic conditions on the SBA's guaranteed loan portfolios. During good economic times, revenue from fees and collateral liquidation is typically sufficient to cover the SBA's cost of purchasing guaranteed loans that have defaulted. During and immediately following economic slowdowns, however, revenue from fees and collateral liquidation is typically insufficient to cover those costs. The shortfall occurs because the SBA's cost of purchasing guaranteed loans tends to increase when the economy slows (primarily because guaranteed loans are more likely to default during and immediately following recessions) and revenue from loan liquidation tends to be constrained during slow economic times (primarily because commercial real estate values typically fall during and immediately following recessions).

Overall, the SBA's appropriations have ranged from a high of $2.359 billion in FY2018 to a low of $571.8 million in FY2007. Much of this volatility is due to significant variation in appropriations for disaster assistance, which ranged from a high of $1.7 billion in FY2006 to a low of $0 in FY2009. This variation can be attributed primarily to supplemental appropriations provided to address disaster needs arising from the impact of major hurricanes, such as Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, and more recently, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.

During and immediately following recessions, however, that revenue is typically insufficient to cover the costs of purchasing guaranteed loans that have defaulted. The SBA's appropriations for other programs, as a collective, have also varied since FY2000, ranging from a high of $1.6253 billion in FY2010 to a low of $455.6 million in FY2007. This variation is primarily due to congressional response to changing economic conditions. For example, Congress approved significant, temporary increases in appropriations for the SBA's other programs spending category in FY2009 and FY2010. Overall, since FY2000, appropriations for other programs have increased at a pace that exceeds inflation.

{"pred": " The report provides an overview of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund (Trust Fund), which provides financial and medical assistance to miners and their dependents affected by black lung disease. In fiscal year 2017, the Trust Fund had about $4.3 billion in outstanding debt, with 25,700 beneficiaries receiving benefits. The Trust Fund is funded primarily through a coal tax, which is imposed at two rates depending on whether the coal is extracted from underground or surface mines. The coal tax is currently set at $1.10 per ton of underground-mined coal and $0.55 per ton of surface-mined coal, up to 4.4 percent of the sales price. The Trust Fund's revenue has been declining due to the scheduled 2019 tax rate decrease and the overall decline in coal production. The Trust Fund's expenditures have consistently exceeded its revenue, leading to the accumulation of debt. The Trust Fund's debt has been increasing due to the scheduled 2019 tax rate decrease and the decline in coal production. The Trust Fund's debt is expected to increase from fiscal year 2019 through 2050 due to the scheduled 2019 tax rate decrease and the decline in coal production. The Trust Fund's debt is projected to increase from about $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2019 to about $15.4 billion in fiscal year 2050. The Trust Fund's debt is expected to increase from about $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2019 to about $15.4 billion in fiscal year 2050. The Trust Fund's debt is anticipated to increase from approximately $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2019 to roughly $15.4 billion in fiscal year 2050.

The Trust Fund's debt is anticipated", "answers": ["With revenue of about $450 million in fiscal year 2017, the Trust Fund paid about $184 million in benefits to more than 25,000 coal miners and eligible dependents. However, the Trust Fund also borrowed about $1.3 billion from the Treasury's general fund in fiscal year 2017 to cover its debt repayment expenditures. Adding to this financial challenge, the coal tax that supports the Trust Fund is scheduled to decrease by about 55 percent beginning in 2019. GAO was asked to review the financial positon of the Trust Fund and identify options to improve it. This report examines (1) factors that have challenged the financial position of the Trust Fund since its inception and (2) the extent to which Trust Fund debt may change through 2050, and selected options that could improve its future financial position. GAO reviewed Trust Fund financial data from fiscal years 1979 through 2017. GAO also interviewed officials from the Departments of Labor, Treasury, Health and Human Services (HHS) and representatives of coal industry and union groups. Using assumptions, such as the about 55 percent coal tax decrease and moderately declining coal production, GAO simulated the extent to which Trust Fund debt may change through 2050. GAO also simulated how selected options, such as forgiveness of debt, could improve finances. The options simulated are not intended to be exhaustive. Further, GAO is not endorsing any particular option or combination of options. GAO provided a draft of this report to DOL, Treasury, and HHS. The agencies provided technical comments, which were incorporated as appropriate. Multiple factors have challenged Black Lung Disability Trust Fund (Trust Fund) finances since it was established about 40 years ago. Its expenditures have consistently exceeded its revenues, interest payments have grown, and actions taken that were expected to improve Trust Fund finances did not completely address its debt. When necessary to make expenditures, the Trust Fund borrows with interest from the Department of the Treasury's (Treasury) general fund. Because Trust Fund expenditures have consistently exceeded revenue, it has borrowed almost every year since 1979, its first complete fiscal year, and as a result debt and interest payments increased. Legislative actions were taken over the years including (1) raising the rate of the coal tax that provides Trust Fund revenues and (2) forgiving debt. For example, the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 provided an appropriation toward Trust Fund debt forgiveness; about $6.5 billion was forgiven, according to Department of Labor (DOL) data (see figure). However, coal tax revenues were less than expected due, in part, to the 2008 recession and increased competition from other energy sources, according to DOL and Treasury officials. As a result, the Trust Fund continued to borrow from Treasury's general fund from fiscal years 2010 through 2017 to cover debt repayment expenditures. GAO's simulation suggests that Trust Fund borrowing will likely increase from fiscal years 2019 through 2050 due, in part, to the coal tax rate decrease of about 55 percent that will take effect in 2019 and declining coal production. The simulation estimates that Trust Fund borrowing may exceed $15 billion by 2050 (see figure). However, various options, such as adjusting the coal tax and forgiving interest or debt, could reduce future borrowing and improve the Trust Fund's financial position. For example, maintaining the current coal tax rates and forgiving debt of $2.4 billion could, under certain circumstances, balance the Trust Fund by 2050, whereby revenue would be sufficient to cover expenditures. However, a coal industry representative said that maintaining or increasing the coal tax would burden the coal industry, particularly at a time when coal production has been declining. Further, Treasury officials noted that the costs associated with forgiving Trust Fund interest or debt would be paid by taxpayers."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5783}
{"pred": " \n\nThe report examines how selected federal agencies assess whether personal property is needed and how they dispose of unneeded property, with a focus on how space reduction efforts have influenced these processes. Federal agencies manage a wide range of personal property, from common items like computers and furniture to specialized equipment such as scientific devices and heavy machinery. The report highlights that while agencies have policies for tracking accountable property (those with a useful life of over two years and a certain value threshold), they lack systematic processes for identifying unneeded property. According to the law, agencies must continuously survey their property to find excess, but the review found that most agencies rely on \"triggering events\" like office moves or equipment upgrades to determine if property is still needed. This reactive approach may lead to retaining property that is no longer required for operational purposes, resulting in potential waste and inefficiencies. \n\nThe report outlines the government-wide personal property disposal process, which begins when an agency declares an item as \"excess.\" Once declared excess, the property can be transferred, donated, sold, or abandoned/destroyed. The process involves four stages: transfer, donation, sale, and abandonment/ destruction. If no eligible entity requests the property for transfer within 21 days, the property becomes surplus, and may be sold to the public or destroyed. \n\nThe report also discusses the Freeze the Footprint and Reduce the Footprint initiatives, which have led to significant space reductions in the federal government. As agencies continue to reduce office and warehouse space, they will likely need to manage or dispose of personal property, such as office furniture or stored items, from these spaces. \n\nThe review found that while agencies have policies for tracking accountable property, they generally do not have policies or processes for identifying unneeded property. This lack of proactive assessment may result in retaining property that is no longer required for operational purposes, leading to potential waste and inefficiencies. \n\nThe report concludes that while agencies are required to maintain inventory controls and accountability systems, they often lack the systematic approach needed to effectively identify and dispose of unneeded property.

By law, each agency is required to follow GSA's disposal process so that an agency's unneeded property can be used by other agencies or certain non-federal entities. Since 2012, agencies have reduced their office and warehouse space due to government-wide initiatives, a reduction that in turn has required agencies to dispose of some affected personal property. GAO was asked to review how federal agencies identify and dispose of unneeded personal property. This report examines (1) how selected agencies assess whether personal property is needed and (2) how these agencies dispose of unneeded property and how, if at all, space reduction efforts have affected disposals. GAO reviewed federal statutes and regulations, and selected five agencies—EPA, Forest Service, GSA, HUD, and IRS—mainly based on space reduction results and goals. GAO reviewed these agencies' property disposal data for 2012 through 2016 and interviewed headquarters and field staff about their property management and disposal processes. The five agencies GAO reviewed—the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Forest Service, General Services Administration (GSA), Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and Internal Revenue Service (IRS)—generally do not have policies or processes for identifying unneeded personal property, such as office furniture, on a proactive basis. Instead, officials from these agencies said they typically identified unneeded property as a result of a “triggering event,” such as an office space reduction. Executive agencies are required by law to continuously review property under their control to identify unneeded personal property and then dispose of it promptly. Without such policies or processes, agencies may not be routinely identifying unneeded property that could be used elsewhere, and efforts to maximize federal personal property use and minimize unnecessary storage costs may not be effective. GSA has issued regulations establishing a government-wide disposal process for unneeded personal property. However, according to GSA officials, the agency lacks the authority to promulgate regulations or formal guidance on management of in-use agency property, and there is no government-wide guidance to agencies on identifying unneeded personal property. Agencies are required to have internal control activities—such as policies and procedures—for reasonable assurance of efficient operations and minimal resource waste, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides guidance to agencies on implementing such activities. Guidance from OMB that emphasizes agencies' internal control responsibilities could help ensure that agencies are proactively and regularly identifying property that is no longer needed. The selected agencies reported little difficulty in following GSA's personal property disposal process, reporting over 37,000 items as unneeded property in fiscal years 2012 through 2016. This property was disposed of through transfers to other agencies, donations to authorized recipients, sales, or discarding. When disposing of personal property from space reduction projects at locations GAO visited, agencies also reported using GSA's process (see figure). Overall, agencies said they have not experienced major challenges with disposing of personal property from space reduction efforts. This lack of challenges could be because projects are geographically dispersed and spread over several years. OMB should provide guidance to executive agencies on managing their personal property, emphasizing that agencies' policies or processes should reflect the requirement to continuously review and identify unneeded personal property.

GAO analyzed documents and interviewed officials from State, USAID, HHS, USDA, and the organizations. GAO also analyzed a nongeneralizable sample of 12 of the 60 assistance agreements that were awarded by State, USAID, HHS, and USDA to OAS, PAHO, and IICA and were active during calendar years 2014 through 2016. For each agency, GAO selected three agreements with the lowest, median, and highest dollar value. GAO found that strategic goals of the Organization of American States (OAS), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA), and the Pan-American Institute of Geography and History (PAIGH) are predominantly aligned with the strategic goals of the Department of State (State), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). For example, IICA's strategic goals of a productive agricultural sector, enhancing agricultural development, and food security are aligned with USDA's foreign assistance goals. State, USAID, HHS, and USDA fund activities in the form of assistance agreements (e.g., grants and cooperative agreements) with OAS, PAHO, and IICA, which in 2016 totaled $32 million. According to agency officials, the agencies employ mechanisms to ensure that these agreements align with U.S. strategic goals. OAS, PAHO, IICA, and PAIGH have established mechanisms for overseeing their use of funds, such as external auditors, internal audit boards, and anti-fraud and ethics policies. State and USDA have directly supported these mechanisms. For example, State engaged in the selection process for OAS's Inspector General. GAO's review of 12 selected assistance agreements found that USDA included no financial or performance monitoring provisions in one of its agreements and that State did not include two key monitoring provisions in one of its agreements, called for by applicable guidance.

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points. The report is about the rise of e-commerce and its impact on counterfeit goods. \n\nFirst, the main idea is that counterfeit goods are moving from secondary markets (like flea markets) to primary markets, which include e-commerce sites, corporate supply chains, and retail stores. The shift is because counterfeiters are now trying to pass off as authentic, making it harder for consumers to detect. \n\nThe report mentions that in the past, people could tell counterfeits by price, appearance, or where they were sold. But now, counterfeiters use third-party marketplaces to look legitimate, post pictures of real goods, and get fake reviews. Also, they set prices close to genuine goods to trick consumers. \n\nCBP and ICE data shows an increase in counterfeit seizures, especially from China and Hong Kong. The methods of shipment have changed, with express carriers and international mail being the main methods. \n\nThey did some test purchases from e-commerce sites and found that 20 out of 47 items were counterfeit. The counterfeit items had issues like misspellings, incorrect labels, or materials. Also, some had safety issues, like the iPhone adapters that failed and could cause electrocution. \n\nThe report also talks about challenges faced by CBP and ICE, like the sophistication of counterfeits making it hard to distinguish from real ones. Also, the increase in the variety of products being counterfeited. \n\nAdditionally, there's mention of interagency collaboration and information sharing with the private sector. CBP and ICE have some guidance and procedures, but there are limitations on the information shared, which the private sector wants more of. \n\nThe report concludes with recommendations for CBP to evaluate their IPR enforcement efforts and enhance information sharing with the private sector. \n\nNow, I need to condense all this into a one-page summary. Let me structure it with an introduction, key findings, challenges, and recommendations. \n\nIntroduction: Briefly state the purpose of the report, which is to analyze the shift in counterfeit goods markets due to e-commerce growth.\n\nKey Findings: \n- Shift from secondary to primary markets.\n- Counterfeiters use third-party sites, fake reviews, and near-retail prices.\n- Increase in seizures, mostly from China and Hong Kong.\n- Use of", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's January 2018 report, entitled Intellectual Property: Agencies Can Improve Efforts to Address Risks Posed by Changing Counterfeits Market , ( GAO-18-216 ). Changes in the market for counterfeit goods entering the United States pose new challenges for consumers, the private sector, and U.S. agencies that enforce intellectual property rights (IPR). Specifically, growth in e-commerce has contributed to a shift in the sale of counterfeit goods in the United States, with consumers increasingly purchasing goods online and counterfeiters producing a wider variety of goods that may be sold on websites alongside authentic products. For example, 20 of 47 items GAO purchased from third-party sellers on popular consumer websites were counterfeit, according to testing by the products' rights holders (see table), highlighting potential risks to consumers. The changes in the market for counterfeit goods can also pose challenges to the private sector—for example, the challenge of distinguishing counterfeit from authentic goods listed for sale online—and complicate the enforcement efforts of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). CBP and ICE engage in a number of activities to enhance IPR enforcement; however, while ICE has assessed some of its efforts, CBP has taken limited steps to do so. CBP's and ICE's IPR enforcement activities broadly include detecting imports of potentially IPR-infringing goods, conducting special operations at U.S. ports, engaging with international partners, and undertaking localized pilot programs or port-led initiatives. CBP and ICE have collected some performance data for each of the eight activities GAO reviewed, and ICE has taken some steps to understand the impact of its efforts. However, CBP has conducted limited evaluation of its efforts to enhance IPR enforcement. Consequently, CBP may lack information needed to ensure it is investing its resources in the most efficient and effective activities. CBP and ICE generally collaborate on IPR enforcement, but according to private sector representatives, restrictions on CBP's information sharing limit private sector enforcement efforts. GAO found that CBP and ICE have undertaken efforts that align with selected key practices for interagency collaboration, such as participating in developing a national IPR enforcement strategy and agreeing on roles and responsibilities. However, sharing additional information about seized items with rights-holding companies and e-commerce websites could improve enforcement, according to private sector representatives. CBP officials said they share information to the extent allowed under current regulations, but CBP has not completed an assessment of what, if any, additional information would be beneficial to share with private sector entities.

TANF Funding and Expenditures. TANF provides fixed funding for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the territories, and American Indian tribes. The basic block grant totals $16.5 billion per year. States are also required in total to contribute, from their own funds, at least $10.3 billion annually under a maintenance-of-effort (MOE) requirement. Though TANF is best known for funding cash assistance payments for needy families with children, the block grant and MOE funds are used for a wide variety of benefits and activities. In FY2017, expenditures on basic assistance totaled $7.1 billion—23% of total federal TANF and MOE dollars. Basic assistance is often—but not exclusively—paid as cash. In addition to funding basic assistance, TANF also contributes funds for child care and services for children who have been, or are at risk of being, abused and neglected. Some states also count expenditures in prekindergarten programs toward the MOE requirement. The TANF Assistance Caseload. A total of 1.2 million families, composed of 3.1 million recipients, received TANF- or MOE-funded assistance in September 2018. The bulk of the \"recipients\" were children—2.3 million in that month. The assistance caseload is heterogeneous. The type of family once thought of as the \"typical\" assistance family—one with an unemployed adult recipient—accounted for 32% of all families on the rolls in FY2016. Additionally, 31% of cash assistance families had an employed adult, while 38% of all TANF families were \"child-only\" and had no adult recipient. Child-only families include those with disabled adults receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI), adults who are nonparents (e.g., grandparents, aunts, uncles) caring for children, and families consisting of citizen children and ineligible noncitizen parents. Cash Assistance Benefits. TANF cash benefit amounts are set by states. In July 2017, the maximum monthly benefit for a family of three ranged from $1,021 in New Hampshire to $170 in Mississippi. Only New Hampshire (at 60% of the federal poverty guidelines) had a maximum TANF cash assistance amount for this sized family in excess of 50% of poverty-level income. Work Requirements. TANF's main federal work requirement is actually a performance measure that applies to the states. States determine the work rules that apply to individual recipients. TANF law requires states to engage 50% of all families and 90% of two-parent families with work-eligible individuals in work activities, though these standards can be reduced by \"credits.\" Therefore, the effective standards states face are often less than the 50% or 90% targets, and vary by state. In FY2017, states achieved, on average, an all-family participation rate of 53.0% and a two-parent rate of 69.5%. In FY2017, two jurisdictions did not meet the all-family participation standard: Nevada and Guam. This is a reduction from FY2012, when 16 states did not meet that standard. In FY2017, nine jurisdictions did not meet the two-parent standard.

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points. \n\nThe report is about changes in Medicare payment rates for laboratory tests, specifically after the implementation of the Physician, Patient, and Medical Home Advancement Act (PAMA) in 2018. Before PAMA, Medicare used a system with local and national fee schedules, which had different payment rates based on geographic areas and test volumes. The payment rates were based on old data from 1984-1985 adjusted for inflation. There were 57 different fee schedules, which made the payment rates vary. \n\nThen, PAMA introduced a single national fee schedule, based on private-payer rates from 2016. The payment rates were calculated as the median private-payer rates, weighted by test volume. This change affected both individual tests and panel tests. \n\nThe report also discusses the impact of these changes on Medicare expenditures. For example, the new rates were lower than previous ones, but due to the 10% annual reduction limit, Medicare may end up paying more than necessary for some tests. \n\nThere are sections about different types of laboratories, like independent, hospital-outreach, and physician-office labs. The report mentions that the three types that received the most revenue from the CLFS in 2016 were independent, hospital-outreach, and physician-office labs. \n\nThe summary should include the key changes in payment rates, the impact on Medicare spending, the challenges in data collection, and the recommendations made to CMS. \n\nI need to make sure the summary is concise, covers all major points, and is structured logically.

These tests help health care providers prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases. PAMA included a provision for GAO to review CMS's implementation of new payment rates for these tests. This report addresses, among other objectives, (1) how CMS developed the new payment rates; (2) challenges CMS faced in setting accurate payment rates and what factors may have mitigated these challenges; and (3) the potential effect of the new payment rates on Medicare expenditures. GAO analyzed 2016 Medicare claims data (the most recent data available when GAO started its work and the year on which new payment rates were based) and private-payer data CMS collected. GAO also interviewed CMS and industry officials. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) revised the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS) for 2018, establishing new Medicare payment rates for laboratory services. Prior to 2018, these rates were based on historical laboratory fees and were typically higher than the rates paid by private payers. The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA) required CMS to develop a national fee schedule for laboratory tests based on private-payer data. To revise the rates, CMS collected data on private-payer rates from approximately 2,000 laboratories and calculated median payment rates, weighted by volume. GAO found that the median private-payer rates were lower than Medicare's maximum payment rates in 2017 for 88 percent of tests. CMS is gradually phasing in reductions to Medicare payment rates, limited annually at 10 percent over a 3-year period (2018 through 2020), as outlined in PAMA. CMS relied on laboratories to determine whether they met data reporting requirements, but agency officials told GAO that CMS did not receive data from all laboratories required to report. CMS did not estimate the amount of data it should have received from laboratories that were required to report but did not. CMS took steps to exclude inaccurate private-payer data and estimated how collecting certain types and amounts of additional private-payer data could affect Medicare expenditures. However, it is not known whether CMS's estimates reflect the actual risk of incomplete data resulting in inaccurate Medicare payment rates. GAO found that PAMA's phased in reductions to new Medicare payment rates likely mitigated this risk of inaccurate Medicare payment rates from 2018 through 2020. However, GAO found that collecting incomplete data could have a larger effect on the accuracy of Medicare payment rates in future years when PAMA allows for greater payment-rate reductions. CMS's implementation of the new payment rates could lead Medicare to pay billions of dollars more than is necessary and result in CLFS expenditures increasing from what Medicare paid prior to 2018 for two reasons. First, CMS used the maximum Medicare payment rates in 2017 as a baseline to start the phase in of payment-rate reductions instead of using actual Medicare payment rates. This resulted in excess payments for some laboratory tests and, in some cases, higher payment rates than those Medicare previously paid, on average. GAO estimated that Medicare expenditures from 2018 through 2020 may be $733 million more than if CMS had phased in payment-rate reductions based on the average payment rates in 2016. Second, CMS stopped paying a bundled payment rate for certain panel tests (groups of laboratory tests generally performed together), as was its practice prior to 2018, because CMS had not yet clarified its authority to do so under PAMA, according to officials. CMS is currently reviewing whether it has the authority to bundle payment rates for panel tests to reflect the efficiency of conducting a group of tests. GAO estimated that if the payment rate for each panel test were unbundled, Medicare expenditures could increase by as much as $10.3 billion from 2018 through 2020 compared to estimated Medicare expenditures using lower bundled payment rates for panel tests. GAO recommends that the Administrator of CMS (1) collect complete private-payer data from all laboratories required to report or address the estimated effects of incomplete data, (2) phase in payment-rate reductions that start from the actual payment rates rather than the maximum payment rates Medicare paid prior to 2018, and (3) use bundled rates for panel tests. HHS concurred with GAO's first recommendation, neither agreed nor disagreed with the other two, and has since issued guidance to help address the third. GAO believes CMS should fully address these recommendations to prevent Medicare from paying more than is necessary."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6322}

While the nature of lawmakers' interest in bank regulation has shifted over time, most bank regulations fall into one of three general categories. First, banks must abide by a variety of safety-and-soundness requirements designed to minimize the risk of their failure and maintain macroeconomic stability. Second, banks must comply with consumer protection rules intended to deter abusive practices and provide consumers with complete information about financial products and services. Third, banks are subject to various reporting, recordkeeping, and anti-money laundering requirements designed to assist law enforcement in investigating criminal activity. The substantive content of these requirements remains the subject of intense debate. However, the division of regulatory authority over banks between the federal government and the states plays a key role in shaping that content. In some cases, federal law displaces (or \"preempts\") state bank regulations. In other cases, states are permitted to supplement federal regulations with different, sometimes stricter requirements. Because of its substantive implications, federal preemption has recently become a flashpoint in debates surrounding bank regulation. In the American \"dual banking system,\" banks can apply for a national charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) or a state charter from a state's banking authority. A bank's choice of chartering authority is also a choice of primary regulator, as the OCC serves as the primary regulator of national banks and state regulatory agencies serve as the primary regulators of state-chartered banks. However, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) also play an important role in bank regulation. The Federal Reserve supervises all national banks and state-chartered banks that become members of the Federal Reserve System (FRS), while the FDIC supervises all state banks that do not become members of the FRS. This complex regulatory architecture has resulted in a \"symbiotic system\" with both federal regulation of state banks and state regulation of national banks. In the modern dual banking system, national banks are often subject to generally applicable state laws, and state banks are subject to both generally applicable federal laws and regulations imposed by their federal regulators. The evolution of this system during the 20th century caused the regulation of national banks and state banks to converge in a number of important ways. However, despite this convergence, federal preemption provides national banks with certain unique advantages. In Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson, the Supreme Court held that the National Bank Act (NBA) preempts state laws that \"significantly interfere\" with the powers of national banks. The Court has also issued two decisions on the preemptive scope of a provision of the NBA limiting states' \"visitorial powers\" over national banks. Finally, OCC rules have taken a broad view of the preemptive effects of the NBA, limiting the ways in which states can regulate national banks. Courts, regulators, and legislators have recently confronted a number of issues involving banking preemption and related federalism questions. Specifically, Congress has considered legislation that would overturn a line of judicial decisions concerning the circumstances in which non-banks can benefit from federal preemption of state usury laws. The OCC has also announced its intention to grant national bank charters to certain financial technology (FinTech) companies—a decision that is currently being litigated. Finally, Congress has recently turned its attention to the banking industry's response to state efforts to legalize and regulate marijuana."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8713}

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report is for Congress, discussing the TAO-205 program. The Navy wants to build 20 fleet oilers. The FY2020 budget requests the fifth and sixth ships. Congress has to decide on funding, number of oilers needed, and whether to add more self-defense equipment.\n\nFirst, the purpose of the report is to provide background and issues for Congress regarding the TAO-205 program. The main points are about funding, number of ships, and self-defense equipment.\n\nThe report explains that fleet oilers are crucial for extending the operating endurance of surface ships and their embarked aircraft. They perform underway replenishments (UNREPs) by transferring fuel via hose. The current fleet oilers are the 15 Kaiser-class ships, built between 1982-1989, with service life of 35 years. The first of these will reach 35 years in 2021. These ships are being replaced by the TAO-205 class.\n\nThe Navy's FY2020 budget requests the procurement of the fifth and sixth ships. The procurement cost for these two ships is $1,056.3 million, or $528.1 million each. They have received $75 million in prior funding, and the budget requests the remaining $981.2 million.\n\nCongress has three main issues to consider: approving, rejecting, or modifying the funding request; determining the number of oilers needed in the future; and whether to add more self-defense equipment.\n\nThe first issue is about the FY2020 funding. The Navy's estimate is that the cost is $1,056.3 million. The report mentions that the Navy has used advance procurement funding to order parts in bulk, which could have been done under annual contracting. The savings from the block buy contract is about $10 million per ship.\n\nThe second issue is the number of oilers needed. The Navy is implementing a new operational concept called Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO), which could lead to a larger number of smaller ships and more dispersed operations. This could affect the logistics requirements, including the number of oilers.

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points. The report is about the three service classifications in the federal government: competitive service, excepted service, and Senior Executive Service (SES). \n\nFirst, the competitive service is the largest part, with over two million workers. They are evaluated based on objective standards. The excepted service and SES are different. The excepted service includes positions not in the competitive service, and SES is for high-level managerial roles. \n\nThe report explains the differences between these services. For competitive service, there are exams administered by OPM, and the pay is based on the General Schedule (GS). There are different types of appointments: continuing, term, and temporary. Also, there are rights for notice and appeal for adverse actions. \n\nThen the excepted service has four schedules (A, B, C, D). Each has different qualifications and requirements. For example, Schedule A includes positions like chaplains and short-term positions. Schedule B requires meeting basic qualification standards. Schedule C is for political appointees. Schedule D includes STEM positions. \n\nThe SES is a separate entity with its own pay structure and performance appraisals. They have different pay rates and some special removal procedures, especially for the VA. \n\nI need to condense all this into one page. Let me structure it.

Then the SES, its structure, pay, performance appraisals, and removal processes. \n\nAlso, note the numbers: over 2 million in competitive service, about 7,000 SES positions. The excepted service has about one-third of all federal workers. \n\nI should mention the General Schedule, the four schedules, the SES with its two types of positions (career reserved and general), and the performance appraisal systems. \n\nMake sure to highlight the key differences between the services, like the competitive service being based on exams, excepted service not requiring exams, SES having different pay scales and performance-based appraisals. \n\nAlso, the part about the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) for appeals", "answers": ["According to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the federal workforce consists of an estimated two million civilian employees. Federal law categorizes these employees into three types of service—the competitive service, the excepted service, and the Senior Executive Service (SES)—that may be distinguished by different selection, compensation, and other standards. Title 5 of the U.S. Code (Title 5) contains most of the standards governing federal employment, and OPM is generally responsible for implementing these requirements. The competitive service largely consists of all civil service positions in the executive branch, other than (1) positions excepted from the competitive service by statute; (2) positions appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate; and (3) the SES. Traditionally, OPM has administered examinations for entrance into the competitive service. These examinations are meant to be \"practical in character\" and relate to \"matters that fairly test the relative capacity and fitness of the applicants for the appointment sought.\" Title 5 also authorizes OPM to prescribe rules allowing agencies to hire candidates directly under specified circumstances. The excepted service includes designated civil service positions that are not in the competitive service or the SES and are not subject to competitive examination. OPM maintains authority to exempt a position from the competitive service when it determines that an appointment through competitive examination is not practicable, or the recruitment of students or recent graduates would be better achieved through alternate recruitment and assessment processes. The pay structure for the competitive service and the excepted service is similar. Both services are typically paid in accordance with the General Schedule, a schedule of annual basic pay rates that consists of 15 grades, designated \"GS-1\" through \"GS-15.\" This fixed pay scale is generally designed to reflect, among other things, equal pay for substantially equal work within a local pay area. Additionally, the competitive service and the excepted service generally have similar notice and appeal rights for adverse personnel actions. For example, before a removal, a suspension for more than 14 days, a reduction in grade or pay, or a furlough of 30 days or less, the agency must provide at least 30 days' advance written notice to the affected employee. The employee must also be given a reasonable time to respond to the notice and provide affidavits and other evidence to support the answer. Some adverse actions may also be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB or Board), an independent, quasi-judicial agency that reviews and adjudicates specified personnel actions taken against qualifying federal employees. The SES is a corps of some 7,000 high-level government administrators who manage major programs and projects within most federal agencies. In these leadership roles, SES members may serve as a link between top-level political appointees of an agency and career civil servants within the agency. The SES is governed by a regulatory structure separate from the competitive and excepted services. While SES members are primarily career appointees chosen through a merit-based competitive hiring process, others are noncareer, limited term or limited emergency appointees (commonly political appointees) selected by agency leadership. To shield certain SES roles from political influence, some SES positions (career reserved positions) must be filled with career appointees, and Title 5 limits the number of noncareer and limited term appointees that may serve in SES positions. The SES pay structure is distinct from the rest of the civil service. Title 5 specifies that SES members are paid within a particular range based on an executive's individual performance or contribution to agency performance (or both), as measured under a performance appraisal system. In addition, Title 5 articulates special conditions and procedures for removing, suspending, or taking other adverse actions against a member of the SES. For example, career SES appointees who have successfully completed a one-year probationary period may be removed or subject to adverse action only for specified reasons, including misconduct and substandard performance. Career appointees must receive advance written notice of these actions, and an opportunity to appeal the action. In comparison, noncareer, limited term, and limited emergency appointees are generally not subject to the same protections and may be removed from the SES at any time."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2697}

U.S. Navy Admiral Philip Davidson, in his responses to advance policy questions from the Senate Armed Services Committee for an April 17, 2018, hearing to consider his nomination to become Commander, U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM), stated that \"China is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in all scenarios short of war with the United States.\" Chinese control of the SCS—and, more generally, Chinese domination of China's near-seas region, meaning the SCS, the East China Sea (ECS), and the Yellow Sea—could substantially affect U.S. strategic, political, and economic interests in the Indo-Pacific region and elsewhere. China is a party to multiple territorial disputes in the SCS and ECS, including, in particular, disputes with multiple neighboring countries over the Paracel Islands, Spratly Islands, and Scarborough Shoal in the SCS, and with Japan over the Senkaku Islands in the ECS. Up through 2014, U.S. concern over these disputes centered more on their potential for causing tension, incidents, and a risk of conflict between China and its neighbors in the region, including U.S. allies Japan and the Philippines and emerging partner states such as Vietnam. While that concern remains, particularly regarding the potential for a conflict between China and Japan involving the Senkaku Islands, U.S. concern since 2014 (i.e., since China's island-building activities in the Spratly Islands were first publicly reported) has shifted increasingly to how China's strengthening position in the SCS may be affecting the risk of a U.S.-China crisis or conflict in the SCS and the broader U.S.-Chinese strategic competition. In addition to territorial disputes in the SCS and ECS, China is involved in a dispute, particularly with the United States, over whether China has a right under international law to regulate the activities of foreign military forces operating within China's exclusive economic zone (EEZ). The position of the United States and most other countries is that while international law gives coastal states the right to regulate economic activities (such as fishing and oil exploration) within their EEZs, it does not give coastal states the right to regulate foreign military activities in the parts of their EEZs beyond their 12-nautical-mile territorial waters. The position of China and some other countries (i.e., a minority group among the world's nations) is that UNCLOS gives coastal states the right to regulate not only economic activities, but also foreign military activities, in their EEZs. The dispute appears to be at the heart of multiple incidents between Chinese and U.S. ships and aircraft in international waters and airspace since 2001, and has potential implications not only for China's EEZs, but for U.S. naval operations in EEZs globally, and for international law of the sea. A key issue for Congress is how the United States should respond to China's actions in the SCS and ECS—particularly its island-building and base-construction activities in the Spratly Islands—and to China's strengthening position in the SCS. A key oversight question for Congress is whether the Trump Administration has an appropriate strategy—and an appropriate amount of resources for implementing that strategy—for countering China's \"salami-slicing\" strategy or gray zone operations for gradually strengthening its position in the SCS, for imposing costs on China for its actions in the SCS and ECS, and for defending and promoting U.S. interests in the region."], "all_classes": null, "length": 40508}
{"pred": " The report provides an in-depth analysis of the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) laboratory enterprise, highlighting its structure, funding models, and the legislative authorities available to foster innovation and efficiency. The DOD operates 63 laboratories, warfare centers, and engineering centers across the Army, Navy, and Air Force, employing approximately 50,000 federally contracted scientists and engineers. These labs are managed within the military service chain of command, and their funding comes from various sources, including appropriated funds, customer funding, and the Navy Working Capital Fund.\n\nThe report outlines the different funding models for each service. The Army and Air Force labs typically rely on mission funding or customer funding, while the Navy operates under the Navy Working Capital Fund, which is a revolving fund that finances Department of the Navy activities on a reimbursable basis. The Navy also uses a Capital Investment Program to obtain capital assets, including minor military construction projects for labs. This program provides the framework for planning, coordinating, and controlling Navy working capital funds and expenditures to obtain capital assets.\n\nIn addition to its own labs, the DOD sponsors Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) and University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs) to provide scientific expertise in emerging technical areas. These centers are governed through non-competitive agreements, such as contracts, and provide access to experts employed by universities and other non-profit organizations. The Lincoln Laboratory and the Software Engineering Institute are examples of such sponsored centers.\n\nThe report also discusses the Laboratory Initiated Research Authority, which allows lab directors to fund projects in four categories: basic and applied research, technology transition, workforce development, and revitalization, recapitalization, or repair or minor construction of lab infrastructure. However, the use of this authority has been limited by various factors, including DOD legal and policy restrictions, stakeholder concerns, and service-specific obstacles.\n\nThe report highlights that while most defense labs have used the Laboratory Initiated Research Authority, they have not fully utilized the full 4 percent of all funds available to the lab, or charged customers a fixed percentage fee of costs, as allowed by law. For example, Navy labs reported charging customers a percentage fee of about 2 percent of costs as of fiscal year 2018, up from 1 percent prior to that. Army labs reported using between 2 and 3 percent of all funds available to the lab for projects under the four allowable categories and charging customers a fixed fee of between zero and 3 percent of costs to fund", "answers": ["Congress created several authorities that provide DOD research labs with ways to increase efficiency and foster innovation. Senate report 114-255 contained a provision for GAO to study governance models used by federal labs. This report evaluates DOD labs' use of authorities to foster innovation and efficiency. GAO selected four authorities that recent work on best practices for science and technology management and expedited defense lab hiring have shown to be the most crucial for supporting innovation; administered a survey to 44 lab directors to gain insight into their use of the authorities; interviewed key lab officials and contractors; and reviewed relevant policies and guidance. Congress has provided the Department of Defense's (DOD) research labs with several authorities to enhance management and operations. Four authorities that GAO examined provide lab directors with greater ability to make their own decisions regarding the funding of projects, hiring, lab management, and purchasing of equipment or services. 1. Laboratory initiated research authority. This authority, as implemented, provides labs with a means to fund new science and technology projects that they consider a priority. Labs may use a percentage of all funds available to the lab and are permitted to charge customers of the lab a percentage fee of the costs for activities performed by the lab for the customer. 2. Direct hire authority. This authority enables labs to compete with private industry for high-quality talent. For example, it provides for streamlined hiring of applicants with relevant advanced degrees, or students enrolled in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics programs. 3. Laboratory enhancement pilot program authority. This authority generally allows lab directors to propose alternative methods that might lead to more effective lab management, and waive certain policies or procedures that might affect implementation of these methods. 4. Micro-purchase authority. This authority raises the threshold for small purchases for DOD research lab activities from $3,500 to $10,000 to facilitate acquisitions. While labs have used these authorities, their use has sometimes been limited, particularly with the laboratory initiated research authority. DOD lab directors at Air Force, Navy, and Army cited several obstacles that impede wider use of that authority, specifically: Air Force: Financial management officials at the Air Force stated that the service's accounting system does not currently have an automated capability to transfer the allowable percentage fee of costs to a central account at the Air Force Research Laboratory. This lack of capability, officials noted, creates a significant administrative burden related to charging these fees. Navy: In fiscal year 2017, Navy labs invested $7.3 million in lab infrastructure projects, compared to $32.9 million and $53.7 million at the Air Force and Army, respectively. Navy lab officials told us that they were restricted in their use of infrastructure funds available under the laboratory initiated research authority due to a lack of clear guidance as to whether and how to use this authority within the Capital Investment Program of the Navy Working Capital Fund. Army: The Army requires its labs to use a similar percentage of funds from two sources: (1) what it refers to as directly appropriated funds and (2) funds labs charge for customer activities. Some Army lab directors reported assessing a lower rate on customer funds than allowed so as not to drive customers away. The labs then generally charge a lower than desired rate on their directly appropriated funds, which further constrains the total funding available to them. GAO is making three recommendations to enhance DOD's use of laboratory initiated research authority, including that the Air Force assess potential accounting system improvements, the Navy clarify how labs can use the authority for infrastructure improvements, and the Army assess its policy to determine whether changes are needed to remove disincentives for labs to use the authority.

It mentions that many programs are available after a major disaster declaration by the President under the Stafford Act, but some aid is available under emergency declarations or on an as-needed basis. The report then lists several specific programs, like the Individuals and Households Program (IHP), Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA), Dislocated Worker Program, SBA Disaster Loans, Disaster Legal Services (DLS), Disaster Case Management (DCM), and others. Each program has its own criteria, eligibility, and funding sources.\n\nThe summary needs to be concise, so I should highlight the main programs, their purposes, and how they are funded. Also, the report mentions that these programs are often used for financial assistance in disaster response and recovery. It's important to note that the list isn't exhaustive, as unique circumstances can lead to unique forms of assistance. Congress may authorize specific forms of assistance on a limited basis following particular disasters.\n\nI should mention the primary vehicle for FEMA assistance, which is the IHP, and its limitations. Also, the Disaster Legal Services and other general assistance programs that can be used in disaster situations.

The CMS-64 form captures various expenditure types for Medicaid, including services, populations, and matching rates. States report aggregate expenditures, not linked to individual services. Variations in reporting exist based on state Medicaid features, such as reporting expenditures for expansion enrollees and populations with different matching rates. CMS is responsible for ensuring that expenditures are allowable, meaning the state actually made and recorded the expenditure and that the expenditure is consistent with Medicaid requirements. Regional offices perform ongoing oversight, with enhanced oversight procedures in the 20 states with the highest federal Medicaid expenditures. CMS reviews expenditures reported by states each quarter. Regional office reviewers have 50 days to review expenditures and compute the federal share of states’ Medicaid expenditures. As part of the quarterly review, regional office reviewers also check that expenditures receive the correct matching rate. The Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) determines the federal matching rate for each state annually. However, there are exceptions where higher matching rates apply for certain types of beneficiaries, services, or administrative costs. The report highlights weaknesses in CMS's oversight of state expenditures. The report also discusses the financial impact of CMS's expenditure reviews, which have saved over $5 billion in federal funds since fiscal year 2014. The report concludes with three recommendations for CMS to improve its financial oversight of state expenditures. The first recommendation is for CMS to conduct a comprehensive, national risk assessment to ensure that resources are adequate and allocated based on risk. The second recommendation is for CMS to clarify internal guidance on when a variance analysis is required for higher matched expenditures. The third recommendation is for CMS to revise the sampling methodology for reviewing expenditures for the Medicaid expansion population to better target high risk areas. The report was prepared for the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The report was reviewed by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and HHS concurred with all three recommendations. The report was prepared for the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) by the Government", "answers": ["Medicaid has grown by over 50 percent over the last decade, with about $370 billion in federal spending in fiscal year 2017. CMS is responsible for assuring that expenditures—reported quarterly by states—are consistent with Medicaid requirements and matched with the correct amount of federal funds. CMS's review of reported expenditures has become increasingly complex due to variation in states' Medicaid programs and an increasing number of different matching rates. GAO was asked to examine CMS's oversight of state-reported Medicaid expenditures. In this report, GAO examined how CMS assures that (1) expenditures are supported and consistent with requirements; and (2) the correct federal matching rates were applied to expenditures subject to a higher match. GAO also examined the financial impact of resolved errors. GAO reviewed documentation for the most recently completed quarterly reviews by 3 of CMS's 10 regional offices for six states that varied by Medicaid program expenditures and design. GAO also reviewed policies, procedures, and data on resolved errors; and interviewed CMS and state officials. GAO assessed CMS's oversight processes against federal standards for internal control. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which oversees Medicaid, has various review processes in place to assure that expenditures reported by states are supported and consistent with Medicaid requirements. The agency also has processes to review that the correct federal matching rates were applied to expenditures receiving a higher than standard federal matching rate, which can include certain types of services and populations. These processes collectively have had a considerable federal financial benefit, with CMS resolving errors that reduced federal spending by over $5.1 billion in fiscal years 2014 through 2017. However, GAO identified weaknesses in how CMS targets its resources to address risks when reviewing whether expenditures are supported and consistent with requirements. CMS devotes similar levels of staff resources to review expenditures despite differing levels of risk across states. For example, the number of staff reviewing California's expenditures—which represent 15 percent of federal Medicaid spending—is similar to the number reviewing Arkansas' expenditures, which represents 1 percent of federal Medicaid spending. CMS cancelled in-depth financial management reviews in 17 out of 51 instances over the last 5 years. These reviews target expenditures considered by CMS to be at risk of not meeting program requirements. CMS told GAO that resource constraints contributed to both weaknesses. However, the agency has not completed a comprehensive assessment of risk to (1) determine whether oversight resources are adequate and (2) focus on the most significant areas of risk. Absent such an assessment, CMS is missing an opportunity to identify errors in reported expenditures that could result in substantial savings to the Medicaid program. GAO also found limitations in CMS's processes for reviewing expenditures that receive a higher federal matching rate. Internal guidance for examining variances in these expenditures was unclear, and not all reviewers in the three CMS regional offices GAO reviewed were investigating significant variances in quarter-to-quarter expenditures. Review procedures for expenditures for individuals newly eligible for Medicaid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act were not tailored to different risk levels among states. For example, in its reviews of a sample of claims for this population, CMS reviewed claims for the same number of enrollees—30—in California as for Arkansas, even though California had 10 times the number of newly eligible enrollees as Arkansas. Without clear internal guidance and better targeting of risks in its review procedures for expenditures receiving higher matching rates, CMS may overpay states. GAO is making three recommendations, including that CMS improve its risk-based targeting of oversight efforts and resources, and clarify related internal guidance. The Department of Health and Human Services concurred with these recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5872}
{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12 pt font, 1 inch margins, no markdown)\nSince 1952, the Egyptian military has been a central force in the country's governance, producing four presidents: Gamal Abdel Nasser (1954-1970), Anwar Sadat (1970-1981), Hosni Mubarak (1981-2011), and Abdel Fattah el Sisi (2013-present). This military-backed rule has been marked by a strong presence of the security establishment, with the notable exception of the Muslim Brotherhood, which has consistently opposed this model of governance, advocating for a state governed by a combination of civil and Shariah law. The Arab Spring, which began in Tunisia, led to the oust of Hosni Mubarak in February 2011, and during the subsequent period, Egypt experienced significant political upheaval, including the one-year presidency of the Muslim Brotherhood's Muhammad Morsi. Morsi's presidency, which began in June 2012, was intended to conclude a rocky 16-month transition period. However, the presidency exposed deep divisions in Egyptian politics, pitting various sectors, the Coptic Church, and the military against the Brotherhood and its supporters. The atmosphere of mutual distrust, political gridlock, and public dissatisfaction that permeated Morsi's presidency provided Egypt's military, led by then-Defense Minister Sisi, with an opportunity to reassert political control. On July 3, 2013, following several days of mass demonstrations against Morsi's rule, the military unilaterally dissolved Morsi's government, suspended the constitution that had been passed during his rule, and installed an interim president. The Muslim Brotherhood and its supporters declared the military's actions a coup d'état and protested in the streets. Weeks later, Egypt's military and national police launched a violent crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood, resulting in police and army soldiers firing live ammunition against demonstrators encamped in several public squares and the killing of at least 1,150 demonstrators. The Egyptian military justified these actions by decrying the encampments as a threat to national security. Following this, President Sisi has consolidated his power, with the support of the security establishment, while the economy has been growing steadily. Despite this, the public continues to face high inflation and economic inequality. Egypt's political landscape has been shaped by a cycle of military rule,", "answers": ["Historically, Egypt has been an important country for U.S. national security interests based on its geography, demography, and diplomatic posture. Egypt controls the Suez Canal, which is one of the world's most well-known maritime chokepoints, linking the Mediterranean and Red Seas. Egypt, with its population of more than 100 million people, is by far the most populous Arabic-speaking country. Although it may not play the same type of leading political or military role in the Arab world as it has in the past, Egypt may retain some \"soft power\" by virtue of its history, media, and culture. Cairo plays host both to the 22-member Arab League and Al Azhar University, which claims to be the oldest continuously operating university in the world and has symbolic importance as a leading source of Islamic scholarship. Additionally, Egypt's 1979 peace treaty with Israel remains one of the most significant diplomatic achievements for the promotion of Arab-Israeli peace. While people-to-people relations remain cold, the Israeli and Egyptian governments have increased their cooperation against Islamist militants and instability in the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip. Personnel moves and possible amendments to the Egyptian constitution highlight apparent efforts by President Sisi to consolidate power with the help of political allies, including colleagues from Egypt's security establishment. President Sisi has come under repeated international criticism for an ongoing government crackdown against various forms of political dissent and freedom of expression. The Egyptian government has defended its human rights record, asserting that the country is under pressure from terrorist groups seeking to destabilize Arab nation-states. The Trump Administration has tried to normalize ties with the Sisi government that were generally perceived as strained under President Obama. In January 2019, U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo delivered a major policy speech at the American University in Cairo, where he stated, \"And as we seek an even stronger partnership with Egypt, we encourage President Sisi to unleash the creative energy of Egypt's people, unfetter the economy, and promote a free and open exchange of ideas.\" The United States has provided significant military and economic assistance to Egypt since the late 1970s. Successive U.S. Administrations have justified aid to Egypt as an investment in regional stability, built primarily on long-running cooperation with the Egyptian military and on sustaining the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. All U.S. foreign aid to Egypt (or any recipient) is appropriated and authorized by Congress. Since 1946, the United States has provided Egypt with over $83 billion in bilateral foreign aid (calculated in historical dollars—not adjusted for inflation). Annual appropriations legislation includes several conditions governing the release of these funds. All U.S. military aid to Egypt finances the procurement of weapons systems and services from U.S. defense contractors. For FY2019, Congress has appropriated $1.4 billion in total bilateral assistance for Egypt, the same amount it provided in FY2018. For FY2020, the President is requesting a total of $1.382 billion in bilateral assistance for Egypt. Nearly all of the U.S. funds for Egypt come from the FMF account (military aid). In November 2018, the U.S. Defense Department notified Congress of a major $1 billion sale of defense equipment to Egypt, consisting of 10 AH-64E Apache Attack Helicopters, among other things. Beyond the United States, President Sisi has broadened Egypt's international base of support to include several key partners, including the Arab Gulf states, Israel, Russia, and France.

The benefits include cost savings, faster deployment, increased deterrence, and resilience. However, there are challenges like matching size, weight, power, and spectrum needs. \n\nThe DOD has used commercial satellites for experimental payloads, saving hundreds of millions of dollars. The Hosted Payload Office (HPO) was established in 2011 to streamline these arrangements. They have a contract called HOPS, which is a multiple award IDIQ vehicle. The HPO is working on a secure data interface unit to protect data from unauthorized access. \n\nThe report mentions that the HPO is developing tools to address the challenges. However, DOD has limited data and fragmented knowledge on hosted payloads. This fragmentation leads to resistance in adopting this approach. \n\nThe report also talks about the Hosted Payload Solutions Contract (HOPS) which is a contract that allows government agencies to access commercial satellites. The HPO is developing a secure data interface unit to protect data from unauthorized access. \n\nThe challenges include technical issues like matching size, weight, power, and spectrum needs, aligning government and commercial timelines, and addressing cybersecurity concerns. \n\nThe report concludes with recommendations, suggesting that the Secretary of Defense should require programs using hosted payloads to provide cost and technical data, and lessons learned to a central office. \n\nNow, I need to condense all this into a one-page summary.

For such satellite systems, a single adversary attack or on-orbit failure can result in the loss of billions of dollars of investment and significant loss of vital capabilities. As DOD plans new space systems and addresses an increasingly contested space environment, it has the opportunity to consider different acquisition approaches. One such approach is to integrate a government sensor or payload onto a commercial host satellite. House Armed Services Committee report 115-200, accompanying a bill for the Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, included a provision for GAO to review DOD's use of commercially hosted payloads. This report (1) determines the extent to which DOD uses commercially hosted payloads and (2) describes and assesses factors that affect their use. GAO reviewed DOD policies, documentation, and planning documents, and interviewed a wide range of DOD and civil government officials, and commercial stakeholders. GAO and others have found that using commercial satellites to host government sensors or communications packages—called payloads—may be one way DOD can achieve on-orbit capability faster and more affordably. Using hosted payloads may also help facilitate a proliferation of payloads on orbit, making it more difficult for an adversary to defeat a capability. Since 2009, DOD has used three commercially hosted payloads, with three more missions planned or underway through 2022 (see figure below). DOD estimates that it has achieved cost savings of several hundred million dollars from using commercially hosted payloads to date, and expects to realize additional savings and deliver faster capabilities on orbit from planned missions. Cost savings can result from sharing development, launch, and ground system costs with the commercial host company. Among the factors that affect DOD's use of hosted payloads are a perception among some DOD officials that matching government payloads to commercial satellites is too difficult; and limited, fragmented knowledge on how to mitigate various challenges GAO found that further opportunities to use hosted payloads may emerge as DOD plans new and follow-on space systems in the coming years. However, DOD's knowledge on using hosted payloads is fragmented, in part because programs are not required to share information. In 2011, the Air Force created a Hosted Payload Office to provide expertise and other tools to facilitate matching government payloads with commercial hosts. However, GAO found that DOD programs using hosted payloads are not required and generally do not provide cost and technical data, or lessons learned, to the Hosted Payload Office, or another central office for analysis. Requiring programs that use hosted payloads agency-wide to provide this information to a central location would better position DOD to make informed decisions when considering acquisition approaches for upcoming space system designs. GAO recommends that DOD require programs using commercially hosted payloads to contribute resulting data to a central location. In implementing this recommendation, DOD should assess whether the Air Force's Hosted Payload Office is the appropriate location to collect and analyze the data.

GAO was asked to review workforce trends in the technology sector and federal oversight. This report examines (1) trends in the gender, racial, and ethnic composition of the technology sector workforce; and (2) EEOC and OFCCP oversight of technology companies' compliance with equal employment and affirmative action requirements. GAO analyzed workforce data from the American Community Survey for 2005-2015 and EEOC Employer Information Reports for 2007-2015, the latest data available during our analysis. GAO analyzed OFCCP data on compliance evaluations for fiscal years 2011-2016. GAO interviewed agency officials, researchers, and workforce, industry, and company representatives. The estimated percentage of minority technology workers increased from 2005 to 2015, but GAO found that no growth occurred for female and Black workers, whereas Asian and Hispanic workers made statistically significant increases (see figure). Further, female, Black, and Hispanic workers remain a smaller proportion of the technology workforce—mathematics, computing, and engineering occupations—compared to their representation in the general workforce. These groups have also been less represented among technology workers inside the technology sector than outside it. In contrast, Asian workers were more represented in these occupations than in the general workforce. Stakeholders and researchers GAO interviewed identified several factors that may have contributed to the lower representation of certain groups, such as fewer women and minorities graduating with technical degrees and company hiring and retention practices. Both the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) have taken steps to enforce equal employment and affirmative action requirements in the technology sector, but face limitations. While EEOC has identified barriers to recruitment and hiring in the technology sector as a strategic priority, when EEOC conducts investigations, it does not systematically record the type of industry, therefore limiting sector-related analyses to help focus its efforts. EEOC has plans to determine how to add missing industry codes but has not set a timeframe to do this. In addition, OFCCP's regulations may hinder its ability to enforce contractors' compliance because OFCCP directs contractors to set placement goals for all minorities as a group rather than for specific racial/ethnic groups. OFCCP also has not made changes to its establishment-based approach to selecting entities for review in decades, even though changes have occurred in how workplaces are structured. Without taking steps to address these issues, OFCCP may miss opportunities to hold contractors responsible for complying with affirmative action and nondiscrimination requirements. GAO makes 6 recommendations, including that EEOC develop a timeline to improve industry data collection and OFCCP take steps toward requiring more specific minority placement goals by contractors and assess key aspects of its selection approach.

This report (1) examines the extent to which the VA's pilot design aligns with leading practices and (2) discusses what VA has learned from the pilot to date. GAO reviewed VA documents, including plans for the pilot program, and visited the Omaha pilot project. GAO interviewed VA officials, the Omaha donor group, and three non-federal entities that responded to VA's request seeking donors. GAO compared implementation of VA's pilot to leading practices for pilot design, organizational transformation, and cross-functional teams. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is conducting a pilot program, called CHIP-IN, that allows VA to partner with non-federal entities and accept real property donations from them as a way to help address VA's infrastructure needs. Although VA signed its first project agreement under the program in April 2017, VA has not yet established a framework for effective design of the pilot program. Specifically, VA's pilot program design is not aligned with four of five leading practices for designing a well-developed and documented pilot program. VA has begun to implement one leading practice by improving its efforts to communicate with relevant stakeholders, such as including external stakeholders in key meetings. However, the VA offices involved have not agreed upon and documented clear, measurable objectives for the pilot program, which is a leading practice. Further, VA has not developed an assessment methodology or an evaluation plan that would help inform decisions about whether or how the pilot approach could be expanded. While VA officials said they intend to develop these items as tasks for the newly formed CHIP-IN steering committee, they have no timeline for doing so. Without clear objectives and assessment and evaluation plans, VA and Congress may have difficulty determining whether the pilot approach is an effective way to help address VA's infrastructure needs. To date, the CHIP-IN pilot suggests that donation partnerships could improve construction projects, but identifying donors and establishing a team for the pilot program have presented challenges. Officials from VA and the donor group for the first pilot project—an ambulatory care center in Omaha, Nebraska—said they are completing the project faster than if it had been a standard federal construction project, while achieving potential cost savings by using private sector practices. However, VA officials said it is challenging to find partners to make large donations with no financial return, and VA's lack of marketing and philanthropic development experience exacerbates that challenge. VA and the donor group agreed that a dedicated team of individuals with relevant expertise could facilitate the pilot's implementation. The new CHIP-IN steering committee could serve this purpose, but it lacks documented roles and responsibilities. Establishing a team with clear roles and responsibilities and identifying both available and needed staff resources could assist VA in partnering with additional donors and creating new opportunities to meet veterans' needs.

HUD has primary responsibility for lead paint hazards in rental assistance programs, while the EPA sets federal standards for lead in paint, soil, and dust. The CDC establishes the blood lead reference value, which is currently set at 5 micrograms per deciliter of blood, identifying children with elevated lead levels. HUD's Lead Safe Housing Rule mandates procedures for identifying and addressing lead paint hazards, including actions if a child's blood test shows elevated levels. The report highlights HUD's efforts to ensure housing is lead-safe through its lead grant programs, which provide funding for lead hazard control activities. It also discusses HUD's oversight of lead paint regulations for its voucher and public housing programs. The report identifies areas where HUD could improve the effectiveness of its efforts to identify and address lead paint hazards and protect children in low-income housing from lifelong health problems. These areas include documenting and evaluating grant processes, identifying areas at risk for lead hazards, overseeing compliance with lead paint regulations, and amending the inspection standard in the voucher program. The report also includes nine recommendations to HUD to address these areas for improvement.

HUD awards grants to state and local governments to reduce lead paint hazards in housing and oversees compliance with lead paint regulations in its rental assistance programs. The 2017 Consolidated Appropriations Act, Joint Explanatory Statement, includes a provision that GAO review HUD’s efforts to address lead paint hazards. This report examines HUD’s efforts to (1) incorporate statutory requirements and other relevant federal standards in its lead grant programs, (2) monitor and enforce compliance with lead paint regulations in its rental assistance programs, (3) adopt federal health guidelines and environmental standards for its lead grant and rental assistance programs, and (4) measure and report on the performance of its lead efforts. GAO reviewed HUD documents and data related to its grant programs, compliance efforts, performance measures, and reporting. GAO also interviewed HUD staff and some grantees. The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) lead grant and rental assistance programs have taken steps to address lead paint hazards, but opportunities exist for improvement. For example, in 2016, HUD began using new tools to monitor how public housing agencies comply with lead paint regulations. However, HUD could further improve efforts in the following areas: Lead grant programs. While its recent grant award processes incorporate statutory requirements on applicant eligibility and selection criteria, HUD has not fully documented or evaluated these processes. For example, HUD’s guidance is not sufficiently detailed to ensure consistent and appropriate grant award decisions. Better documentation and evaluation of HUD’s grant program processes could help ensure that lead grants reach areas at risk of lead paint hazards. Further, HUD has not developed specific time frames for using available local-level data to better identify areas of the country at risk for lead paint hazards, which could help HUD target its limited resources. Oversight. HUD does not have a plan to mitigate and address risks related to noncompliance with lead paint regulations by public housing agencies. We identified several limitations with HUD’s monitoring efforts, including reliance on public housing agencies’ self-certifying compliance with lead paint regulations and challenges identifying children with elevated blood lead levels. Additionally, HUD lacks detailed procedures for addressing noncompliance consistently and in a timely manner. Developing a plan and detailed procedures to address noncompliance with lead paint regulations could strengthen HUD’s oversight of public housing agencies. Inspections. The lead inspection standard for the Housing Choice Voucher program is less strict than that of the public housing program. By requesting and obtaining statutory authority to amend the standard for the voucher program, HUD would be positioned to take steps to better protect children in voucher units from lead exposure as indicated by analysis of benefits and costs. Performance assessment and reporting. HUD lacks comprehensive goals and performance measures for its lead reduction efforts. In addition, it has not complied with annual statutory reporting requirements, last reporting as required on its lead efforts in 1997. Without better performance assessment and reporting, HUD cannot fully assess the effectiveness of its lead efforts. GAO makes nine recommendations to HUD including to improve lead grant program and compliance monitoring processes, request authority to amend its lead inspection standard in the voucher program, and take additional steps to report on progress. HUD generally agreed with eight of the recommendations. HUD disagreed that it should request authority to use a specific, stricter inspection standard. GAO revised this recommendation to allow HUD greater flexibility to amend its current inspection standard as indicated by analysis of the benefits and costs."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12091}
{"pred": " The Government Performance and Results Act of 2010 (GPRAMA) is a legislative framework designed to enhance government accountability and performance. It was enacted to address persistent challenges in the federal government, such as fragmented efforts and the need for better performance data.

GPRAMA includes a provision for GAO to review the act's implementation. This report assesses how GPRAMA implementation has affected the federal government's progress in resolving key governance challenges in (1) addressing cross-cutting issues, (2) ensuring performance information is useful and used, (3) aligning daily operations with results, and (4) building a more transparent and open government. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed statutory requirements, OMB guidance, and GAO's recent work related to GPRAMA implementation and the key governance challenges. GAO also interviewed OMB staff and surveyed a stratified random sample of 4,395 federal managers from 24 agencies on various performance and management topics. With a 67 percent response rate, the survey results are generalizable to the government-wide population of managers. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and agencies have made some progress in more fully implementing the GPRA Modernization Act (GPRAMA), but GAO's work and 2017 survey of federal managers highlight numerous areas where improvements are needed. Cross-cutting issues: Various GPRAMA provisions are aimed at addressing cross-cutting issues, such as cross-agency and agency priority goals and related data-driven reviews of progress towards those goals. To ensure alignment with the current administration's priorities, OMB's 2017 guidance removed the priority status of those goals, which stopped quarterly data-driven reviews and related public progress reports until new goals are published. OMB plans to resume implementation of these provisions in February 2018. GPRAMA also requires OMB and agencies to implement an inventory of federal programs, which could help decision makers better identify and manage fragmentation, overlap, and duplication. OMB and agencies implemented the inventory once, in May 2013. In October 2014, GAO found several issues limited the usefulness of that inventory. Since then, OMB has postponed updating the inventory, citing among other reasons the passage of subsequent laws. OMB has yet to develop a systematic approach for resuming implementation of the inventory and specific time frames for doing so. A systematic approach to developing the inventory could help ensure it provides useful information for decision makers and the public. Performance information: Survey results show federal managers generally reported no improvements in their use of performance information in decision making for various management activities, or practices that can enhance such use, since GAO's 2013 survey. For example, the use of performance information to streamline programs to reduce duplicative activities (an estimated 33 percent in 2017) is statistically significantly lower relative to 2013 (44 percent). In contrast, managers who were familiar with and whose programs were subject to quarterly data-driven reviews reported that those reviews were used to make progress toward agency priority goals. Identifying and sharing practices to expand the use of such reviews—for other performance goals and at lower levels within agencies—could lead to increased use of performance information. Daily operations: Agencies have made progress in developing results-oriented cultures but need to take additional actions. GAO's past work found that high-performing organizations use performance management systems to help individuals connect their daily activities to organizational goals. In 2017, about half of federal managers reported using performance information when setting expectations with employees (no change from GAO's last survey in 2013). Transparent and open government: GAO's past work identified a number of needed improvements to Performance.gov, the central government-wide website required by GPRAMA. The site is to provide quarterly updates on priority goals in effect through September 2017, but those updates stopped in December 2016. According to OMB, the existing information for cross-agency priority goals is the final update, and agencies should publish final updates on their priority goals in annual performance reports. Performance.gov does not provide users with this information, thereby limiting the transparency and accessibility of those results. In addition to following through on plans to resume implementation of key GPRAMA provisions, GAO recommends that OMB (1) consider a systematic approach to developing the program inventory, (2) revise guidance to provide specific time frames for inventory implementation, (3) identify and share practices for expanding the use of data-driven reviews, and (4) update Performance.gov to explain that reporting on priority goals was suspended and provide the location of final progress updates.

{"pred": " The Colorado River Basin, spanning over 246,000 square miles and flowing through seven U.S. states and Mexico, is a critical water source for millions of people and diverse ecosystems. The Bureau of Reclamation, under the Department of the Interior, plays a central role in managing the basin's water, particularly in the Lower Basin, where it serves as the water master. Federal facilities provide low-cost water and hydropower, supporting agriculture, municipal, and industrial uses. The river's flow is vital for power generation, wildlife, and recreation, but it faces severe challenges due to prolonged drought and climate change. The Colorado River Compact of 1922, which divided the river into Upper and Lower Basins, was later modified by the Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928, which authorized the construction of Hoover Dam and related infrastructure. The compact allocated 7.5 million acre-feet (MAF) annually to each basin, with the Lower Basin having an additional 1 MAF. The agreement also required the Upper Basin to deliver 75 MAF over any 10-year period, allowing for averaging over time to make up for low-flow years. The compact was not to become binding until it had been approved by the legislatures of each of the signatory states and by Congress. Congress approved and modified the Colorado River Compact in the Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928. The act ratified the 1922 compact, authorized the construction of a federal facility to impound water in the Lower Basin (Boulder Dam, later renamed Hoover Dam) and related facilities to deliver water in Southern California (e.g., the All-American Canal, which delivers Colorado River water to California's Imperial Valley). It provided 4.4 MAF per year to California, 2.8 MAF to Arizona, and 300,000 AF to Nevada, with the states to divide any surplus waters among them. It also directed the Secretary of the Interior to serve as the sole contracting authority for Colorado River water use in the Lower Basin and authorized several storage projects for study in the Upper Basin. Congress's approval of the compact in the BCPA was conditioned on a number of factors, including ratification by California and five other states (thereby allowing the compact to become effective without Arizona's concurrence), and California agreeing by act of its legislature to limit its water use to 4.4 MAF per year and not more than half of any surplus waters", "answers": ["The Colorado River Basin covers more than 246,000 square miles in seven U.S. states (Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and California) and Mexico. Pursuant to federal law, the Bureau of Reclamation (part of the Department of the Interior) manages much of the basin's water supplies. Colorado River water is used primarily for agricultural irrigation and municipal and industrial (M&I) uses, but it also is important for power production, fish and wildlife, and recreational uses. In recent years, consumptive uses of Colorado River water have exceeded natural flows. This causes an imbalance in the basin's available supplies and competing demands. A drought in the basin dating to 2000 has raised the prospect of water delivery curtailments and decreased hydropower production, among other things. In the future, observers expect that increasing demand for supplies, coupled with the effects of climate change, will further increase the strain on the basin's limited water supplies. River Management The Law of the River is the commonly used shorthand for the multiple laws, court decisions, and other documents governing Colorado River operations. The foundational document of the Law of the River is the Colorado River Compact of 1922. Pursuant to the compact, the basin states established a framework to apportion the water supplies between the Upper and Lower Basins of the Colorado River, with the dividing line between the two basins at Lee Ferry, AZ (near the Utah border). The Upper and Lower Basins each were allocated 7.5 million acre-feet (MAF) annually under the Colorado River Compact; an additional 1.5 MAF in annual flows was made available to Mexico under a 1944 treaty. Future agreements and court decisions addressed numerous other issues (including intrastate allocations of flows), and subsequent federal legislation provided authority and funding for federal facilities that allowed users to develop their allocations. A Supreme Court ruling also confirmed that Congress designated the Secretary of the Interior as the water master for the Lower Basin, a role in which the federal government manages the delivery of all water below Hoover Dam. Reclamation and basin stakeholders closely track the status of two large reservoirs—Lake Powell in the Upper Basin and Lake Mead in the Lower Basin—as an indicator of basin storage conditions. Under recent guidelines, dam releases from these facilities are tied to specific water storage levels. For Lake Mead, the first tier of \"shortage,\" under which Arizona's and Nevada's allocations would be decreased, would be triggered if Lake Mead's January 1 elevation is expected to fall below 1,075 feet above mean sea level. As of early 2019, Reclamation projected that there was a 69% chance of a shortage condition at Lake Mead in 2020; there was also a lesser chance of Lake Powell reaching critically low levels. Improved hydrology in early 2019 may decrease the chances of shortage in the immediate future. Drought Contingency Plans Despite previous efforts to alleviate future shortages, the basin's hydrological outlook has generally worsened in recent years. After several years of negotiations, in early 2019 Reclamation and the basin states transmitted to Congress additional plans to alleviate stress on basin water supplies. These plans, known as the drought contingency plans (DCPs) for the Upper and Lower Basins, were authorized by Congress in April 2019 in the Colorado River Drought Contingency Plan Authorization Act (P.L. 116-14). The DCPs among other things obligate Lower Basin states to additional water supply cutbacks at specified storage levels (i.e., cutbacks beyond previous curtailment plans), commit Reclamation to additional water conservation efforts, and coordinate Upper Basin operations to protect Lake Powell storage levels and hydropower generation. Congressional Role Congress plays a multifaceted role in federal management of the Colorado River basin. Congress funds and oversees management of basin facilities, including operations and programs to protect and restore endangered species. It has also enacted and continues to consider Indian water rights settlements involving Colorado River waters and development of new water storage facilities in the basin. In addition, Congress has approved funding to mitigate water shortages and conserve basin water supplies and has enacted new authorities to combat drought and its effects on basin water users (i.e., the DCPs and other related efforts)."], "all_classes": null, "length": 7367}
{"pred": " The report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) examines the availability and usefulness of government-wide data on collections of fees, fines, and penalties. It highlights that while the federal government receives significant funds from these sources—over $350 billion in fiscal year 2017—there is no comprehensive, publicly accessible dataset that includes specific fees, fines, or penalties. The report explains that fees are charges for goods or services provided by the government, such as park entry fees or FDA application fees. Fines and penalties are imposed as punishment for criminal violations or to enforce federal laws and regulations. The report outlines the different types of collections based on statutory authority: offsetting collections, offsetting receipts, and governmental receipts. Offsetting collections are generally available for agency obligation without an additional annual appropriation, while offsetting receipts and governmental receipts involve greater congressional control and oversight. The report also discusses the challenges in defining and standardizing data elements for fees, fines, and penalties, including privacy concerns and the need for legal analysis. It notes that while government-wide reporting of fee, fine, and penalty data could enhance transparency and oversight, it would require significant resources and planning. The GAO recommends that the Director of OMB make more disaggregated data on fees, fines, and penalties available, describe the criteria for identifying accounts with fees, and update the Public Budget Database User’s Guide to clarify that budget authority is reported net of offsetting collections. The report underscores the importance of transparency and accountability in federal spending, while acknowledging the complexities involved in achieving it.\n\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this GAO report.

The report discusses how these collections are categorized, like offsetting collections, offsetting receipts, and governmental receipts. It also talks about the challenges in defining data standards for these collections, such as privacy issues and the need for legal analysis.

The GAO makes four recommendations to the Director of OMB. \n\nSo, the summary needs to capture the main points: the lack", "answers": ["Congress has authorized federal agencies to collect hundreds of billions of dollars annually in fees, fines, and penalties. These collections can fund a variety of programs, including programs related to national security, and the protection of natural resources. Data on collections are important for congressional oversight and to provide transparency in agencies' use of federal resources. GAO was asked to review the availability of government-wide data on fees, fines, and penalties. This report examines (1) the extent to which data on collections of fees, fines, and penalties are publically available and useful for the purpose of congressional oversight; and (2) the benefits and challenges to government-wide reporting of fees, fines, and penalties. GAO assessed government-wide fee, fine, and penalty data against criteria for availability and usefulness based on multiple sources, including prior GAO work and input from staff of selected congressional committees. GAO interviewed OMB staff, Treasury officials, and representatives of organizations with expertise in federal budget issues and reviewed prior GAO work to identify benefits and challenges of reporting these data. There are no comprehensive, government-wide data at the level of detail that identifies specific fees, fines, or penalties. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) report data that include these collections at the budget account level, which generally covers a set of agency activities or programs. OMB and Treasury also report some summary data for budgeting and financial management purposes. In the Budget of the U.S. Government , for example, OMB data showed government-wide fees totaled just over $335 billion in fiscal year 2017. These reports, however, are not designed to inventory or analyze fee, fine, or penalty collections and have significant limitations for that purpose. Although OMB collects more disaggregated data on fees, fines, and penalties, it does not make the data publicly available. OMB uses the disaggregated data in its OMB MAX database—such as the agency and account—to compile reported totals, such as the government-wide fees total in the Budget of the U.S. Government . Until OMB makes more disaggregated data publicly available, Congress has limited information on collections by agency to inform oversight and decision-making. OMB's government-wide total of fees includes collections that are not fees and excludes some fee collections. The total includes all collections for accounts in which fees make up at least half of the account's collections and excludes all others. OMB does not direct agencies to regularly review and update the accounts included in the total. Therefore, if accounts' makeups change such that fee collections drop below, or rise above, the 50 percent threshold, accounts may have incorrect fee designations and the total may be inaccurate. Further, OMB does not disclose the limitation that the total may exclude some fees and include other collections that are not fees. As a result, some users of the data are likely unaware of the potential for the total fees to be overestimated or underestimated. Further, no source of government-wide data consistently reports data elements on fees, fines, and penalties that could help inform congressional oversight. Generally, congressional staff told us that additional data, such as amounts of specific penalties, would increase transparency and facilitate oversight. These data could help Congress identify trends in collections and significant changes that could be an indication of an agency's performance. While reporting government-wide fee, fine, and penalty data provides benefits, there are trade-offs in terms of the time and federal resources it would take to develop and implement a process for agencies to report these data. The level of federal investment would vary depending on factors, such as the number of data elements included and the level of detail reported. Developing a comprehensive and accessible data source would provide greater benefits, but would likely be resource intensive. Alternatively, incorporating a small number of data elements that Congress identifies as most useful for oversight into ongoing government-wide reporting efforts could incrementally improve transparency and information for oversight and decision-making, with fewer resources. GAO is making four recommendations to enhance OMB reporting on fees, fines, and penalties, including making disaggregated data publically available, updating instructions to federal agencies to review accounts designated as containing fees, and disclosing limitations in data reported.

{"pred": " The report provides an overview of the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP), a federal initiative established in 1968 to provide free meals to low-income children during school breaks. Administered by the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act, the SFSP serves meals during summer vacation periods, and other times like school closures due to natural disasters. The program primarily operates during summer months, with the majority of meals served during this period. Federal expenditures on SFSP increased from fiscal years 2007 through 2016, though there was a slight decrease between fiscal years 2015 and 2016. The SFSP is managed at the federal level by FNS, which issues regulations, reviews state program management, and provides reimbursement for eligible meals. At the state level, the program is administered by state agencies and operated by sponsors such as school districts, local governments, or nonprofits. Sponsors are responsible for monitoring their meal sites, managing meal service, and providing training to administrative staff and site operators. Meal sites are physical locations where children receive and consume meals in a supervised setting. The program includes various types of meal sites, such as open sites, closed enrolled sites, and camps. Open sites operate in areas where at least half of the children are eligible for free or reduced-price meals. Children are eligible for free or reduced-price meals if their households have incomes at or below 185 percent of federal poverty guidelines. At open sites, meals are available to all children in the area, and all meals served that meet program requirements are reimbursable. Closed enrolled sites are open only to enrolled children. At closed enrolled sites, meals served to all children in attendance are reimbursable as long as at least half of the enrolled children are eligible for free or reduced-price school meals. Unlike other types of sites, camps are reimbursed only for meals served to children who have been individually determined to be eligible for free or reduced-price school meals. SFSP meals must meet certain requirements to be eligible for federal reimbursement; for example, the meals must be served and consumed on-site at an approved site. Federal reimbursements for summer meals are provided for each breakfast, lunch, supper, or snack served to an eligible child at an eligible site that also meets federal requirements for menu components, scheduled meal times, and nutrition.

In the last decade, federal expenditures for SFSP have increased as the program has expanded, according to USDA data. GAO was asked to review the SFSP. This report examines (1) what is known about SFSP participation, (2) other programs that help feed low-income children over the summer, and (3) challenges, if any, in providing summer meals to children and the extent to which USDA provides assistance to address these challenges. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed USDA's SFSP data for fiscal years 2007 through 2016; surveyed state agencies responsible for administering the SFSP in 50 states and the District of Columbia; visited a nongeneralizable group of 3 states and 30 meal sites, selected based on Census data on child poverty rates and urban and rural locations; analyzed meal site data from the 3 states; and interviewed USDA, state and national organization officials, and SFSP providers, including sponsors and site operators. Nationwide, the total number of meals served to children in low-income areas through the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) increased from 113 to 149 million (about 32 percent) from fiscal year 2007 through 2016. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) directs states to use the number of meals served, along with other data, to estimate the number of children participating in the SFSP. However, participation estimates have been calculated inconsistently from state to state and year to year. In 2017, USDA took steps to improve the consistency of participation estimates, noting they are critical for informing program implementation and strategic planning. However, GAO determined that the method USDA directs states to use will continue to provide unreliable estimates of participation, hindering USDA's ability to use them for these purposes. Other federal and nonfederal programs help feed low-income children over the summer to some extent, according to states GAO surveyed and SFSP providers and others GAO interviewed. For example, in July 2016, USDA data indicate about 26 million meals were served through a separate federal program that allows school meal providers to serve summer meals. Some children also received summer meals through nonfederal programs operated by faith-based organizations and foodbanks, though GAO's state survey and interviews with providers and national organizations indicate the reach of such efforts is limited. States and SFSP providers reported challenges with meal sites, participation, and program administration; USDA has taken steps to address these areas. Specifically, in GAO's survey, a majority of states reported challenges with availability and awareness of meal sites, as well as limited program participation and administrative capacity. National, state, and local officials have taken steps to address these issues, such as increasing outreach and offering activities to attract participation. In addition, 17 states in GAO's survey and providers in the states GAO visited reported a challenge with ensuring meal sites are in safe locations. To address this safety issue, USDA has granted some states and sponsors flexibility from the requirement that children consume meals on-site. However, USDA has not broadly communicated the circumstances it considers when granting this flexibility. Further, some states and sponsors that have requested this flexibility reported difficulty obtaining data to show these circumstances exist, hampering their ability to ensure safe meal delivery. GAO is making four recommendations, including that USDA improve estimates of children's participation in SFSP and communicate the circumstances it considers when granting flexibilities to ensure safe meal delivery. USDA generally agreed with GAO's recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 11048}
{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this Medicare report. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points. \n\nThe report is from the GAO, right? It's about Medicare, its programs, and the challenges related to fraud, waste, and abuse. The main points seem to be the structure of Medicare, the financial aspects, the issue of fraud, and the steps CMS is taking to combat it. \n\nFirst, Medicare is one of four programs by CMS, covering people over 65, disabled, and ESRD. The report mentions that Medicare is the largest CMS program, costing $702 billion in 2017, and projected to reach $1.5 trillion by 2028. \n\nThen there's a part about fraud. The report says that fraud is hard to detect because it's intentional deception. Also, there are no reliable estimates of the extent of fraud in Medicare or the healthcare industry. Fraud is difficult to detect because it's intentional. The process involves identifying, investigating, prosecuting, and adjudicating before fraud can be established. \n\nThen, the report mentions that Medicare was designated a high-risk program in 1990 due to its size, scope, and complexity. Also, OMB designated all parts of Medicare as high-priority programs because they report $750 million or more in improper payments in a year. \n\nThe report also talks about improper payments, which can include payments due to fraud. However, improper payments are not a proxy for the amount of fraud or the extent of fraud risk in a program. \n\nThen, CMS's approach to combating fraud is part of a broader program integrity strategy. They work with contractors, insurance plans, and law enforcement. \n\nThe Fraud Risk Framework is a guide for agencies to manage fraud risks. It has four components: commit, assess, design and implement, evaluate and adapt. \n\nThe report states that CMS has not conducted a fraud risk assessment for Medicare as a whole. They have focused on specific provider groups. However, without a comprehensive fraud risk assessment, CMS may not be able to design and implement the most effective control activities to address the full range of fraud risks. \n\nAlso, the report mentions that CMS has established monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for its program integrity activities. These could be incorporated into an antifraud strategy for Medicare. \n\nThe report also discusses the", "answers": ["Medicare covered over 58 million people in 2017 and has wide-ranging impact on the health-care sector and the overall U.S. economy. However, the billions of dollars in Medicare outlays as well as program complexity make it susceptible to improper payments, including fraud. Although there are no reliable estimates of fraud in Medicare, in fiscal year 2017 improper payments for Medicare were estimated at about $52 billion. Further, about $1.4 billion was returned to Medicare Trust Funds in fiscal year 2017 as a result of recoveries, fines, and asset forfeitures. In December 2017, GAO issued a report examining how CMS managed its fraud risks overall and particularly the extent to which its efforts in the Medicare and Medicaid programs aligned with GAO's Framework. This testimony, based on that report, discusses the extent to which CMS's management of fraud risks in Medicare aligns with the Framework. For the report, GAO reviewed CMS policies and interviewed officials and external stakeholders. In its December 2017 report, GAO found that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) antifraud efforts for Medicare partially align with GAO's 2015 A Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs (Framework). The Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015 required OMB to incorporate leading practices identified in this Framework in its guidance to agencies on addressing fraud risks. Consistent with the Framework, GAO determined that CMS had demonstrated commitment to combating fraud by creating a dedicated entity to lead antifraud efforts; the Center for Program Integrity (CPI) serves as this entity for fraud, waste, and abuse issues in Medicare. CMS also promoted an antifraud culture by, for example, coordinating with internal stakeholders to incorporate antifraud features into new program design. To increase awareness of fraud risks in Medicare, CMS offered and required training for stakeholder groups such as providers of medical services, but it did not offer or require similar fraud-awareness training for most of its workforce. CMS took some steps to identify fraud risks in Medicare; however, it had not conducted a fraud risk assessment or designed and implemented a risk-based antifraud strategy for Medicare as defined in the Framework. CMS identified fraud risks through control activities that target areas the agency designated as higher risk within Medicare, including specific provider types, such as home health agencies. Building on earlier steps and conducting a fraud risk assessment, consistent with the Framework, would provide the detailed information and insights needed to create a fraud risk profile, which, in turn, is the basis for creating an antifraud strategy. CMS established monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for its program-integrity control activities that, if aligned with an antifraud strategy, could enhance the effectiveness of fraud risk management in Medicare. For example, CMS used return-on-investment and savings estimates to measure the effectiveness of its Medicare program-integrity activities. In developing an antifraud strategy, consistent with the Framework, CMS could include plans for refining and building on existing methods such as return-on-investment, to evaluate the effectiveness of all of its antifraud efforts. In its December 2017 report, GAO made three recommendations, namely that CMS (1) require and provide fraud-awareness training to its employees; (2) conduct fraud risk assessments; and (3) create an antifraud strategy for Medicare, including an approach for evaluation. The Department of Health and Human Services agreed with these recommendations and reportedly is evaluating options to implement them. Accordingly, the recommendations remain open."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5746}
{"pred": " (One page, 500 words)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about the Social Security Administration (SSA). Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report starts by explaining SSA's mission and the three main programs they administer: Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI), Disability Insurance (DI), and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). It gives figures for fiscal year 2019, like $892 billion in OASI benefits to 54 million people, $149 billion in DI to 10 million, and $59 billion in SSI to 8 million. Then it talks about SSA's reliance on IT systems, like handling transactions, maintaining records, and evaluating eligibility. The IT systems supported about 185 million transactions daily in 2015. The Office of the Deputy Commissioner for Systems manages these IT systems, with around 3,800 staff.\n\nBut there are challenges in managing IT. The report mentions previous reports highlighting weaknesses in system development practices, governance, requirements management, and strategic planning. These issues have led to the need for stronger IT management controls. In 2016, the acting commissioner stated that the aging IT infrastructure was not sustainable due to high maintenance costs. The agency requested $132 million in fiscal year 2019 budget for modernizing IT environment. This includes updating database designs to relational databases, eliminating outdated code, and upgrading infrastructure.\n\nOne of the key initiatives is the Disability Case Processing System, which has been under development since 2010. It aims to replace 52 disparate systems with a modern one. However, the system has faced issues like software quality and poor performance. Because of this, the OMB placed the initiative on its government-wide list of 10 high-priority programs requiring attention.\n\nThe report also discusses FITARA (Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act) and Executive Order 13833, which aim to enhance the role of CIOs in IT management. These laws and orders emphasize the importance of CIOs in strategic planning, portfolio management, and cybersecurity.\n\nIn terms of cybersecurity, the report notes that SSA had a reliable baseline assessment, which covered all reportable information, such as the extent to which personnel without professional certifications were ready to obtain them or strategies for mitigating any gaps. However, SSA has ongoing work related to its cybersecurity workforce, standardized", "answers": ["SSA delivers services that touch the lives of almost every American, and relies heavily on IT resources to do so. Its systems support a range of activities, such as processing Disability Insurance payments, to calculating and withholding Medicare premiums, and issuing Social Security numbers and cards. For fiscal year 2018, the agency planned to spend approximately $1.6 billion on IT. GAO has previously reported that federal IT projects have often failed, in part, due to a lack of oversight and governance. Given the challenges that federal agencies, including SSA, have encountered in managing IT acquisitions, Congress and the administration have taken steps to improve federal IT, including enacting federal IT acquisition reform legislation and issuing related guidance. This statement summarizes GAO's previously reported findings regarding SSA's management of IT acquisitions and operations. In developing this testimony, GAO summarized findings from its reports issued in 2011 through 2018, and information on SSA's actions in response to GAO's recommendations. The Social Security Administration (SSA) has improved its management of information technology (IT) acquisitions and operations by addressing 14 of the 15 recommendations that GAO has made to the agency. For example, Incremental development . The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has emphasized the need for agencies to deliver IT investments in smaller increments to reduce risk and deliver capabilities more quickly. In November 2017, GAO reported that agencies, including SSA, needed to improve their certification of incremental development. As a result, GAO recommended that SSA's CIO (1) report incremental development information accurately, and (2) update its incremental development policy and processes. SSA implemented both recommendations. Software licenses . Effective management of software licenses can help avoid purchasing too many licenses that result in unused software. In May 2014, GAO reported that most agencies, including SSA, lacked comprehensive software license policies. As a result, GAO made six recommendations to SSA, to include developing a comprehensive software licenses policy and inventory. SSA implemented all six recommendations. However, SSA's IT management policies have not fully addressed the role of its CIO. Various laws and related guidance assign IT management responsibilities to CIOs in six key areas. In August 2018, GAO reported that SSA had fully addressed the role of the CIO in one of the six areas (see table). Specifically, SSA's policies fully addressed the CIO's role in the IT leadership and accountability area by requiring the CIO to report directly to the agency head, among other things. In contrast, SSA's policies did not address or minimally addressed the IT workforce and IT strategic planning areas. For example, SSA's policies did not include requirements for the CIO to annually assess the extent to which personnel meet IT management skill requirements or to measure how well IT supports agency programs. GAO recommended that SSA address the weaknesses in the remaining five key areas. SSA agreed with GAO's recommendation and stated that the agency plans to implement the recommendation by the end of this month. GAO has made 15 recommendations to SSA to improve its management of IT acquisitions and operations from 2011 through 2018, and 1 recommendation to improve its CIO policies. While SSA has implemented nearly all of them, it would be better positioned to overcome longstanding IT management challenges when it addresses the CIO's role in its policies."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3733}
{"pred": " (One page, 500 words)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report about federal fees and user charges. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the main points.\n\nThe report talks about how the federal government collects various fees and charges from businesses and households. These fees are different from taxes and have administrative and economic consequences. Some fees are for services like national parks, others are tied to regulatory activities, and some are internal government transactions. For example, OPM charges other agencies for background checks. \n\nThe report mentions that user fees can be a significant portion of some agencies' budgets, like SEC, FERC, PTO, FTC. In FY2017, user fees accounted for $331 billion, about 10% of total federal receipts. \n\nUser fees are voluntary, but not paying them can make certain activities impossible. Like needing a passport to fly. Or SEC filing fees for securities. \n\nThe report also discusses the advantages and disadvantages of user fees. Advantages include voluntary nature, connecting costs to beneficiaries, and decentralizing decision-making. Disadvantages include fluctuations in economic conditions and potential bypass of congressional oversight.\n\nThere's a part about the statutory basis for fees varying in specificity and discretion. Some are detailed, others rely on broader authorities. \n\nThe Government Accountability Office (GAO) defines user fees as charges for goods or services provided by the federal government. OMB includes transactions like land sales. \n\nThe federal government uses modified cash accounting, so asset losses aren't recorded in budget accounts. For example, selling oil at $60 when bought at $120, only revenue is shown. \n\nThe report also touches on the economic efficiency and fairness of user fees. The benefit principle suggests linking costs to those who benefit. For example, passport fees. \n\nThere's a mention of the Budget Appendix, which provides detailed subaccount-level data but is impractical for research. \n\nThe U.S. Treasury provides data on user fees, including the Combined Statement and Monthly Treasury Statement. \n\nThe report discusses the role of user fees in financing public activities, their advantages, and the challenges they pose. \n\nAlso, there's a part about the debate over whether user fees should be considered as taxes or not. For example, the Travel Promotion Act fees are not taxes. \n\nThe report also mentions the need for better data and transparency regarding user fees. \n\nSo, the summary needs to cover the key points: what user fees are,", "answers": ["The federal government collects various fees from businesses and households. Choosing to raise public funds via user fees, as opposed to other means such as taxes, has important administrative and economic consequences. Many fees stem from \"business-like activities,\" in which the government provides a service or benefit in return for payment. For example, many national parks charge entry fees, which then help fund maintenance projects. Such fees and charges that result from voluntary choices, such as entering a national park, are distinguished from taxes—which stem from the government's sovereign power to compel payments. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) defines a user fee as a \"fee assessed to users for goods or services provided by the federal government. User fees generally apply to federal programs or activities that provide special benefits to identifiable recipients above and beyond what is normally available to the public.\" User fees and charges have several advantages as a means of financing public activities. They are voluntary, they connect the burden of financing activities to those who directly benefit from them, and can help decentralize decisionmaking by bypassing centralized allocation of resources. Some have expressed concerns that user fee arrangements may bypass regular congressional scrutiny and dilute Congress's power of the purse. Collections of fees and charges may also be more sensitive to economic fluctuations, which could complicate financing of programs dependent on those revenue streams. Many user fees or charges are classified as offsetting collections, which are deposited into expenditure accounts. Offsetting collections can be used to offset agency spending and typically require no further congressional approval to use. Other fees and charges are classified as offsetting receipts, which are collected into revenue accounts and typically require congressional authorization to be spent. User fees and charges can be classified as discretionary or mandatory spending, depending on how they are legally authorized. The levels and administration of some fees are specified in detailed statutory text, while other fees are created under broader agency authorities. Certain agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have increased their reliance on user fees in past decades. Some critics have raised concerns that increased reliance on user fees could shift incentives facing those agencies. Some legislative proposals, such as H.R. 850 introduced in the 115th Congress, would limit or eliminate most exceptions and require most fees and charges to be deposited in the U.S. Treasury General Fund. Congress could fund agencies and activities now funded in whole or in part via user fees directly through the annual appropriations process. Such proposals would mark a departure from past practice. Statutory text governing many fees has evolved over many years and involves substantive policy decisions, often related to the industry or programmatic concerns. A general change in funding from user fees and charges to annual appropriations would likely shift the division of responsibilities between authorizing committees and appropriations committees. Congress may also enhance its oversight of agencies reliant on user fees by requiring more timely and detailed financial reports as well as more precise and systematic explanations of linkages between those fees and associated programs. Congress could also ask for greater transparency in fiscal data. While the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the U.S. Treasury Bureau of the Fiscal Service provide extensive data on user fees and charges, it is difficult to conduct governmentwide analyses using publicly available sources. Congress could mandate more detailed and more easily accessed data on user fees and charges. Additional funding may be needed to develop the capacity to issue those data."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4022}
{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about military base management in the U.S. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report starts by explaining that the U.S. Constitution doesn't clearly specify how military bases should be managed. Article II, Section 2 gives the President the role of commander-in-chief, which includes deploying and redeploying forces. But Article I, Section 8 gives Congress the power to raise armies and regulate the militia. Over time, Congress has passed laws that limit the President's ability to close or realign bases. \n\nIn 1977, there was a law (10 U.S.C. 2687) that limited the President's power to close or realign bases. This law required the DOD to do comprehensive assessments before closing bases, which could be challenged in court. This law effectively stopped the President from closing or realigning major bases. \n\nThen in 1988, the first BRAC process was started, which allowed for the closure of bases based on objective criteria. The process has been modified over time, with the most recent BRAC round in 2005. The BRAC process involves an independent commission that reviews and certifies the recommendations of the Secretary of Defense. The commission is made up of members appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate. The process has several elements, including objective criteria for evaluating basing recommendations, GAO review and certification of DOD data, open hearings, solicitation of feedback, installation visits, and public availability of data. The process has a timeline with several key milestones, including the DOD force structure plan, infrastructure inventory, and analysis of options (up to four years); nomination and confirmation of BRAC commissioners; DOD submission of BRAC recommendations (and associated reports) to the commission; commission deliberations (typically four months); final report sent to the President for approval; 45-day deadline for Congress to reject recommendations in toto (Joint Resolution of Disapproval) or allow implementation to begin; DOD implementation (two years to begin; six years to complete); and DOD disposal of real property (indeterminate). \n\nThe BRAC process is the main way the DOD disposes of excess infrastructure. Each year between 2013 and 2017, the Department", "answers": ["Since 1977, statutory thresholds have effectively constrained the President's ability to close or realign major military installations in the United States. Congress has instead periodically granted temporary authorities—known as a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC)—that have established independent commissions for the review and approval of basing changes submitted by the Secretary of Defense. These unique and transient authorities last expired on April 16, 2006. There have been five rounds of base closures: 1988, 1991, 1993, 1995, and 2005. Though Congress has periodically adjusted the BRAC process to account for lessons learned, the modern framework has remained generally consistent with earlier rounds, and includes establishment of an independent commission; reliance on objective and uniform criteria; Government Accountability Office (GAO) review and certification of Department of Defense (DOD) data; deliberations designed to be transparent that include open hearings, solicitation of feedback, installation visits, and data available for public review; and requirement that the final list of closure and realignment recommendations be accepted or rejected in their entirety. Congress has defined BRAC selection criteria in statute, thus requiring the Secretary to prioritize military value over cost savings. Additionally, Congress has required the Secretary to align the Department's recommendations with a comprehensive 20-year force structure plan. The commission may modify, reject, or add recommendations during its review before forwarding a final list to the President. After receiving the Commission's list of recommendations, the President may either accept the report in its entirety or seek to modify it by indicating disapproval and returning it to the commission for further evaluation. If the President accepts the commission's recommendations, they are forwarded to Congress. BRAC implementation begins by default unless Congress rejects the recommendations in their entirety within 45 days by enacting a joint resolution. During the implementation phase, DOD is required to initiate closures and realignments within two years and complete all actions within six years. The BRAC process represents a legislative compromise between the executive and legislative branches wherein each shares power in managing the closure and realignment of military bases. The imposition of an independent, third-party mediator was intended to insulate base closings from political considerations by both branches that had complicated similar actions in the past.

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report is about the Title IV programs under the HEA, which provide financial aid to students. It mentions that in 2016-2017, there were 6,760 Title IV eligible institutions. These include public, private nonprofit, and proprietary (for-profit) institutions. The report breaks down the percentages: 29.4% public, 27.8% private nonprofit, and 42.9% proprietary. The total amount of aid was $122.5 billion in FY2017. \n\nThe main sections of the report discuss the program integrity triad: state authorization, accreditation, and ED certification. Each of these components has its own set of requirements. For example, state authorization ensures that the institution is legally allowed to operate in the state, accreditation ensures quality, and ED certification ensures fiscal responsibility and administrative capability. \n\nThe report also goes into detail about the different types of institutions: public, private nonprofit, and proprietary. Each has specific criteria. For example, proprietary institutions must derive at least 10% of their revenue from non-Title IV sources. There are also specific rules for distance education and correspondence courses, like the 50% rules. \n\nThen there's a section on program eligibility, which includes the types of programs that are eligible for Title IV aid. The report explains that programs must lead to a degree or certificate, or prepare students for gainful employment. \n\nThe gainful employment rules are a big part of the report. They require institutions to meet certain performance standards and disclose information to students. The rules were delayed and there's a proposed rule to rescind them. The debt-to-earnings ratios are calculated, and programs that fail for two consecutive years are ineligible. \n\nThe report also covers Program Participation Agreements, campus safety policies, return of funds, and distance education. \n\nI need to condense all this into a one-page summary.

For students attending such institutions to be able to receive Title IV assistance, an institution must meet basic criteria, including offering at least one eligible program of education (e.g., programs leading to a degree or preparing a student for gainful employment in a recognized occupation). In addition, an IHE must satisfy the program integrity triad, under which it must be licensed or otherwise legally authorized to operate in the state in which it is physically located, accredited or preaccredited by an agency recognized for that purpose by the Department of Education (ED), and certified by ED as eligible to participate in Title IV programs. These requirements are intended to provide a balance between consumer protection, quality assurance, and oversight and compliance in postsecondary education providers participating in Title IV student aid programs. An IHE must also fulfill a variety of other related requirements, including those that relate to institutional recruiting practices, student policies and procedures, and the administration of the Title IV student aid programs. Finally, additional criteria may apply to an institution depending on its control or the type of educational programs it offers. For example, proprietary institutions must meet HEA requirements that are otherwise inapplicable to public and private nonprofit institutions, including deriving at least 10% of their revenues from non-Title IV funds (also known as the 90/10 rule).

{"pred": " The report provides an overview of Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD), its potential impact on the United States, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) strategies for responding to an outbreak. FMD is a highly contagious viral disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals, causing fever and painful lesions on their hooves, mouths, and udders. While it does not infect humans, it leads to significant productivity losses in livestock. The United States has not had an FMD outbreak since 1929, but the disease could be introduced from countries in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, or South America where it is present. The U.S. livestock sector is vulnerable to FMD transmission due to its large size and mobility. The report highlights the economic consequences of an FMD outbreak, referencing the 2001 UK outbreak which resulted in the killing of over 6 million animals and significant financial losses. The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is the lead agency for responding to FMD and other foreign animal diseases. The report outlines USDA activities to detect, control, and eradicate FMD, including surveillance, epidemiologic tracing, diagnostic testing, and biosecurity measures. It also discusses the roles of federal, state, tribal, and industry stakeholders in FMD control. The report emphasizes the importance of FMD vaccines, which can provide protection against specific subtypes of the virus. However, the current supply of vaccine is limited, and there is no consensus on how to allocate it in an outbreak. The report also identifies 11 key challenges that USDA would face in responding to an FMD outbreak, including surveillance, diagnosis, information management, animal traceability, biosecurity, depopulation, disposal, resource allocation, and communication coordination. These challenges are based on the analysis of USDA documents, reports on FMD outbreaks in other countries, and after-action reports from preparedness exercises. The report also discusses how USDA identifies, prioritizes, and monitors corrective actions to address these challenges. The report concludes that while USDA has developed a comprehensive approach for responding to FMD, there are still significant gaps in the preparedness and response capabilities. The report recommends that the Administrator of APHIS follow the agency's procedures to prioritize corrective actions and monitor their completion.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report about Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) and the USDA's response strategies. Let me start by understanding the main points of the report.\n\nFirst", "answers": ["FMD is a highly contagious viral disease that causes painful lesions on the hooves and mouths of some livestock, making it difficult for them to stand or eat, thus greatly reducing meat and milk production. The United States has not had an FMD outbreak since 1929, but FMD is present in much of the world. An FMD outbreak in the United States could have serious economic impacts, in part because trade partners would likely halt all imports of U.S. livestock and livestock products until the disease was eradicated. These imports were valued at more than $19 billion in 2017. GAO was asked to review USDA's efforts to prepare for an FMD outbreak. This report examines (1) USDA's planned approach for responding to an FMD outbreak; (2) challenges USDA would face in pursuing its response goals; and (3) how USDA identifies, prioritizes, and monitors corrective actions to mitigate the challenges. GAO observed a USDA FMD preparedness exercise; reviewed agency documents and nongeneralizable questionnaire responses from 29 respondents from federal and state government, livestock industries, and universities; and interviewed officials from federal and state governments and representatives of livestock industries and universities. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) planned approach for responding to an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) includes several strategies. These strategies generally rely on killing infected and susceptible animals, vaccinating uninfected animals, or a combination of both approaches. USDA would implement one or more of the strategies, depending on factors such as the outbreak's size and the resources available, according to agency documents. USDA would likely face significant challenges in pursuing its response goals of detecting, controlling, and containing FMD quickly; eradicating FMD while seeking to stabilize industry and the economy; and facilitating continuity of commerce in uninfected animals. GAO identified challenges in 11 areas—including allocating a limited supply of FMD vaccine—based on its review of USDA documents, responses to GAO's questionnaire, and interviews with agency officials and others with expertise on FMD. According to USDA, the agency may not have a sufficient supply of FMD vaccine to control more than a small outbreak because of limited resources to obtain vaccine. As shown below, the current vaccine supply would be sufficient to protect about 14 percent of Texas's cattle or about 4 percent of Iowa's swine; these states' cattle and swine populations are the nation's largest. The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 includes a provision to increase the FMD vaccine supply. USDA has identified dozens of corrective actions to mitigate the challenges of responding to an FMD outbreak, as called for in USDA procedures, but has not prioritized these corrective actions or monitored their completion, as also called for in its procedures. USDA has identified the corrective actions through exercises simulating FMD outbreaks, surveys, and lessons learned from other foreign animal disease outbreaks. However, USDA has not completed all of the corrective actions, including actions related to vaccination. Agency officials stated that they have not completed such corrective actions because they have been responding to outbreaks of other animal diseases and have limited resources. Without following agency procedures to prioritize and monitor corrective actions, USDA cannot ensure that it is allocating its resources to the most beneficial actions to prepare for a possible FMD outbreak. GAO is recommending that USDA follow its procedures to prioritize and monitor the completion of corrective actions that the agency has identified for FMD preparedness. USDA agreed with these recommendations, and described actions it will take to implement them."], "all_classes": null, "length": 11771}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report to understand the main points. The report is about opioid use and the government's efforts to address the opioid crisis through Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT). \n\nFirst, the report explains how opioids are used, their effects, and the risks of misuse and addiction. It mentions that opioids are prescribed for pain and other conditions, come in different forms, and can lead to tolerance and dependence. Misuse is a big issue, leading to addiction and death. Symptoms of opioid use disorder are listed, like strong desire, inability to control use, and continued use despite negative consequences.\n\nThen, the report talks about MAT, which combines medication (methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone) and behavioral therapy. It states that MAT is more effective than abstinence-based treatment. The three FDA-approved medications for MAT are methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone. \n\nEach medication is described: Methadone is a full agonist, used for detox and maintenance. Buprenorphine is a partial agonist, used for detox and maintenance. Naltrexone is an antagonist, used for relapse prevention after detox. \n\nThe report also discusses the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 (DATA 2000) and how they regulate the use of these medications. For example, OTPs can provide MAT, and practitioners can prescribe buprenorphine with certain restrictions. \n\nThere are grant programs under HHS, like the MAT-PDOA, Substance Abuse Service Expansion Supplement to Health Centers, and others. These grants aim to increase access to MAT in high-risk communities. \n\nAdditionally, the report mentions the expansion of waivers to allow more practitioners to prescribe buprenorphine, including nurse practitioners and physician assistants. \n\nThe report also highlights the importance of MAT in reducing opioid use disorders and overdose deaths. \n\nHowever, the report points out that HHS hasn't established specific performance measures with targets for expanding access to MAT. \n\nThe report includes details about the implementation of these grants, the reporting requirements, and the evaluation of the effectiveness of these efforts. \n\nThe main points are: \n\n- Opioids are prescribed for pain and other conditions, come in various forms, and have risks of misuse and addiction. \n\n- MAT is more effective than abstinence-based treatment.", "answers": ["The misuse of prescription opioid pain relievers and illicit opioids, such as heroin, has contributed to increases in overdose deaths. According to the most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, in 2015 over 52,000 people died of drug overdose deaths, and about 63 percent of them involved an opioid. For those who are addicted to or misuse opioids, MAT has been shown to be an effective treatment. GAO was asked to review HHS and other efforts related to MAT for opioid use disorders. This report (1) describes HHS's key efforts to expand access to MAT, (2) examines HHS's evaluation, if any, of its efforts to expand access to MAT, and (3) describes efforts by selected stakeholders (states, private health insurers, and national associations) to expand access to MAT. GAO gathered information from HHS officials as well as a non-generalizable selection of 15 stakeholders selected based on their MAT expansion activities, among other factors. GAO also assessed HHS's evaluation plans using internal control standards for defining objectives and evaluating results. In an effort to reduce the prevalence of opioid misuse and the fatalities associated with it, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) established a goal to expand access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT). MAT is an approach that combines behavioral therapy and the use of certain medications, such as methadone and buprenorphine. HHS has implemented five key efforts since 2015 that focus on expanding access to MAT for opioid use disorders—four grant programs that focus on expanding access to MAT in various settings (including rural primary care practices and health centers) and regulatory changes that expand treatment capacity by increasing patient limits for buprenorphine prescribers and allowing nurse practitioners and physician assistants to prescribe buprenorphine. Some of the grant awards were made in 2015, while others were made as recently as May 2017. (See figure.) As of August 2017, efforts under all the grant programs were ongoing. Grant recipients can use funding to undertake a range of activities, such as hiring and training providers and supporting treatments involving MAT. In addition, certain providers and grant recipients are required to develop plans for preventing MAT medications from being diverted for nonmedical purposes. HHS officials told GAO that as of August 2017, the department was in the process of finalizing its plans to evaluate its efforts to address the opioid epidemic. In September 2016, HHS awarded a contract to conduct the evaluation. HHS officials told GAO that they are still working with the contractor to finalize the evaluation approach and that it will focus on whether HHS's efforts to address the opioid epidemic have been implemented as intended. HHS officials said that in the future, HHS may also evaluate whether, or to what extent, its efforts have been effective in expanding access to MAT, in addition to evaluating implementation. While HHS has some of the information that could be used in a future evaluation of the effectiveness of its efforts to expand access to MAT, it has not adopted specific performance measures with targets specifying the magnitude of the increases HHS hopes to achieve through its efforts to expand access to MAT, and by when. For example, HHS has not established a long-term target specifying the percentage increase in the number of prescriptions for buprenorphine HHS would like to achieve, which would help to show whether efforts by HHS and others are resulting in a sufficient number of prescriptions for MAT medications. HHS has also not chosen a specific method of measuring treatment capacity or established targets associated with it, which would help determine whether a sufficient number of providers are becoming available to evaluate and treat patients who may benefit from MAT. Without specifying these performance measures and associated targets, HHS will not have an effective means to determine whether its efforts are helping to expand access to MAT or whether new approaches are needed. Gauging this progress is particularly important given the large gap identified nationwide between the total number of individuals who could benefit from MAT and the limited number who can currently access it based on provider availability. In addition, GAO also found that as of August 2017, HHS had not finalized its approach for its planned evaluation activities, including timeframes. Without timeframes for the evaluation's activities, HHS increases the risk that the evaluation will not be completed as expeditiously as possible. In addition to HHS efforts to expand access to MAT, officials from selected states, private health insurers, and national associations reported using several efforts to expand patients' access to MAT for opioid use disorders. For example, several stakeholders provided GAO with the following examples of their efforts: States. State health officials from all five selected states have implemented or are planning approaches that focus on integrating the use of MAT into primary care, such as by providing services for centralized intake and initial management of patients or through telehealth that connects patients in rural areas with addiction specialists in a different location. Private health insurers. Three private health insurers reported removing prior authorization requirements for MAT medications so patients can avoid a waiting period before receiving the medications. National associations. Officials told GAO that they are conducting outreach and training for their members and developing tools and resource guides. For example, one association developed a road map with strategies that state policymakers can use to address the opioid epidemic, including strategies for reducing the stigma associated with MAT through educating the public and potential providers. GAO recommends that HHS take two actions: (1) establish performance measures with targets related to expanding access to MAT, and (2) establish timeframes for its evaluation of its efforts to expand access to MAT. HHS concurred with both recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5601}

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report explains the separation of policy and funding in Congress. Authorization bills set up or modify programs, while appropriations bills provide the funding. The Holman rule is a rule that prevents legislative provisions in appropriations bills unless they reduce expenditures. It originated in 1835 and was formalized in 1837. The rule has been modified over time, with some versions allowing more provisions than others. The rule allows certain amendments that reduce funds, but not those that expand or add new provisions. The House has interpreted the rule through precedents, narrowing its application. For example, amendments that reduce the number or salary of officers are allowed, but not those that would increase them. The rule does not restrict Congress's lawmaking authority but provides a limited exception. The report also mentions the 115th Congress's separate order that reinstated parts of the rule, allowing for reductions in salaries or number of officers. However, the application is still subject to the requirement of germaneness. The House Parliamentarian is the authority on these matters.\n\nI need to structure this into a summary. Start with the main idea: the separation of policy and funding. Then explain the Holman rule, its origin, how it's been modified, and its current application.

One such circumstance allows for the inclusion of legislative language in general appropriations bills or amendments thereto for \"germane provisions that retrench expenditures by the reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill.\" This exception appears in clause 2(b) of House Rule XXI and is known as the Holman rule, after Representative William Holman of Indiana, who first proposed the exception in 1876. Since the period immediately after its initial adoption, the House has interpreted the Holman rule through precedents that have tended to incrementally narrow its application. Under current precedents, for a legislative provision or amendment to be in order, the legislative language in question must be both germane to other provisions in the measure and must produce a clear reduction of appropriations in that bill. In addition, the House adopted a separate order during the 115th Congress that provided for retrenchments of expenditures by a reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill to be construed as applying to: any provision or amendment that retrenches expenditures by— (1) the reduction of amounts of money in the bill; (2) the reduction of the number and salary of the officers of the United States; or (3) the reduction of the compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury of the United States.

Let me start by reading through the report again to get the main points. \n\nThe report starts by saying that running away from home isn't a new thing. It mentions Huckleberry Finn and Davy Crockett as examples from the past. But today's youth face more negative outcomes. They're vulnerable to high-risk behaviors, mental health issues, drug use, and sexual exploitation. Without safe shelter, they might end up in the juvenile justice system or child welfare.\n\nCongress started paying attention in the 70s, leading to the Runaway Youth Act of 1974, which became part of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act. The program has three main components: Basic Center Program (BCP), Transitional Living Program (TLP), and Street Outreach Program (SOP). These programs provide shelter, counseling, education, and support services to homeless and runaway youth. The Basic Center Program offers short-term shelter and services, Transitional Living Program offers longer-term support and assistance, and Street Outreach Program provides outreach and education services to youth at risk of exploitation and abuse.\n\nThe report discusses the challenges in defining and counting this population. Due to their mobility and reluctance to report their status, precise numbers are unknown. The McKinney-Vento Act and HUD's regulations are involved in defining homelessness for this population. The Voices of Youth Count study estimated that around 700,000 youth ages 13-17 and 3.5 million young adults ages 18-25 had experienced homelessness in the past year. \n\nThe report also highlights the factors that contribute to youth homelessness, such as family conflict, abuse, neglect, mental health issues, and substance abuse. It notes that LGBTQ+ youth are particularly at risk due to family rejection when they come out. \n\nThe report outlines the federal programs and their funding. The Basic Center Program is for short-term shelter and services, Transitional Living Program is for longer-term support, and Street Outreach Program provides outreach and education services. The Transitional Living Program is funded at 90% by the federal government. \n\nThe report also discusses the research findings, such as the high prevalence of mental health disorders, substance abuse, and sexual exploitation among homeless youth. It mentions that the Voices of Youth Count study found that LGBTQ+ young adults had more than twice the risk of being homeless compared to their heterosexual peers. \n\nThe report provides an overview of", "answers": ["This report discusses runaway and homeless youth, and the federal response to support this population. There is no single definition of the terms \"runaway youth\" or \"homeless youth.\" However, both groups of youth share the risk of not having adequate shelter and other provisions, and may engage in harmful behaviors while away from a permanent home. Youth most often cite family conflict as the major reason for their homelessness or episodes of running away. A youth's sexual orientation, sexual activity, school problems, and substance abuse are associated with family discord. The precise number of homeless and runaway youth is unknown due to their residential mobility and overlap among the populations. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is supporting data collection efforts, known as Voices of Youth Count, to better determine the number of homeless youth. The 2017 study found that approximately 700,000 youth ages 13 to 17 and 3.5 million young adults ages 18 to 25 experienced homelessness within a 12-month period because they were sleeping in places not meant for habitation, in shelters, or with others while lacking alternative living arrangements. From the early 20th century through the 1960s, the needs of runaway and homeless youth were handled locally through the child welfare agency, juvenile justice courts, or both. The 1970s marked a shift toward federal oversight of programs that help youth who had run afoul of the law, including those who committed status offenses (i.e., a noncriminal act that is considered a violation of the law because of the youth's age). The Runaway Youth Act of 1974 was enacted as Title III of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (P.L. 93-415) to assist runaways through services specifically for this population. The act was amended over time to include homeless youth. It authorizes funding for services carried out under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program (RHYP), which is administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The program was most recently authorized through FY2020 by the Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-385). This law did not make other changes to the RHYP statute. Funding is discretionary, meaning provided through the appropriations process. FY2019 appropriations are $127.4 million. The RHYP program is made up of three components: the Basic Center Program (BCP), Transitional Living Program (TLP), and Street Outreach Program (SOP). The BCP provides temporary shelter, counseling, and after care services to runaway and homeless youth under age 18 and their families. In FY2017, the program served 23,288 youth, and in FY2018 it funded 280 BCP shelters (most recent figures available). The TLP is targeted to older youth ages 16 through 22 (and sometimes an older age). In FY2017, the TLP program served 3,517 youth, and in FY2018 it funded 299 grantees (most recent figures available). Youth who use the TLP receive longer-term housing with supportive services. The SOP provides education, treatment, counseling, and referrals for runaway, homeless, and street youth who have been subjected to, or are at risk of being subjected to, sexual abuse, sex exploitation, and trafficking. In FY2017, the SOP grantees made contact with 24,366 youth. The RHYP is a part of larger federal efforts to end youth homelessness through the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH). The USICH is a coordinating body made up of multiple federal agencies committed to addressing homelessness. The USICH's Opening Doors plan to end homelessness includes strategies for ending youth homelessness by 2020, including through collecting better data and supporting evidence-based practices to improve youth outcomes. Voices of Youth Count is continuing to report on characteristics of homeless youth. In addition to the RHYP, there are other federal supports to address youth homelessness. HUD's Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program is funding a range of housing options for youth, in selected urban and rural communities.

The report is about the financial outlook for state and local governments over the next 50 years. \n\nThe main finding seems to be that there's a projected long-term deficit between revenues and expenditures. The operating balance, which measures the ability to cover current expenses with current receipts, is expected to remain negative. Both revenues and expenditures are increasing as a percentage of GDP, but expenditures are growing faster. Without policy changes, revenues won't be enough to maintain current service levels. \n\nThe report mentions a fiscal gap, which is the amount of spending reductions or revenue increases needed to close the gap. The fiscal gap is about 14.7% of total expenditures or 2.4% of GDP. This means significant action is needed to balance the budget. \n\nHealth care costs, especially Medicaid and employee benefits, are a major driver of increased spending. Medicaid spending is expected to rise faster than GDP. Employee and retiree health benefits are also growing. \n\nPension contributions are expected to increase, but the report notes that historical relationships might not hold in the future. \n\nThe simulations suggest that maintaining current policies will lead to a growing deficit. However, if policy changes are made, such as reducing benefits or increasing contributions, the fiscal gap could be closed. \n\nThere are uncertainties from federal policies, like the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and the Supreme Court decision on sales taxes. \n\nThe report also discusses the limitations of the model, such as not accounting for all aspects of fiscal health and potential heterogeneity among states and localities. \n\nI need to condense all this into one page.

Since 2007, GAO has published simulations of long-term fiscal trends in the state and local government sector, which have consistently shown that the sector faces long-term fiscal pressures. While most states have requirements related to balancing their budgets, deficits can arise because the planned annual revenues are not generated at the expected rate, demand for services exceeds planned expenditures, or both, resulting in a near-term operating deficit. This report updates GAO's state and local fiscal model to simulate the fiscal outlook for the state and local government sector. This includes identifying the components of state and local expenditures likely to contribute to the sector's fiscal pressures. In addition, this report identifies considerations related to federal policy and other factors that could contribute to uncertainties in the state and local government sector's long-term fiscal outlook. GAO's model uses the Bureau of Economic Analysis's National Income and Product Accounts as the primary data source and presents the results in the aggregate for the state and local sector as a whole. The model shows the level of receipts and expenditures for the sector until 2067, based on current and historical spending and revenue patterns. In addition, the model assumes that the current set of policies in place across state and local government remains constant to show a simulated long-term outlook. GAO's simulations suggest that the state and local government sector will likely face an increasing difference between revenues and expenditures during the next 50 years as reflected by the operating balance--a measure of the sector's ability to cover its current expenditures out of its current receipts. While both expenditures and revenues are projected to increase as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), a difference between the two is projected to persist because expenditures are expected to grow faster than revenues throughout the simulation period. GAO's simulations also suggest that growth in the sector's overall spending is largely driven by health care expenditures--in particular, Medicaid spending and spending on health benefits for state and local government employees and retirees. These expenditures are projected to grow as a share of GDP during the simulation period. GAO's simulations also suggest that revenues from personal income taxes and federal grants to states and localities will increase during the simulation period. However, revenues will grow more slowly than expenditures such that the sector faces a declining fiscal outlook. GAO also identified federal policy changes that could affect the state and local government sector's fiscal outlook. For example, the effects of the recently-enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will likely depend on how states incorporate the Act into their state income tax rules.

It mentions the need for equipment to conduct these operations, which led to the development of the ACV and MPC. The EFV program was canceled in 2011 due to cost overruns and poor performance. The MPC was considered for inland waterways but got put on hold. Then, in 2014, the Marines resurrected the MPC as ACV Increment 1.1, with plans to acquire 204 vehicles. The ACV program has faced budget issues and technical challenges, but the Marines are moving forward with the ACV 1.1 and 1.2 variants. The report also discusses the strategic vision for amphibious operations in the future, including the concept of Expeditionary Advance Base Operations (EABO). The ACV is intended to replace the AAV, which is currently used by the Marines. The report goes into detail about the requirements for the ACV and MPC, the RFI and RFP processes, the contractors involved, the testing phases, and the current status of the program.

Current Status and Future Imp", "answers": ["On January 6, 2011, after spending approximately $3 billion in developmental funding, the Marine Corps cancelled the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) program due to poor reliability demonstrated during operational testing and excessive cost growth. Because the EFV was intended to replace the 40-year-old Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAV), the Pentagon pledged to move quickly to develop a \"more affordable and sustainable\" vehicle to replace the EFV. The Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) is intended to replace the AAV, incorporating some EFV capabilities but in a more practical and cost-efficient manner. In concert with the ACV, the Marines were developing the Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC) to serve as a survivable and mobile platform to transport Marines when ashore. The MPC was not intended to be amphibious like an AAV, EFV, or the ACV but instead would be required to have a swim capability for inland waterways such as rivers, lakes, and other water obstacles such as shore-to-shore operations in the littorals. Both vehicles were intended to play central roles in future Marine amphibious operations. On June 14, 2013, Marine leadership put the MPC program \"on ice\" due to budgetary pressures but suggested the program might be resurrected some 10 years down the road when budgetary resources might be more favorable. In what was described as a \"drastic shift,\" the Marines decided to \"resurrect\" the MPC in March 2014. The Marines designated the MPC as ACV Increment 1.1 and planned to acquire about 200 vehicles. The Marines also plan to develop ACV Increment 1.2, a tracked, fully amphibious version, and at the time planned to acquire about 470 vehicles and fund an ongoing high water speed study. Although ACV Increment 1.1 is to have a swim capability, another mode of transport (ship or aircraft) would be required to get the vehicles from ship to shore. The Marines are reportedly exploring the possibility of developing a high water speed ACV 2.0, which could accompany tanks and light armored vehicles into combat. On November 5, 2014, the Marines released a draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for ACV Increment 1.1. On November 24, 2015, the Marine Corps awarded BAE Systems and SAIC contracts to develop ACV 1.1 prototypes for evaluation. BAE's contract was for $103.8 million and SAIC's for $121.5 million, and each company was to build 16 prototypes to be tested over the next two years. Both BAE and SAIC delivered their prototypes early, and Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) testing began mid-March 2017. In early December 2017, the Marines reportedly sent the ACV 1.1 down select request for proposals to BAE and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). On June 19, 2018, the Marine Corps selected BAE Systems to produce the ACV. The initial contract—valued at $198 million—was for low-rate production of 30 vehicles to be delivered by the autumn of 2019.

Matters of particular significance to U.S.-Israel relations include Israel's ability to address the threats it faces in its region. Shared U.S.-Israel concerns about Iran and its allies on the nuclear issue and in Syria and Lebanon. Israeli-Palestinian issues. Israeli domestic political issues, including elections scheduled for 2019. Israel relies on a number of strengths to manage potential threats to its security and existence. It maintains conventional military superiority relative to neighboring states and the Palestinians. It also takes measures to deter attack and defend its population and borders from evolving asymmetric threats such as rockets and missiles, cross-border tunneling, drones, and cyberattacks. Additionally, Israel has an undeclared but presumed nuclear weapons capability. Against a backdrop of strong bilateral cooperation, Israel's leaders and supporters routinely make the case that Israel's security and the broader stability of the region remain critically important for U.S. interests. A 10-year bilateral military aid memorandum of understanding (MOU)—signed in 2016—commits the United States to provide Israel $3.3 billion in Foreign Military Financing annually from FY2019 to FY2028, along with additional amounts from Defense Department accounts for missile defense. All of these amounts remain subject to congressional appropriations. Israeli officials seek to counter Iranian regional influence and prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu released new Israeli intelligence on Iran's nuclear program in April 2018, days before President Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 international agreement that constrains Iran's nuclear activities. It is unclear whether Israel might take future military action in Iran if Iranian nuclear activities resume. Since 2018, Israel has conducted a number of military operations in Syria against Iran and its allies, including Lebanese Hezbollah. Israel and Iran also appear to be competing for military advantage over each other at the Israel-Lebanon border. Amid uncertainty in the area, in March 2019 President Trump recognized Israel's claim to sovereignty over the Golan Heights, changing long-standing U.S. policy that held—in line with U.N. Security Council Resolution 497 from 1981—the Golan was occupied Syrian territory whose final status was subject to Israel-Syria negotiation. The prospects for an Israeli-Palestinian peace process are complicated by many factors. Palestinian leaders cut off high-level political contacts with the Trump Administration after it recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December 2017. U.S.-Palestinian tensions have since worsened amid U.S. cutoffs of funding to the Palestinians and diplomatic moves—including the May 2018 opening of the U.S. embassy to Israel in Jerusalem. Palestinian leaders interpreted these actions as prejudicing their claims to a capital in Jerusalem and to a just resolution of Palestinian refugee claims. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has welcomed these U.S. actions. The Trump Administration has suggested that it will release a proposed peace plan after Israeli elections, which are scheduled for April 9, 2019. Speculation continues about how warming ties between Israel and Arab Gulf states may affect Israeli-Palestinian diplomacy, though Saudi Arabia said that the U.S. policy change on the Golan Heights would negatively affect the peace process. Bouts of tension and violence between Israel and Hamas in Gaza have continued—reportedly accompanied by indirect talks between the two parties that are being brokered by Egypt and aim for a long-term cease-fire. Domestically, Israel is preparing for the April 9 elections, which are closely contested. Former top general Benny Gantz is combining with former Finance Minister Yair Lapid to challenge Netanyahu, whom the attorney general has recommended be indicted for corruption in three separate cases.

{"pred": " The Department of Defense (DOD) has established a process for setting foreign currency budget rates, which are used to estimate Operation and Maintenance (O&M) and Military Personnel (MILPERS) funding requirements for overseas expenditures. These rates are determined approximately 18 months before the fiscal year when obligations will be incurred and disbursements made. For example, in June 2015, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) issued guidance to the services on the foreign currency rates to use in building their fiscal year 2017 budgets. In February 2016, as part of the President’s budget, DOD submitted its proposed fiscal year 2017 budget to Congress, and began incurring obligations against appropriated amounts on October 1, 2016. DOD has used various methodologies for establishing the foreign currency budget rates. In 2005, a review found that DOD's approach for estimating its foreign currency requirements for fiscal year 2006 budget was a reasonable approach for forecasting foreign currency rates that could produce a more realistic estimate than its historical approach. In its fiscal year 2006 through 2016 budget requests, DOD used a centered weighted average model that combined both a 5-year average of exchange rates and an average of the most recently observed 12 months of exchange rates. For its fiscal year 2017 request, DOD adjusted its methodology to establish the foreign currency budget rates. Specifically, DOD calculated a 6-month average of Wall Street Journal rates published every Monday from May 25, 2015, to November 16, 2015. According to an OUSD(C) official, the 6-month average more closely represented foreign currency exchange rates experienced by the department during budget formulation, and it accounted for the strength of the U.S. Dollar, which had increased as compared with its historical 5-year average. DOD’s analysis found that the use of the 5-year historical average would have resulted in substantial gains when compared with gains expected from application of the 6-month average. More specifically, DOD projected gains of about $1 billion using the 5-year average of rates. During the fiscal year for which a budget is developed, DOD incurs obligations for its overseas O&M and MILPERS activities. These obligations are recorded using the foreign currency budget rates. DOD uses various methods for selecting foreign currency rates", "answers": ["DOD requested about $60 billion for fiscal years 2009 - 2017 to purchase goods and services overseas and reimburse service-members for costs incurred while stationed abroad. DOD uses foreign currency exchange rates to budget and pay (that is, disburse amounts) for these expenses. It also manages the FCFD account to mitigate a loss in buying power that results from foreign currency rate changes. GAO was asked to examine DOD's processes to budget for and manage foreign currency fluctuations. This report (1) describes DOD's revision of its foreign currency budget rates since 2009 and the relationship between the revised rates and projected O&M and MILPERS funding needs; (2) evaluates the extent to which DOD has taken steps to reduce costs in selecting foreign currency rates to disburse funds to liquidate O&M obligations, and determined whether opportunities exist to gain additional savings; and (3) assesses the extent to which DOD has effectively managed the FCFD account balance. GAO analyzed data on foreign currency rates, DOD financial management regulations, a non-generalizable sample of foreign currency disbursement data, and FCFD account balances. The Department of Defense (DOD) revised its foreign currency exchange rates (“budget rates”) during fiscal years 2014 through 2016 for each of the nine foreign currencies it uses to develop its Operation and Maintenance (O&M) and Military Personnel (MILPERS) budget request. These revisions decreased DOD's projected O&M and MILPERS funding needs. DOD's revision of the budget rates during these years also decreased the expected gains (that is, buying power) that would have resulted from an increase in the strength of the U.S. Dollar relative to other foreign currencies. DOD did not revise its budget rates in fiscal years 2009 through 2013. For fiscal year 2017, DOD changed its methodology for producing budget rates, resulting in rates that were more closely aligned with market rates. According to officials, that change made it unnecessary to revise the budget rates during the fiscal year. DOD has taken some steps to reduce costs in selecting foreign currency rates used to pay (that is, disburse amounts) for goods and services, but DOD has not fully determined whether opportunities exist to achieve additional savings. The Army has estimated potential savings of up to $10 million annually by using a foreign currency rate available 3 days in advance of paying for goods or services rather than a more costly rate available up to 5 days in advance. The Army has converted to the use of a 3-day advanced rate. GAO's analysis suggests that DOD could achieve cost savings if the services reviewed and consistently selected the most cost-effective foreign currency rates when paying for their goods and services. Absent a review, DOD is at risk for paying more than it would otherwise be required to conduct its transactions. DOD used the Foreign Currency Fluctuations, Defense (FCFD) account to cover losses (that is, less buying power) due to unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations in 6 of the 8 years GAO reviewed. Since 2012, DOD has maintained the FCFD account balance at the statutory limit of $970 million, largely by transferring unobligated balances before they are cancelled from certain DOD accounts into the FCFD. However, DOD has not identified the appropriate FCFD account balance needed to maintain program operations by routinely analyzing projected losses and basing any transfers into the account on those expected losses. Thus, DOD may be maintaining balances that are hundreds of millions of dollars higher than needed, and that could have been used for other purposes or returned to the Treasury Department (see figure). GAO is making four recommendations, including that DOD review opportunities to achieve cost savings by more consistently selecting the most cost-effective foreign currency rates used for the payment of goods and services, and analyze projected losses to manage the FCFD account balance. DOD generally concurred with the recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10667}

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report discusses various areas where DHS has made progress and faced challenges in managing the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Security Management Program (CFATS). The main areas covered are identifying high-risk facilities, risk assessment and prioritization, reviewing security plans, compliance inspections, and stakeholder outreach. \n\nFirst, there's the issue of underreporting facilities with ammonium nitrate. The report mentions that over 1,300 facilities reported ammonium nitrate, but there were more facilities with holdings. So, DHS worked with other agencies to improve data sharing. They found 1,000 more facilities and contacted them. They also hired a lead staff member. \n\nThen, there's the problem with the Distance of Concern. Facilities were self-reporting, but there were errors. DHS implemented a new Top-Screen in 2016, which calculates the Distance of Concern. They also identified 158 facilities that could cause the most harm. 156 submitted updated Top-Screens, and 145 had quality assurance reviews. \n\nNext, the risk assessment approach was lacking. The original method didn't consider economic consequences and didn't use threat data properly. DHS developed a new model with Sandia National Laboratories and a new tiering method called the Second Generation Risk Engine. They also conducted peer reviews and technical reviews. The GAO is still reviewing the results of these changes and will report later this summer.\n\nThen, there's the Expedited Approval Program (EAP). It's an option for tier 3 and 4 facilities to submit security plans. However, only 18 out of 3,152 eligible facilities used it. The reasons given are that most had already submitted standard plans, the EAP measures are too strict, and the lack of an authorization inspection. Also, the revised risk assessment methodology might affect future EAP participation. \n\nAlso, the report talks about compliance inspections. They found that many facilities weren't compliant with their security plans. DHS didn't have documented processes for managing non-compliance. They updated their enforcement SOP and are working on a new inspections SOP, expected by end of 2018. \n\nIn terms of stakeholder outreach, DHS started using a questionnaire", "answers": ["Thousands of facilities have hazardous chemicals that could be targeted or used to inflict mass casualties or harm surrounding populations in the United States. In accordance with the DHS Appropriations Act, 2007, DHS established the CFATS program in 2007 to, among other things, identify and assess the security risk posed by chemical facilities. DHS inspects high-risk facilities after it approves facility security plans to ensure that the facilities are implementing required security measures and procedures. This statement summarizes progress and challenges related to DHS's CFATS program management. This statement is based on prior products GAO issued from July 2012 through June 2017, along with updates conducted in June 2018 on DHS actions to address prior GAO recommendations. To conduct the prior work, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and DHS policies for administering the CFATS program, how DHS assesses risk, and data on high-risk chemical facilities. GAO also interviewed DHS officials and reviewed information on DHS actions to implement its prior recommendations. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has made progress addressing challenges that GAO's past work identified to managing the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program. The following summarizes progress made and challenges remaining in key aspects of the program. Identifying high-risk chemical facilities. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS used self-reported and unverified data to determine the risk of facilities holding toxic chemicals that could threaten surrounding communities if released. GAO recommended that DHS should better verify the accuracy of facility-reported data. DHS implemented this recommendation by revising its methodology so it now calculates the risk of toxic release, rather than relying on facilities to do so. Assessing risk and prioritizing facilities. In April 2013, GAO reported weaknesses in multiple aspects of DHS's risk assessment and prioritization approach. GAO made two recommendations for DHS to review and improve this process, including that DHS enhance its risk assessment approach to incorporate all of the elements of consequence, threat, and vulnerability associated with a terrorist attack involving certain chemicals. DHS launched a new risk assessment methodology in October 2016 and is currently gathering new or updated data from about 27,000 facilities to (1) determine which facilities should be categorized as high-risk because of the threat of sabotage, theft or diversion, or a toxic release and (2) assign those facilities deemed high risk to one of four risk-based tiers. GAO has ongoing work assessing these efforts and will report later this summer on the extent to which they fully address prior recommendations. Reviewing and approving facilities' site security plans . DHS is to review security plans and visit facilities to ensure their security measures meet DHS standards. In April 2013, GAO reported a 7 to 9 year backlog for these reviews and visits. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS had made substantial progress in addressing the backlog—estimating that it could take between 9 and 12 months for DHS to review and approve security plans for the approximately 900 remaining facilities. DHS has since taken additional action to expedite these activities and has eliminated this backlog. Inspecting facilities and ensuring compliance. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS conducted compliance inspections at 83 of the 1,727 facilities with approved security plans. GAO found that nearly half of the inspected facilities were not fully compliant with their approved security plans and that DHS did not have documented procedures for managing facilities' compliance. GAO recommended that DHS document procedures for managing compliance. As a result, DHS has developed an enforcement procedure and a draft compliance inspection procedure and expects to finalize the compliance inspection procedure by the end of fiscal year 2018. GAO has made various recommendations to strengthen DHS's management of the CFATS program, with which DHS has generally agreed. DHS has implemented or described planned actions to address most of these recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2363}
{"pred": " The report provides an overview of coal production, mining methods, and regulatory frameworks in the United States, focusing on the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) and its implementation by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE). In 2016, coal accounted for 17 percent of energy production and 30 percent of electricity generation in the U.S. Approximately 730 million tons of coal were mined domestically, with 40 percent coming from federal lands. Coal is extracted through surface mining, which involves clearing land and removing topsoil, or underground mining, which requires tunnels to access deeper coal deposits. Both methods have environmental impacts, including land disturbance and water quality degradation, such as acid mine drainage and sedimentation in water bodies. The SMCRA mandates that operators obtain permits before mining, with plans for reclamation and financial assurances to ensure reclamation. The act also established the OSMRE to administer the act. SMCRA allows states and Indian tribes to develop their own programs to implement the act if the Secretary of the Interior finds that the program is in accordance with federal law. States with approved programs are said to have \"primacy\" for that program. To obtain primacy, a state or Indian tribe must submit to the Secretary of the Interior for approval a program that demonstrates the state or tribe has the capability to carry out the requirements of SMCRA. The program must demonstrate that the state or tribe has a law that provides for the regulation of the surface effects of coal mining and reclamation in accordance with the requirements of SMCRA, and a regulatory authority with sufficient personnel and funding to do so. The report highlights the importance of financial assurances in ensuring that reclamation is completed. The report also discusses the challenges faced by OSMRE and state regulatory authorities in managing financial assurances for coal mine reclamation, including the complexities of self-bonding, unanticipated reclamation costs, and the financial stability of surety companies. The report concludes that Congress should consider amending SMCRA to eliminate the use of self-bonding as a type of financial assurance for coal mine reclamation.\n\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points. \n\nThe report is about coal production in the U.S. in 2016. It mentions that coal was 17% of energy production and 30% of electricity. They mined", "answers": ["Coal accounts for 17 percent of domestic energy production. SMCRA requires coal mine operators to reclaim lands that were disturbed during mining and to submit a financial assurance in an amount sufficient to ensure that adequate funds will be available to complete reclamation if the operator does not do so. Recent coal company bankruptcies have drawn attention to whether financial assurances obtained by OSMRE and state agencies will be adequate to reclaim land once coal mining operations have ceased. GAO was asked to review management of financial assurances for coal mine reclamation. This report describes, among other things, the amounts and types of financial assurances held for coal mine reclamation in 2017 and the challenges that OSMRE and state agencies face in managing these financial assurances. GAO collected and analyzed data from OSMRE and 23 state agencies; reviewed federal laws, regulations, and directives; and interviewed OSMRE and state agency officials and representatives from organizations associated with the mining and financial assurance industries and environmental organizations. State agencies and the Department of the Interior's Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) reported holding approximately $10.2 billion in surety bonds (guaranteed by a third party), collateral bonds (guaranteed by a tangible asset, such as a certificate of deposit), and self-bonds (guaranteed on the basis of a coal operator's own finances) as financial assurances for coal mine reclamation. OSMRE and state agencies face several challenges in managing financial assurances, according to the stakeholders GAO interviewed. Specifically, Obtaining additional financial assurances from operators for unanticipated reclamation costs, such as long-term treatment for water pollution, can be difficult. Determining the financial stability of surety companies has been challenging in certain instances. Self-bonding presents a risk to the government because it is difficult to (1) ascertain the financial health of an operator, (2) determine whether the operator qualifies for self-bonding, and (3) obtain a replacement for existing self-bonds when an operator no longer qualifies. In addition, some stakeholders said that the risk from self-bonding is greater now than when the practice was first authorized under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA). GAO's previous work examining environmental cleanup found that the financial risk to government and the amount of oversight needed for self-bonds are relatively high compared to other forms of financial assurances. GAO also previously reviewed federal financial assurance requirements for various energy and mineral extraction sectors and found that coal mining is the only one where self-bonding was allowed. However, because SMCRA explicitly allows states to decide whether to accept self-bonds, eliminating the risk that self-bonds pose to the federal government and states would require SMCRA be amended. GAO recommends that Congress consider amending SMCRA to eliminate self-bonding. Interior neither agreed nor disagreed with GAO's recommendation."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6217}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. \n\nThe report talks about how federal agencies are funded annually through regular appropriations acts. If those acts are delayed, a continuing resolution (CR) is used to provide interim funding. The fiscal year started on October 1 in 1977, and there were only four instances where regular appropriations acts were not enacted by the start of the fiscal year. However, in one of those years, a CR wasn't needed. The Antideficiency Act prohibits spending without appropriations. When there's a funding gap (no appropriations or CR), agencies may have to shut down. \n\nThere's mention of the Civiletti letters from 1980 and 1981, which clarify that during a funding gap, agencies can't make new contracts or obligations, except for certain exceptions. These exceptions include activities related to the safety of human life or the protection of property. \n\nThe report also discusses funding gaps since FY1977, noting that there have been 20 such gaps. The duration varies from 1 to 34 days. Some gaps resulted in government shutdowns, while others had minimal impact. For example, the 1996 funding gaps led to widespread shutdowns, whereas some recent gaps had limited effects. \n\nThe most recent funding gap was in FY2019, which lasted 34 days. The report includes legislative history of these gaps, such as the 1996 funding gaps, the 2014, 2018, and 2019 gaps. \n\nThe report also mentions proposals for an automatic continuing resolution (ACR) to prevent funding gaps, but none have been enacted. \n\nSo, the summary needs to cover the funding process, the role of CRs, the Antideficiency Act, the concept of funding gaps, the Civiletti letters, the impact of these gaps (shutdowns, furloughs), the number and duration of gaps, and the legislative history. Also, the mention of the ACR proposal and its lack of enactment. \n\nI need to structure this into a coherent one-page summary. Start with an introduction about the funding process. Then explain CRs and the Antideficiency Act. Then discuss the Civiletti letters and their implications. Then talk about the frequency and duration of funding gaps, noting the most", "answers": ["The Antideficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341-1342, 1511-1519) generally bars the obligation of funds in the absence of appropriations. Exceptions are made under the act, including for activities involving \"the safety of human life or the protection of property.\" The interval during the fiscal year when appropriations for a particular project or activity are not enacted into law, either in the form of a regular appropriations act or a continuing resolution (CR), is referred to as a funding gap or funding lapse. Although funding gaps may occur at the start of the fiscal year, they may also occur any time a CR expires and another CR (or the regular appropriations bill) is not enacted immediately thereafter. Multiple funding gaps may occur within a fiscal year. When a funding gap occurs, federal agencies are generally required to begin a shutdown of the affected projects and activities, which includes the prompt furlough of non-excepted personnel. The general practice of the federal government after the shutdown has ended has been to retroactively pay furloughed employees for the time they missed, as well as employees who were required to come to work. Although a shutdown may be the result of a funding gap, the two events should be distinguished. This is because a funding gap may result in a total shutdown of all affected projects or activities in some instances but not others. For example, when funding gaps are of a short duration, agencies may not have enough time to complete a shutdown of affected projects and activities before funding is restored. In addition, the Office of Management and Budget has previously indicated that a shutdown of agency operations within the first day of the funding gap may be postponed if a resolution appears to be imminent. Since FY1977, 20 funding gaps occurred, ranging in duration from 1 day to 34 full days. These funding gaps are listed in Table 1. About half of these funding gaps were brief (i.e., three days or less in duration). Notably, many of the funding gaps do not appear to have resulted in a \"shutdown.\" Prior to the issuance of the opinions in 1980 and early 1981 by then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti, while agencies tended to curtail some operations in response to a funding gap, they often \"continued to operate during periods of expired funding.\" In addition, some of the funding gaps after the Civiletti opinions did not result in a completion of shutdown operations due to both the funding gap's short duration and an expectation that appropriations would soon be enacted. Some of the funding gaps during this period, however, did have a broader impact on affected government operations, even if only for a matter of hours. Two funding gaps occurred in FY1996, amounting to 5 days and 21 days. The chronology of regular and continuing appropriations enacted during FY1996 is illustrated in Figure 1. At the beginning of FY2014 (October 1, 2013), none of the regular appropriations bills had been enacted, so a government-wide funding gap occurred. It concluded on October 17, 2013, after lasting 16 full days. During FY2018, there was a funding gap when a CR covering all of the regular appropriations bills expired on January 19, 2018. It concluded on January 22, 2018, after lasting two full days. The most recent funding gap occurred during FY2019, when a CR covering federal agencies and activities funded in 7 of the 12 regular appropriations bills expired on December 21, 2018. It concluded on January 25, 2019, after lasting 34 full days.

{"pred": " The Department of Defense (DOD) manages its document services through three primary categories: printing and reproduction, device procurement, and electronic content management. Printing and reproduction involves high-speed, high-volume production and distribution, often handled by DLA Document Services or other vendors. Device procurement includes office-level and production-level equipment, such as printers, copiers, and multi-function devices. Electronic content management involves digitizing documents and managing systems like databases and automation services. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment oversees policies and programs for document services, and DLA Document Services is the designated single manager for printing and high-speed duplication. However, the DOD is revising its instruction on document services, and the role of DLA as the single manager is under consideration for changes. The report highlights that while DOD has made progress in reducing costs and increasing efficiency, there are still areas where further improvements can be made. These include better managing the fragmentation in printing and reproduction services, reducing overlap in procuring print devices, meeting the goals to reduce the number of print devices, and consolidating locations that provide mission specialty printing. The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is in the process of revising its instruction on document services, and the role of DLA as the single manager is under consideration for changes. The report also discusses the financial information provided by DOD, noting that while some data is available, it does not fully capture the scope of its document services mission. The DLA Document Services is undergoing a transformation plan to increase efficiencies and better accomplish its mission of providing document services to DOD and the military services. The plan includes closing or consolidating 74 of its 12 facilities in the continental United States over the course of fiscal years 2018 and 2019, bringing its footprint to 38 facilities. The transformation plan also includes adjusting the size and composition of the workforce by the plan’s completion in fiscal year 2019.

DLA Document Services is the", "answers": ["DOD has reported printing costs that totaled about $608 million, on average, during fiscal years 2010 through 2015. DLA Document Services has key DOD-wide responsibilities for (1) printing and reproduction, (2) print device procurement, and (3) electronic content management (e.g., digital document repositories). Other DOD components, including the military services, also maintain some document services capabilities at various locations. House Report 115-200 accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018 included a provision for GAO to examine DOD's document services. This report evaluates (1) the progress DOD has made in achieving efficiencies in its document services and opportunities, if any, to achieve further efficiencies, and (2) the extent to which DOD reports accurate financial information about its document services to key stakeholders. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials regarding DOD's efficiency initiatives, including DLA Document Services' transformation plan; reviewed print device procurement contracts and pricing information; and analyzed DOD budget data for fiscal years 2012 through 2016. The Department of Defense (DOD) has taken steps to achieve efficiencies in its document services, including implementing a transformation plan to consolidate existing Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Document Services facilities. However, GAO identified four areas where further gains may be possible: Managing fragmentation in printing and reproduction services. DOD has designated DLA Document Services as the single manager for printing and reproduction services, but DOD customers, citing concerns with DLA's services, have also obtained these services directly from the Government Publishing Office and via in-house print facilities (see fig.). DOD has not assessed DLA's performance in this role or whether additional efficiencies may be possible in light of DLA's transformation plan. Reducing overlap in procuring print devices. GAO found that DOD components used at least four different contract sources to acquire print devices. DOD has not assessed which acquisition approach represents the best value; doing so might better position DOD to further reduce its costs. Meeting goals to reduce the number of print devices. DOD and the military services have not demonstrated that they achieved established goals for reducing the number of print devices.

DOD includes the cost of non-printing activities, such as the purchase of advertising time for recruiting, within its budget materials for printing and reproduction. It does not include costs to acquire print devices and for electronic content management.

{"pred": " The federal government manages a vast network of buildings, costing billions annually to operate and maintain. To address inefficiencies, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the General Services Administration (GSA) have implemented initiatives and policies, including the Reduce the Footprint (RTF) policy, to improve real property management. The RTF policy requires agencies to submit annual Real Property Efficiency Plans (Plans) to GSA and OMB, set design standards, and establish annual reduction targets for a five-year period. The RTF policy aims to increase efficiency, control costs, and reduce federal real property. The report outlines the approaches and challenges faced by 24 CFO Act agencies in achieving their RTF reduction targets. The main approaches include consolidation of operations into fewer buildings, co-location of staff across agencies, disposal of unneeded properties, better utilization of existing space, and telework/hoteling. Agencies reported using consolidation projects, co-location initiatives, and property disposal as primary methods to reduce office space. Other methods included telework and reducing space allocated per person. The report also highlights the challenges agencies encountered, such as the costs of reducing space, mission delivery requirements, employee organization concerns, and workload growth. The report concludes that while agencies faced various challenges, they generally achieved reductions in their office and warehouse space, and the RTF policy is a significant step toward more efficient federal real property management.\n\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points. \n\nThe report talks about the federal government owning and leasing a lot of buildings, which cost billions each year. They've been trying to improve how they manage these properties. OMB and GSA are the main agencies involved. There's this RTF policy that came from a 2012 memo, then a 2013 clarification, and then in 2015 they shifted from freezing to reducing the footprint. The National Strategy outlines three steps: freeze growth, measure performance, and reduce inventory. The RTF policy requires agencies to submit annual Real Property Efficiency Plans, set design standards, and establish annual reduction targets for five years. \n\nThe agencies used strategies like consolidation, co-location, disposal, better space utilization, and telework/hoteling. Examples include HUD consolidating into a single building, USDA consolidation, and Interior's consolidation. Co-location examples are SSA and IRS, and USGS and NASA. Disposal examples include IRS processing centers. \n\nCh", "answers": ["The federal government continues to work to reduce its real property inventory and associated costs. GSA provides space for agencies in government-owned and commercially leased buildings. In 2015, the OMB issued a memorandum requiring the 24 agencies with chief financial officers to reduce their domestic office and warehouse space. These agencies are required to set annual reduction targets for a 5-year time period and update their real property plans annually. GAO was asked to review the implementation of this space reduction initiative. This report discusses: (1) the approaches and any challenges the 24 agencies identified to achieving their reduction targets for all their domestic office and warehouse space; (2) the extent these agencies reduced their space and met their fiscal year 2016 targets; and (3) how GSA manages vacated space it had leased to these agencies. GAO conducted a content analysis of the 24 agencies' real property plans for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 and analyzed agencies' data as submitted to GSA on their targets and reductions for fiscal year 2016, the only year for which data were available. GAO selected five agencies as case studies based on several factors, including size of the agencies' office and warehouse portfolio, agency reduction targets, and fiscal year 2016 reported reductions. GAO reviewed relevant documentation and interviewed officials from GSA, OMB, and GAO's case study agencies. GAO provided a draft of this product to GSA, OMB, and our case study agencies for comment. GAO incorporated technical comments, as appropriate. Most of the 24 agencies with chief financial officers reported to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the General Services Administration (GSA) that they planned to consolidate their office and warehouse space and allocate fewer square feet per employee as the key ways to achieve their space reduction targets. For example, the Department of Agriculture reported it will consolidate staff from five component agencies in two office buildings. When complete, the space allocated per employee will average about 250 square feet down from a high of 420 square feet per employee. In taking these actions, the agencies most often identified the cost of space reduction projects as a challenge to achieving their targets. Agencies cited costs such as for space renovations to accommodate more staff and required environmental clean-up before disposing of property as challenges to completing projects. Some agencies required to maintain offices across the country reported that their mission requirements limit their ability to reduce their space. In fiscal year 2016, 17 of the 24 agencies reported they reduced their space, but had varying success achieving their first-year targets. Of the 17 agencies, 9 exceeded their target and reduced more space than planned, 7 missed their target (by anywhere between 2.8 and 96.7 percent), and 1 reduced space, despite a targeted increase. Agency officials said that it is not unusual for projects to shift to different years and that such shifts could lead to missing targets one year and exceeding them the next. GSA has processes to manage the space vacated by agencies that is leased through GSA. For example, starting in November 2016, GSA started tracking agencies' space release requests centrally to help standardize the process and established an e-mail address to which agencies can submit requests. GSA relies on regional offices to manage real property in their regions and to identify tenants for vacant space or to remove unused space from the inventory. GSA's regional officials said regular monitoring and coordinating with agencies minimizes the likelihood GSA is caught off guard by a return of space. These processes also help them to plan ahead. GSA met its 2016 performance goal to have an annual vacant space rate of no more than 3.2 percent in its federally owned and leased buildings. However, given the recent implementation of the space reduction initiative, it is too early to determine the extent to which agencies will return space to GSA prior to the end of their leases and the effect on GSA's inventory."], "all_classes": null, "length": 7578}

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the main points. The report is about the decline of cash as a payment method and the rise of electronic payments. It mentions technological advances making electronic payments more convenient and cost-effective. Established methods like credit and debit cards are popular, and new methods like Venmo and Square are becoming more available. There's also mention of cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currencies.\n\nThe report starts by talking about how electronic payments have become more prevalent due to technology. It notes that cash is still important in the US, but some businesses are choosing not to accept it. In countries like Sweden, cash is becoming scarce. The report also mentions that some central banks are considering issuing their own digital currencies. These trends suggest that cash's role may continue to decline, perhaps significantly, in the future.\n\nThen there's a discussion about the potential benefits and risks of a cashless society. Supporters argue that it would improve payment efficiency, reduce crime, and enhance monetary policy effectiveness. They believe that cash is anonymous and can be used for illegal activities, so reducing its use could have positive effects. However, opponents point out that cash is a safe asset for people who are not in the financial system, and that reducing cash could lead to more cyberattacks and privacy issues. They also mention that financially vulnerable groups might be marginalized if cash is no longer accepted.\n\nThe report is divided into two parts. Part I analyzes cash and noncash payment systems, including traditional methods and alternative systems like cryptocurrencies. Part II discusses the potential implications of reduced cash usage, including both benefits and drawbacks.\n\nIn Part I, the report describes the characteristics of cash and various electronic payment systems. It discusses the advantages and costs of each system, and the obstacles to adopting alternative electronic payment systems. For example, cash is a simple, robust payment method that requires no ancillary technology. However, electronic payments can be vulnerable to cyberattacks and data breaches. \n\nThe report also includes case studies of Sweden and Kenya. In Sweden, cash usage has dropped significantly, and businesses are increasingly not accepting it. In Kenya, mobile money services like M-Pesa have expanded, providing access to financial services for those without traditional banking.\n\nOkay, so the summary needs to capture the key points: the shift from cash to electronic payments, the reasons (technology, convenience, cost), the emergence of new payment", "answers": ["Electronic forms of payment have become increasingly available, convenient, and cost efficient due to technological advances in digitization and data processing. Anecdotal reporting and certain analyses suggest that businesses and consumers are increasingly eschewing cash payments in favor of electronic payment methods. Such trends have led analysts and policymakers to examine the possibility that the use and acceptance of cash will significantly decline in coming years and to consider the effects of such an evolution. Cash is still a common and widely accepted payment system in the United States. Cash's advantages include its simplicity and robustness as a payment system that requires no ancillary technologies. In addition, it provides privacy in transactions and protection from cyber threats or financial institution failures. However, using cash involves costs to businesses and consumers who pay fees to obtain, manage, and protect cash and exposes its users to loss through misplacement, theft, or accidental destruction of physical currency. Cash also concurrently generates government revenues through \"profits\" earned by producing it and by acting as interest-free liabilities to the Federal Reserve (in contrast to reserve balances on which the Federal Reserve pays interest), while reducing government revenues by facilitating some tax avoidance. The relative advantages and costs of various payment methods will largely determine whether and to what degree electronic payment systems will displace cash. Traditional noncash payment systems (such as credit and debit cards and interbank clearing systems) involving intermediaries such as banks and central banks address some of the shortcomings of cash payments. These systems can execute payments over physical distance, allow businesses and consumers to avoid some of the costs and risks of using cash, and are run by generally trusted and closely regulated intermediaries. However, the maintenance and operation of legacy noncash systems involve their own costs, and the intermediaries charge fees to recoup those costs and earn profits. The time it takes to finalize certain transactions—including crediting customer accounts for check or electronic deposits—can lead to consumers incurring additional costs. In addition, these systems involve cybersecurity risks and generally require customers to divulge their private personal information to gain system access, which raises privacy concerns. To date, the migration away from cash has largely been in favor of traditional noncash payment systems; however, some observers predict new alternative systems will play a larger role in the future. Such alternative systems aim to address some of the inefficiencies and risks of traditional noncash systems, but face obstacles to achieving that aim and involve costs of their own. Private systems using distributed ledger technology, such as cryptocurrencies, may not serve the main functions of money well and face challenges to widespread acceptance and technological scalability. These systems also raise concerns among certain observers related to whether these systems could facilitate crime, provide inadequate protections to consumers, and may adversely affect governments' ability to implement or transmit monetary policy. The potential for increased payment efficiency from these systems is promising enough that certain central banks have investigated the possibility of issuing government-backed, electronic-only currencies—called central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)—in such a way that the benefits of certain alternative payment systems could be realized with appropriately mitigated risk. How CBDCs would be created and function are still matters of speculation at this time, and the possibility of their introduction raises questions about the appropriate role of a central bank in the financial system and the economy. If the relative benefits and costs of cash and the various other payment methods evolve in such a way that cash is significantly displaced as a commonly accepted form of payment, that evolution could have a number of effects, both positive and negative, on the economy and society. Proponents of reducing cash usage (or even eliminating it all together and becoming a cashless society) argue that doing so will generate important benefits, including potentially improved efficiency of the payment system, a reduction of crime, and less constrained monetary policy. Proponents of maintaining cash as a payment option argue that significant reductions in cash usage and acceptance would further marginalize people with limited access to the financial system, increase the financial system's vulnerability to cyberattack, and reduce personal privacy. Based on their assessment of the magnitude of these benefits and costs and the likelihood that market forces will displace cash as a payment system, policymakers may choose to encourage or discourage this trend."], "all_classes": null, "length": 9601}
{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about the federal government's Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs). Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report explains that the Department of Energy operates four PMAs: BPA, SEPA, SWPA, and WAPA. These were created to manage electric power from federal dams, which were built for irrigation, flood control, etc. The PMAs are responsible for selling this power, with a focus on serving smaller communities and farms that private utilities wouldn't serve. They have to prioritize public utility districts and cooperatives, selling at cost-based rates. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates these rates to ensure repayment of federal facility costs. Since FY2011, PMA revenues are classified as discretionary offsetting receipts, so the agencies have a \"net-zero\" spending authority. Only WAPA and SWPA require appropriations from Congress. Each PMA has unique regional issues.\n\nThe BPA is the first PMA, created in 1237, serving the Pacific Northwest. It's self-financed, with no federal appropriations. It has a large transmission system, and markets power from 31 federal dams. It has a significant amount of debt, and is looking at ways to manage it. They have issues with renewable energy sources like wind and solar affecting their competitiveness. Also, there's the issue with the dams and salmon populations, leading to legal challenges. The Trump administration proposed selling the transmission assets, but it was dropped due to opposition. Congress has laws preventing executive actions on PMAs.\n\nSo, the summary needs to cover the creation of the PMAs, their purpose, how they operate (rates, preference customers), the role of FERC, the financial aspects (discretionary receipts, capital expenses), the unique aspects of each PMA, the issues they face (like environmental concerns, renewable energy integration, debt management), and the recent proposal to privatize or sell the assets, which was opposed.\n\nI need to structure this into a coherent one-page summary. Let me outline the main sections:\n\n1. Introduction: What are PMAs, their purpose, and creation.\n2. Structure and Operations: How they function, including rate setting, preference customers, FERC's role.\n3. Financial Aspects: Discretionary receipts, capital expenses, debt management.\n4. Unique Issues per", "answers": ["The federal government, through the Department of Energy, operates four regional power marketing administrations (PMAs), created by statute: the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), the Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA), the Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA), and the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA). Each PMA operates in a distinct geographic area. Congressional interest in the PMAs has included diverse issues such as rate setting, cost and compliance associated with the Endangered Species Act (ESA; P.L. 93-205; 16 U.S.C. §§1531 et seq.), and questions of privatization of these federal agencies. In general, the PMAs came into being because of the government's need to dispose of electric power produced by dams constructed largely for irrigation, flood control, or other purposes, and to achieve small community and farm electrification—that is, providing service to customers whom it would not have been profitable for a private utility to serve. With minor exceptions, these agencies market the electric power produced by federal dams constructed, owned, and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) and the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR). By statute, PMAs must give preference to public utility districts and cooperatives (e.g., \"preference customers\"), and sell their power at cost-based rates set at the lowest possible rate consistent with sound business principles. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates PMA rates to ensure that they are set high enough to repay the U.S. Treasury for the portion of federal facility costs allocated to hydropower beneficiaries. With energy and capacity markets changing in the western United States (especially with the growing need to integrate increasing amounts of variable renewable sources), and the development of the Energy Imbalance Market in the West, BPA and WAPA may have to adapt their plans with regard to generation needs and how transmission systems are developed. In 2018, the Trump Administration proposed to sell the transmission assets (lines, towers, substations, and/or rights of way) owned and operated by the federal Power Marketing Administrations. The proposal suggested that \"eliminating or reducing\" the federal government's role in owning and operating transmission assets, and increasing the private sector's role, would \"encourage a more efficient allocation of economic resources and mitigate unnecessary risk to taxpayers.\" The resulting PMA entities would then contract with other utilities to provide transmission services for the delivery of federal power, similar to what SEPA does currently. Reportedly, the proposed sale of PMA assets was dropped after opposition to the plan emerged from stakeholders. Under Section 208 of the Urgent Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1986 (P.L. 99-349), the executive branch is prohibited from spending funds to study or draft proposals to transfer from federal control any portion of the assets of the PMAs unless specifically authorized by Congress. Environmental, fishing, and tribal advocates have sued the federal government over concerns that operating rules for hydropower dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers (i.e., the National Marine Fisheries Service Biological Opinion) are inadequate to ensure survival of species threatened or endangered under the ESA. In 2016, a federal judge overturned a previous management plan for the dams, finding that it would not be sufficient to protect salmon runs, and ordered a new management plan that could include removing the dams. However, in 2018, President Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum accelerating the process for a new management plan, requiring the biological opinion to be ready by 2020. Since FY2011, power revenues associated with the PMAs have been classified as discretionary offsetting receipts (i.e., receipts that are available for spending by the PMAs), thus the agencies are sometimes noted as having a \"net-zero\" spending authority.

The main challenge for the minority leader is the subordinate status of their party in an institution that favors majority rule. There's a quote from David Bonior about the House operating under the principle that a determined majority should be allowed to work its will while protecting the rights of the minority to be heard. The minority party members are certain to be heard, but whether they will be heeded is another matter. So the main goal is to recapture majority control.\n\nThe minority leader is elected every two years by secret ballot in their party caucus. They are usually experienced lawmakers. The current one is Kevin McCarthy, R-CA, who had 12 years in the House, including as majority leader. Speaker Pelosi had 16 years when she first became minority leader in 2003-2004, then again in 2011-2012 after her first term as Speaker. The report then goes into the history of the position, explaining that it's a 19th-century innovation. Before that, congressional parties were disorganized, so it wasn't clear who was the opposition floor leader. The report mentions that the position became more formalized in the late 19th century, with the establishment of more specialized roles within the House. It also talks about the responsibilities of the minority leader, both in terms of party duties and institutional roles. The report also discusses various strategies that minority leaders can use to advance their party's agenda, such as cooperation, opposition, withdrawal, innovation, and partisan opposition. There's a mention of how the minority leader might use obstruction tactics to delay the majority's agenda, thereby creating a narrative of a \"do-nothing Congress\" to gain public support for their party.

{"pred": " Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is a federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in educational programs and activities that receive federal funding. Title IX does not explicitly mention sexual abuse or harassment, but the Supreme Court has interpreted Title IX to require schools to respond to allegations of sexual harassment. The Court has held that a school district can be held liable for damages based on a deliberately indifferent response to a teacher's sexual abuse or harassment of a student. The Court has also held that a school board may be liable under Title IX for a deliberately indifferent response to student-on-student sexual harassment. Title IX is primarily enforced in two ways: (1) through private rights of action directly against schools by or on behalf of students subject to such harassment in certain circumstances; and (2) by federal agencies that provide funding to educational programs. The first enforcement method involves private rights of action where students can seek damages for sexual harassment or abuse. The second enforcement method involves federal agencies that provide funding to educational programs. Title IX applies to all educational institutions that receive federal funding, including public schools and most higher education institutions. The text of Title IX does not mention sexual abuse or harassment, but current regulations implementing the statute do not explicitly address sexual harassment. In each of the last several presidential administrations, the Department of Education (ED) has issued guidance documents that instruct schools regarding their responsibilities under Title IX when addressing allegations of sexual harassment. In response to the foregoing guidance from ED, as well as increased oversight from OCR between 2011 and 2016, schools developed a variety of procedures to ensure that their responses to allegations of sexual harassment complied with Title IX.

It bars discrimination \"on the basis of sex\" in an educational program or activity receiving federal funding. Although Title IX makes no explicit reference to sexual harassment or abuse, the Supreme Court and federal agencies have determined that such conduct can sometimes constitute discrimination in violation of the statute; educational institutions in some circumstances can be held responsible when a teacher sexually harasses a student or when one student harasses another. Title IX is mainly enforced (1) through private rights of action brought directly against schools by or on behalf of students subjected to sexual misconduct; and (2) by federal agencies that provide funding to educational programs. To establish liability in a private right of action, a party seeking damages for a Title IX violation must satisfy the standards set forth by the Supreme Court in Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District, decided in 1998, and Davis Next Friend LaShonda D. v. Monroe County Board of Education, decided the next year. Gebser provides that when a teacher commits harassment against a student, a school district is liable only when it has actual knowledge of allegations by an \"appropriate person,\" and so deficiently responds to those allegations that its response amounts to deliberate indifference to the discrimination. Davis instructs that, besides showing actual knowledge by an appropriate person and deliberate indifference, a plaintiff suing for damages for sexual harassment committed by a student must show that the conduct was \"so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive\" that it denied the victim equal access to educational opportunities or benefits. Taken together, the Supreme Court's decisions set forth a high threshold for a private party seeking damages against an educational institution based on its response to sexual harassment. In turn, federal appellate courts have differed in how to apply the standards set in Gebser and Davis, diverging on the nature and amount of evidence sufficient to support a claim. In each of the last several presidential administrations, the Department of Education (ED) issued a number of guidance documents that instruct schools on their responsibilities under Title IX when addressing allegations of sexual harassment. These documents—while sometimes subject to change—generally reflected a different standard than the Supreme Court case law addressing private rights of action for damages for sexual abuse or harassment (the Court in Davis acknowledged that the threshold for liability in a private right of action could be higher than the standard imposed in the administrative enforcement context). Those guidance documents had, among other things, established that sometimes a school could be held responsible for instances of sexual harassment by a teacher, irrespective of actual notice; and schools could be held responsible for student-on-student harassment if a \"responsible employee\" knew or should have known of the harassment (constructive notice). ED's previous guidance also instructed educational institutions that they sometimes could be responsible for responding to incidents of sexual harassment occurring off campus. ED also cautioned schools on the use of mediation to resolve allegations of sexual harassment. With regard to the procedures used by schools to resolve sexual harassment allegations, ED informed schools that they must use the preponderance of the evidence standard to establish culpability, and the agency strongly discouraged schools from allowing parties in a hearing to personally cross-examine one another. In response to guidance from ED, as well as increased oversight from the department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) between 2011 and 2016, schools developed several procedures to ensure that their responses to allegations of sexual harassment and assault complied with Title IX. A number of students faced with disciplinary action by public universities raised constitutional challenges to the Title IX procedures used to find them responsible for sexual misconduct, arguing that universities violated the Due Process Clause in handling their case. ED issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in late 2018, after revoking some of its previous guidance to schools in 2017. The proposed regulations would, in several ways, tether the administrative requirements for schools to the standard set by the Supreme Court in Gebser and Davis. In doing so, the proposed regulations would depart from the standards set by ED in previous guidance documents (some of which have since been rescinded). The new regulations would require \"actual notice,\" rather than constructive notice, of harassment by an education institution to trigger a school's Title IX responsibilities, and provide that a school's response to allegations of sexual harassment will violate Title IX only if it amounts to deliberate indifference.

{"pred": " The National Science Foundation (NSF) utilizes two primary programs to bring in rotating staff: the Independent Program (IPA) and the Visiting Scientist Exchange Exchange (VSEE) program. These programs differ in key aspects, including employment status and compensation. IPA rotators are employed by their home institutions, with NSF reimbursing its cost-sharing amounts to home institutions, which continue to pay rotators’ full salaries and benefits. NSF does not cap the salaries of IPA rotators, allowing them to receive salaries that exceed the maximum federal salary for the position they hold at NSF. In contrast, if an IPA rotator’s salary is less than the minimum federal salary for the position, NSF will supplement the salary to the minimum rate. VSEE rotators are appointed as federal employees on nonpaid leave from their home institutions. VSEE rotators receive their salaries directly from NSF but are not eligible for certain federal benefits, such as retirement. NSF reimburses home institutions for the employer's share of retirement, life insurance, and health benefits that would otherwise be discontinued. NSF’s policy is to set salaries for VSEE rotators that are generally comparable to the salaries the rotators would receive at their home institutions. In setting salaries, NSF also takes into account other sources of income, such as consulting, and allows for locality pay adjustments applicable to employees in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. However, because VSEE rotators are federal employees, NSF caps their salaries at the federal maximum for the position they hold at NSF. Both IPA and VSEE rotators are eligible for certain types of reimbursement, such as moving expenses or per diem allowances. Rotators are generally assigned to one of NSF’s seven directorates that support science and engineering research and education. Each directorate is headed by an assistant director and deputy assistant director. Directorates are further divided into divisions, offices, or sections. Each division is headed by a division director and typically a deputy division director, and each office is headed by an office director and typically a deputy office director. All these positions are executive positions at NSF. At the staff level, NSF uses program directors—subject matter experts in the scientific areas they manage—to conduct reviews of proposals and recommend which projects the agency should fund.

Benefits include fresh perspectives and close connections to the scientific community, while challenges include staffing turnover and higher costs for some rotators compared with permanent employees. GAO was asked to review NSF's use and management of the IPA and VSEE rotator programs, among other things. This report examines (1) the number, costs, and uses of NSF rotators for fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2017; (2) the strategies NSF has used to manage rotator costs and the results of these efforts; and (3) the extent to which NSF has a workforce strategy for using rotators and has evaluated the results of its rotator programs. GAO analyzed summary-level data on NSF's rotators; reviewed key documents; interviewed NSF officials; conducted semistructured interviews with a nongeneralizable sample of rotators and permanent federal employees selected from different scientific directorates within NSF; and compared NSF's management of the program to key principles for effective strategic workforce planning. The numbers of rotators—outside scientists, engineers, and educators on temporary assignment—at the National Science Foundation (NSF) and their costs in proportion to other staff remained relatively stable in fiscal years 2008 through 2017. Most rotators joined NSF under its Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) mobility program. IPA rotators comprised about 12 percent of NSF's workforce and 17 percent of staff costs on average and were not subject to a federal salary cap. They remain employees of their home institutions, with NSF reimbursing the institutions for most of their salaries and benefits. The remaining rotators are considered temporary federal employees under the Visiting Scientist, Engineer, and Educator (VSEE) program; their salaries could not exceed the federal maximum for their positions. Beginning in fiscal year 2017, NSF adopted IPA rotator program cost management strategies expected to achieve the greatest savings with the least harm to recruitment, but NSF officials said it is too soon to determine the full results. For example, for new IPA rotators who had not yet begun negotiating their assignments, NSF began requiring their home institutions to pay for 10 percent of the rotators' salary and benefits. NSF officials told GAO they expect to issue a report evaluating the strategies in December 2018. NSF's IPA program steering committee recommended developing a workforce strategy for balancing the agency's use of rotators with federal staff, but as of June 2018, NSF had not developed a strategy or fully evaluated the IPA and VSEE rotator programs' results, as called for by GAO's key principles for effective strategic workforce planning. NSF officials said they recognized the value of a workforce strategy but were focusing instead on other workforce planning efforts, and they had not fully evaluated program results in part because rotators are blended into the agency's permanent workforce, making a separate evaluation difficult. Without a workforce strategy and evaluation of results, NSF is limited in its ability to manage and, if warranted, adjust its use of rotators. GAO recommends that NSF develop an agency-wide strategy for balancing the agency's use of rotators with permanent staff and evaluate the contributions of its rotator programs toward NSF's human capital goals and programmatic results. NSF agreed with GAO's recommendations."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5856}
{"pred": " \n\nThe 116th Congress may consider various housing-related issues, including housing finance reform, federal housing programs, and tax provisions. The report outlines key trends and challenges in the U.S. housing and mortgage markets, as well as potential legislative actions. \n\nCurrently, home prices have been rising steadily since 2012, with annual increases often exceeding 5%, and this trend has continued into 2019. Despite low interest rates, rising home prices and rental costs have outpaced income growth, leading to concerns about housing affordability for both homebuyers and renters. While mortgage rates have remained low, the cost of homes has increased, making it more difficult for some households to afford housing. \n\nRising home prices have led to increased demand for housing, but the supply of homes on the market has not kept up with this demand, contributing to higher home prices. The supply of rental units has also not kept up with the increased demand for rental housing, especially for lower-cost units, leading to increased rents. \n\nThe mortgage market is closely tied to owner-occupied housing, as the ability of prospective homebuyers to obtain mortgages and the cost of those mortgages impact housing demand and affordability. \n\nThe report highlights the importance of housing finance reform, particularly in light of the ongoing conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It discusses the potential for legislative action to reform the housing finance system, including the possibility of eliminating the GSEs and replacing them with other entities. \n\nAdditionally, the report touches on the need for oversight of HUD's budget, which is heavily dependent on discretionary funding. The Trump administration's FY2020 budget proposal includes significant cuts to HUD programs, which could impact housing assistance for low-income families. \n\nThe report also discusses the impact of recent disasters on housing assistance programs, including the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018. \n\nFinally, the report mentions the potential for extending certain temporary housing-related tax provisions, such as the exclusion for canceled mortgage debt and the deduction for mortgage insurance premiums. \n\n(Note: This is a condensed version of the report. The actual report is much more detailed and includes references to other CRS reports for further information.)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report about the 116th Congress and housing-related issues. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report mentions that the 116th Congress may consider various housing issues, such as assisted housing programs", "answers": ["The 116th Congress may consider a variety of housing-related issues. These could include topics related to housing finance, federal housing assistance programs, and housing-related tax provisions, among other things. Particular issues that may be of interest during the Congress include the following: The status of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) that have been in conservatorship since 2008. Congress might consider comprehensive housing finance reform legislation to resolve the status of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Furthermore, a new director for the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's regulator and conservator, was sworn in on April 15, 2019. Congress may take an interest in any administrative changes that FHFA might make to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under new leadership. Appropriations for federal housing programs, including programs at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and rural housing programs administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), particularly in light of discretionary budget caps that are currently scheduled to decrease for FY2020. Oversight of the implementation of certain changes to federal assisted housing programs that were enacted in prior Congresses, such as expansions of HUD's Moving to Work (MTW) program and Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program. Considerations related to housing and the federal response to major disasters, including oversight of the implementation of certain changes related to Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) assistance that were enacted in the previous Congress. Consideration of legislation related to certain federal housing programs that provide assistance to Native Americans living in tribal areas. Consideration of legislation to extend certain temporary tax provisions that are currently expired, including housing-related provisions that provide a tax exclusion for canceled mortgage debt and allow for the deductibility of mortgage insurance premiums, respectively. Housing and mortgage market conditions provide context for these and other issues that Congress may consider, although housing markets are local in nature and national housing market indicators do not necessarily accurately reflect conditions in specific communities. On a national basis, some key characteristics of owner-occupied housing markets and the mortgage market in recent years include increasing housing prices, low mortgage interest rates, and home sales that have been increasing but constrained by a limited inventory of homes on the market. Key characteristics of rental housing markets include an increasing number of renters, low rental vacancy rates, and increasing rents. Rising home prices and rents that have outpaced income growth in recent years have led to policymakers and others increasingly raising concerns about the affordability of both owner-occupied and rental housing. Affordability challenges are most prominent among the lowest-income renter households, reflecting a shortage of rental housing units that are both affordable and available to this population."], "all_classes": null, "length": 7818}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report about U.S. corporate income tax and inversions. Let me start by reading through the report to understand the main points.\n\nThe report discusses the U.S. corporate income tax system, which taxes worldwide income. It mentions that corporations with operations in multiple jurisdictions face challenges in tax administration and compliance. Some strategies to reduce tax liabilities are called expatriation, inversions, and mergers. The report begins by explaining the relevant parts of the U.S. corporate income tax system, then examines how inversions were commonly structured. It then looks at how Congress and the Department of the Treasury have reduced the benefits of inversions. The report concludes with an examination of remaining methods for inverting and policy options available to prevent or limit these inversions. \n\nIt talks about how inversions became more difficult with the enactment of the American Jobs Creation Act of 204. The JOBS Act denied or restricted the tax benefits of an inversion if the owners of the new company were not substantially different from the owners of the original company. The act also allowed a firm to invert only if it had substantial business operations in the country where the new headquarters was to be located. Although the 204 legislation largely prevented the types of inversions that drew attention prior to its adoption, several companies have successfully inverted in the past few years by using the substantial business operations mechanism or merging. \n\nThe report discusses the history of corporate inversions, including notable cases like Ingersoll-Rand, Tyco, PXRE Group, Foster Wheeler, Nabors Industries, and Coopers Industries. These inversions typically involved little or no shift in actual economic activity from the United States abroad, at least in the near term. The report also mentions the 204 Act, which denied or restricted the tax benefits of an inversion if the owners of the new company were not substantially different from the owners of the original company. The act also allowed a firm to invert only if it had substantial business operations in the target country. \n\nThe report also covers the changes made by the Treasury Department to limit the benefits of inversions. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA; P.L. 108-357) introduced two alternative tax regimes applicable to inversions occurring after March 4, 2003. The AJCA treats the inverted foreign parent company as a domestic corporation if it is owned by at least 80% of", "answers": ["News reports in the late 1990s and early 2000s drew attention to a phenomenon sometimes called corporate \"inversions\" or \"expatriations\": instances where U.S. firms reorganize their structure so that the \"parent\" element of the group is a foreign corporation rather than a corporation chartered in the United States. The main objective of these transactions was tax savings, and they involved little to no shift in actual economic activity. Bermuda and the Cayman Islands (countries with no corporate income tax) were the locations of many of the newly created parent corporations. These types of inversions largely ended with the enactment of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (JOBS Act; P.L. 108-357), which denied the tax benefits of an inversion if the original U.S. stockholders owned 80% or more of the new firm. The act effectively ended shifts to tax havens where no real business activity took place. However, two avenues for inverting remained. The act allowed a firm to invert if it has substantial business operations in the country where the new parent was to be located; the regulations at one point set a 10% level of these business operations. Several inversions using the business activity test resulted in Treasury regulations in 2012 that increased the activity requirement to 25%, effectively closing off this method. Firms could also invert by merging with a foreign company if the original U.S. stockholders owned less than 80% of the new firm. If the original U.S. shareholders owned less than 60%, the firm was not considered as inverting. Two features made a country an attractive destination: a low corporate tax rate and a territorial tax system that did not tax foreign source income. The U.K. joined countries such as Ireland, Switzerland, and Canada as targets for inverting when it adopted a territorial tax in 2009. At the same time, the U.K. also lowered its rate (from 25% to 20% by 2015). Inverted firms could reduce worldwide taxes by stripping taxable earnings out of the new U.S. subsidiary, largely through allocating debt to that subsidiary. Soon after, several high-profile companies indicated an interest in merging with a non-U.S. headquartered company, including Pfizer, Chiquita, AbbVie, and Burger King. This \"second wave\" of inversions again raised concerns about an erosion of the U.S. tax base. Chiquita and AbbVie canceled their plans in the wake of 2014 Treasury regulations, but Burger King and other firms completed merger plans. Pfizer subsequently terminated its planned merger with Allergan after Treasury regulations issued in 2016. Evidence suggests that these Treasury regulations have been an important factor in subsequently decreasing these merger-related inversions. Two policy options had been discussed in response: a general reform of the U.S. corporate tax and specific provisions to deal with tax-motivated international mergers. In December 2017, P.L. 115-97 (popularly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) lowered the corporate tax rate as part of broader tax reform which some argued would slow the rate of inversions. Other tax reform proposals suggested that if the United States moved to a territorial tax, the incentive to invert would be eliminated. There were concerns that a territorial tax could worsen the profit-shifting that already exists among multinational firms. P.L. 115-97, while moving in some ways to a territorial tax, also instituted a number of measures aimed at combatting profit shifting, including a global minimum tax on intangible income that limited the tax benefits of a territorial tax. The second option is to directly target inversions. The 2017 act included several provisions that discouraged inversions. In addition, further anti-inversion provisions have been introduced, most recently H.R. 5108 and S. 2459 in the 115th Congress, to treat all firms in which former U.S. shareholders have more than 50% ownership (or in which management and control is in the United States) as U.S. firms. These bills also provided that debt could also be allocated to the U.S. member of a worldwide operation in proportion to the U.S. ownership of assets."], "all_classes": null, "length": 9230}

The key points are:\n\n1. **UN Peacekeeping Operations**: As of June 2017, the UN has 16 active operations, with 8 in sub-Saharan Africa. These operations have evolved from primarily military to multidimensional, involving civilian and police personnel. Their goals include protecting civilians, supporting elections, and restoring rule of law.\n\n2. **Cost Comparison**: The UN spent about $2.4 billion on MINUSCA. A hypothetical U.S. operation would cost nearly $5.7 billion, more than twice the UN cost. The U.S. contributed about $700 million to the UN for MINUSCA. Thus, the U.S. cost estimate is about eight times higher than its contribution to MINUSCA.\n\n3. **Reasons for Cost Differences**: \n   - **Transportation of supplies and equipment**: The UN uses local infrastructure and in-country supplies, while the U.S. would airlift most of its consumables from Italy and transport equipment from the U.S. to CAR. This leads to higher costs for the U.S. \n   - **Airlift costs**: The U.S. would spend nearly $700 million on airlifting water, food, and other subsistence items. The UN's cost for similar items is lower.\n   - **Personnel and compensation**: The U.S. would pay full salaries and hardship duty pay for reservist personnel, while the UN pays a standard troop cost reimbursement to troop-contributing countries, which does not include salaries. \n   - **Facilities and related costs**: The U.S. would also have higher standards for facilities, including residential leases for civilian personnel, leading to higher costs.\n\n4. **Strengths of UN and U.S. Operations**: \n   - **UN**: International acceptance, global expertise, and ability to leverage multilateral assistance.\n   - **U.S.**: Faster deployment, superior command and control, logistics, intelligence, and counterterrorism capabilities.\n\nThe summary needs to be concise, covering these points. I should mention the number of operations, the shift to multidimensional, the cost comparison, the reasons for", "answers": ["To promote international peace and security, the UN had 16 ongoing peacekeeping operations worldwide as of June 30, 2017, with a total budget of almost $8 billion in UN fiscal year 2017 and contributions of over 100,000 military, police, and civilian personnel from more than 120 countries. The United States is the largest financial contributor to UN peacekeeping operations, providing an average of about 28 percent of total funding annually. The Department of State Authorities Act, Fiscal Year 2017, includes a provision for GAO to compare the costs, strengths, and limitations of UN and U.S. peacekeeping operations. This report (1) compares the reported costs of a specific UN operation to the estimated costs of a hypothetical, comparable operation implemented by the United States; (2) identifies factors that affect cost differences; and (3) identifies stakeholder views on the relative strengths of UN and U.S. peacekeeping operations. GAO worked with the UN, DOD, and State to generate a cost estimate of a hypothetical U.S.-led operation in the Central African Republic comparable to MINUSCA. GAO developed this estimate using DOD's cost estimating tool for contingency operations and State data on civilian costs, assuming a U.S. operation using roughly the same levels of military and civilian personnel as MINUSCA. The cost estimate should not be construed as suggesting that the United States would likely implement such an operation in the Central African Republic or that it would implement such an operation in the same way. GAO is making no recommendations. Based on United Nations (UN) and Departments of Defense (DOD) and State (State) data, GAO estimates that it would cost the United States more than twice as much as it would cost the UN to implement a hypothetical operation comparable to the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA). MINUSCA cost the UN approximately $2.4 billion for the first 39 months of the operation. GAO estimates that a hypothetical U.S. peacekeeping operation in the Central African Republic of roughly the same size and duration would cost nearly $5.7 billion—almost eight times more than the $700 million the United States contributed to MINUSCA over the same time period. Various factors affect differences between the actual cost of MINUSCA and the estimated cost of a hypothetical, comparable U.S. operation in the Central African Republic. The United States and the UN would source and transport some supplies and equipment differently, affecting the cost of both operations; for example, the United States would airlift water into the Central African Republic, while the UN does not do so to the same extent. The United States also would incur the cost of civilian police and military reservist salaries, while the UN does not pay any troop or police salaries. Finally, some higher standards for facilities, intelligence, and medical services increase the U.S. cost estimate relative to UN costs for similar operational elements. UN and U.S. peacekeeping operations have various relative strengths, according to U.S. and UN officials. These officials said that, because the UN is a multilateral organization, UN peacekeeping operations have international acceptance and are more likely to be viewed as impartial. Officials also said that the UN enjoys global access to expertise and experience, and can leverage assistance from multilateral donors and development banks. Relative strengths of a U.S. peacekeeping operation would include faster deployment and superior command and control, logistics, intelligence, and counterterrorism capability, according to U.S. and UN officials."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5006}
{"pred": " The report provides an in-depth examination of the U.S. Small Business Administration's (SBA) size standards, which are used to determine eligibility for SBA programs and federal contracts. The Small Business Act of 1953 (P.L. 83-163, as amended) established the SBA and justified its existence by asserting that small businesses are essential to the maintenance of the free enterprise system. The act aimed to assist small businesses as a means to deter monopoly and oligarchy formation within all industries and the market failures caused by the elimination or reduction of competition in the marketplace. Congress decided to allow the SBA to establish size standards to ensure that only small businesses were provided SBA assistance. The SBA defines a small business as one that is organized for profit; has a place of business in the United States; operates primarily within the United States or makes a significant contribution to the U.S. economy through payment of taxes or use of American products, materials, or labor; is independently owned and operated; and is not dominant in its field on a national basis. The SBA uses two types of size standards to determine program eligibility: (1) industry-specific size standards and (2) alternative size standards based on the applicant's maximum tangible net worth and average net income after federal taxes. The report outlines the historical development of the SBA's size standards, the rationale behind the standards, and the various legislative efforts to modify or replace the standards. The SBA defines a small business as one that is organized for profit; has a place of business in the United States; operates primarily within the United States or makes a significant contribution to the U.S. economy through payment of taxes or use of American products, materials, or labor; is independently owned and operated; and is not dominant in its field on a national basis. The SBA conducts an analysis of various economic factors, such as each industry's overall competitiveness and the competitiveness of firms within each industry, to determine its size standards. The analysis is designed to ensure that only small businesses receive SBA assistance and that these small businesses are not dominant in their field on a national basis. The SBA currently uses two types of size standards to determine program eligibility: (1) number of employees (505 industries), and (2) alternative size standards based on the applicant's maximum tangible net worth and average net income after federal taxes for the two full fiscal years before the date of the application. The SBA's industry-specific size standards are also used to determine eligibility", "answers": ["Small business size standards are of congressional interest because they have a pivotal role in determining eligibility for Small Business Administration (SBA) assistance as well as federal contracting and, in some instances, tax preferences. Although there is bipartisan agreement that the nation's small businesses play an important role in the American economy, there are differences of opinion concerning how to define them. The Small Business Act of 1953 (P.L. 83-163, as amended) authorized the SBA to establish size standards to ensure that only small businesses receive SBA assistance. The SBA currently uses two types of size standards to determine SBA program eligibility: industry-specific size standards and alternative size standards based on the applicant's maximum tangible net worth and average net income after federal taxes. The SBA's industry-specific size standards determine program eligibility for firms in 1,036 industrial classifications in 23 sub-industry activities described in the 2017 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The size standards are based on one of four measures: (1) number of employees, (2) average annual receipts in the previous three (may soon be the previous five) years, (3) average asset size as reported in the firm's four quarterly financial statements for the preceding year, or (4) a combination of number of employees and barrel per day refining capacity. Overall, about 97% of all employer firms qualify as small under the SBA's size standards. These firms represent about 30% of industry receipts. The SBA conducts an analysis of various economic factors, such as each industry's overall competitiveness and the competitiveness of firms within each industry, to determine its size standards. However, in the absence of precise statutory guidance and consensus on how to define small, the SBA's size standards have often been challenged, typically by industry representatives seeking to increase the number of firms eligible for assistance and by Members concerned that the size standards may not adequately target assistance to firms that they consider to be truly small. This report provides a historical examination of the SBA's size standards and assesses competing views concerning how to define a small business. It also discusses P.L. 111-240, the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, which authorized the SBA to establish an alternative size standard using maximum tangible net worth and average net income after federal taxes for both the 7(a) and 504/CDC loan guaranty programs; established, until the SBA acted, an interim alternative size standard for the 7(a) and 504/CDC programs of not more than $15 million in tangible net worth and not more than $5 million in average net income after federal taxes (excluding any carry-over losses) for the two full fiscal years before the date of the application; and required the SBA to conduct a detailed review of not less than one-third of the SBA's industry size standards every 18 months beginning on the new law's date of enactment (September 27, 2010) and ensure that each size standard is reviewed at least once every five years. P.L. 112-239, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, which directed the SBA not to limit the number of size standards and to assign the appropriate size standard to each NAICS industrial classification. This provision addressed the SBA's practice of limiting the number of size standards it used and combining size standards within industrial groups as a means to reduce the complexity of its size standards and to provide greater consistency for industrial classifications that have similar economic characteristics. P.L. 114-328, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, which authorizes the SBA to establish different size standards for agricultural enterprises using existing methods and appeal processes. Previously, the small business size standard for agricultural enterprises was set in statute as having annual receipts not in excess of $750,000. P.L. 115-324, the Small Business Runway Extension Act of 2018, which directs federal agencies proposing a size standard (and, based on report language accompanying the act, presumably the SBA as well) to use the average annual gross receipts from at least the previous five years, instead of the previous three years, when seeking SBA approval to establish a size standard based on annual gross receipts.

{"pred": " The report discusses the shift in U.S. retirement plans from Defined Benefit (DB) plans to Defined Contribution (DC) plans over the last three decades. This shift has transferred certain risks, such as investment risk, from employers to employees. DB plans offer a fixed monthly income based on a formula, while DC plans, such as 401(k) plans, depend on contributions and investment performance. In 2016, there were 656,241 DC plans and 46,300 DB plans in the U.S. Tax incentives are in place to encourage both employers and employees to save for retirement. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), employers may sponsor DC plans, including 401(k) plans, where benefits are based on contributions and investment returns. Employees may take loans or hardship withdrawals for pressing financial needs. The report highlights that early withdrawals of retirement savings can have both short-term and long-term impacts on participants’ ability to accumulate retirement savings. For example, early distributions may result in the permanent removal of assets from retirement accounts thereby reducing the amounts participants can save before retirement, including the loss of compounded interest or other earnings on the amounts over the participant’s career. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. workers are likely to have multiple jobs in their careers as average employee tenure has decreased. In 2017, BLS reported that from 1978 to 2014, workers held an average of 12 jobs between the ages of 18 and 50. In 2016, the median job tenure for a worker was just over 4 years. Employees who separate from a job bear responsibility for deciding what to do with their accumulated assets in their former employer’s plan. Recent research estimates that 10 million people with a retirement plan change jobs each year, many of whom faced a decision on how to treat their account balance at job separation. Plan administrators representatives were required to provide a tax notice detailing participants’ options for handling the balance of their accounts. When participants separate from their employers, they generally have one of three options: 1. They may leave the balance in the plan, 2. They may ask their employer to roll the money directly into a new qualified employer plan or IRA (known as a direct rollover), or 3. They may request a distribution. Once the participant receives the distribution he or she can (1) within ", "answers": ["Federal law encourages individuals to save for retirement through tax incentives for 401(k) plans and IRAs—the predominant forms of retirement savings in the United States. In 2017, U.S. plans and IRAs reportedly held investments worth nearly $17 trillion dollars. Federal law also allows individuals to withdraw assets from these accounts under certain circumstances. DOL and IRS oversee 401(k) plans, and collect annual plan data—including financial information—on the Form 5500. For both IRAs and 401(k) plans, GAO was asked to examine: (1) the incidence and amount of early withdrawals; (2) factors that might lead individuals to access retirement savings early; and (3) policies and strategies that might reduce the incidence and amounts of early withdrawals. To answer these questions, GAO analyzed data from IRS, the Census Bureau, and DOL from 2013 (the most recent complete data available); and interviewed a diverse range of stakeholders identified in the literature, including representatives of companies sponsoring 401(k) plans, plan administrators, subject matter experts, industry representatives, and participant advocates. In 2013 individuals in their prime working years (ages 25 to 55) removed at least $69 billion (+/- $3.5 billion) of their retirement savings early, according to GAO's analysis of 2013 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Department of Labor (DOL) data. Withdrawals from individual retirement accounts (IRA)—$39.5 billion (+/- $2.1 billion)—accounted for much of the money removed early, were equivalent to 3 percent (+/- 0.15 percent) of the age group's total IRA assets, and exceeded their IRA contributions in 2013. Participants in employer-sponsored plans, like 401(k) plans, withdrew at least $29.2 billion (+/- $2.8 billion) early as hardship withdrawals, lump sum payments made at job separation (known as cashouts), and loan balances that borrowers did not repay. Hardship withdrawals in 2013 were equivalent to about 0.5 percent (+/-0.06 percent) of the age group's total plan assets and about 8 percent (+/- 0.9 percent) of their contributions. However, the incidence and amount of certain unrepaid plan loans cannot be determined because the Form 5500—the federal government's primary source of information on employee benefit plans—does not capture these data. Stakeholders GAO interviewed identified flexibilities in plan rules and individuals' pressing financial needs, such as out-of-pocket medical costs, as factors affecting early withdrawals of retirement savings. Stakeholders said that certain plan rules, such as setting high minimum loan thresholds, may cause individuals to take out more of their savings than they need. Stakeholders also identified several elements of the job separation process affecting early withdrawals, such as difficulties transferring account balances to a new plan and plans requiring the immediate repayment of outstanding loans, as relevant factors. Stakeholders GAO interviewed suggested strategies they believed could balance early access to accounts with the need to build long-term retirement savings. For example, plan sponsors said allowing individuals to continue to repay plan loans after job separation, restricting participant access to plan sponsor contributions, allowing partial distributions at job separation, and building emergency savings features into plan designs, could help preserve retirement savings (see figure). However, they noted, each strategy involves tradeoffs, and the strategies' broader implications require further study. GAO recommends that, as part of revising the Form 5500, DOL and IRS require plan sponsors to report the incidence and amount of all 401(k) plan loans that are not repaid.

Then it mentions the brief independence in 1918 and the Soviet Union's incorporation in 1921-1922. After the Soviet Union collapsed, Georgia regained independence in 1991. \n\nGeographically, Georgia is in the South Caucasus, between the Black and Caspian Seas, separated from Russia by the Caucasus Mountains. It borders Armenia and Azerbaijan, which have a long-standing conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. Also, Georgia has two Russian-backed regions, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which are in conflict with the Georgian government. These regions have ethnic groups that identify more with the North Caucasus in Russia. After the 2008 war, Russia recognized these regions and stationed troops there. \n\nThe report also covers Georgia's language and religion. Georgians speak a distinct language with a literary form from the 5th century. The Georgian Orthodox Church is autocephalous, dating back to the 4th century. \n\nIn terms of governance, Georgia has a parliamentary system since 2013 and 2018 reforms. The prime minister is the most powerful executive, while the president is the commander-in-chief and has veto power. The current prime minister is Mamuka Bakhtadze, and the president is Salome Zurabishvili. The parliament is unicameral with 150 members elected by party list and majoritarian districts. The ruling party, Georgian Dream, won a large majority in 2016 and had significant power, leading to concerns about checks and balances. The opposition, European Georgia, and the nationalist Alliance for Patriots, have some representation. \n\nThe political landscape includes recent elections, with the 2018 presidential election being competitive but flawed. There were issues like official pressure on state employees, ballot stuffing, and allegations of mass vote-buying.

U.S. policy expressly supports Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, and Georgia is a leading recipient of U.S. aid to Europe and Eurasia. Many observers consider Georgia to be one of the most democratic states in the post-Soviet region, even as the country faces ongoing governance challenges. The center-left Georgian Dream-Democratic Georgia party (GD) has close to a three-fourths supermajority in parliament and governs with limited checks and balances. Although Georgia faces high rates of poverty and underemployment, its economy in 2017 and 2018 appeared to show stronger growth than it had in the previous four years. The GD led a coalition to victory in parliamentary elections in 2012 amid growing dissatisfaction with the former ruling party, Mikheil Saakashvili's center-right United National Movement, which came to power as a result of Georgia's 2003 Rose Revolution. In August 2008, Russia went to war with Georgia to prevent Saakashvili's government from reestablishing control over the regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which broke away from Georgia in the early 1990s and became informal Russian protectorates. Congress has expressed firm support for Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-44, Title II, §253) states that the United States \"does not recognize territorial changes effected by force, including the illegal invasions and occupations\" of Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and other territories occupied by Russia. In September 2016, the House of Representatives passed H.Res. 660, which condemns Russia's military intervention and occupation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. In February 2019, the Georgia Support Act (H.R. 598), which originally passed the House by unanimous consent in the 115th Congress (H.R. 6219), was reintroduced in the 116th Congress. The act would express support for Georgia's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, as well as for its democratic development, Euro-Atlantic integration, and peaceful conflict resolution in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The United States provides substantial foreign and military aid to Georgia each year. Since 2010, U.S. nonmilitary aid to Georgia has totaled around $64 million a year on average, in addition to a five-year Millennium Challenge Corporation grant of $140 million to support education. In FY2019, Congress appropriated almost $90 million in nonmilitary aid to Georgia. Since 2010, U.S. military aid to Georgia has been estimated at around $68 million a year on average. In FY2019, Congress appropriated $35 million in Foreign Military Financing and $2 million in International Military Education and Training funds.

The 21st Century Cures Act included a provision for GAO to examine certain issues pertaining to LTCHs. This report examines (1) the health care needs of Medicare beneficiaries who receive services from the two qualifying hospitals; (2) how Medicare LTCH payment polices could affect the two qualifying hospitals; and (3) how the two qualifying hospitals compare with other LTCHs and other facilities that may treat Medicare patients with similar conditions. GAO analyzed the most recently available Medicare claims and other data for the two qualifying hospitals and other facilities that treat patients with spinal cord injuries. GAO also interviewed HHS officials and stakeholders from the qualifying hospitals, other facilities that treat spinal cord patients, specialty associations, and others. GAO provided a draft of this report to HHS. HHS provided technical comments, which were incorporated as appropriate. We also provided the two qualifying hospitals summaries of information we collected from them, to confirm the accuracy of statements included in our draft report. We incorporated their comments, as appropriate. Spinal cord injuries may result in secondary complications that often lead to decreased functional independence and quality of life. The 21st Century Cures Act changed how Medicare pays certain long-term care hospitals (LTCH) that provide spinal cord specialty treatment. For these hospitals, the act included a temporary exception from how Medicare pays other LTCHs. Two LTCHs—Craig Hospital in Englewood, Colorado and Shepherd Center in Atlanta, Georgia—have qualified for this exception. GAO found that most Medicare beneficiaries treated at these two hospitals typically receive specialized care for multiple chronic conditions and other long-term complications that develop after initial injuries, such as pressure ulcers that can result in life-threatening infection. The two hospitals also provide specialty care for acquired brain injuries, such as traumatic brain injuries. GAO's simulations of Medicare payments to these two hospitals using claims data from two baseline years—fiscal years 2013 and 2016—illustrate potential effects of payment policies. LTCHs are paid under a two-tiered system for care provided to beneficiaries: they receive the LTCH standard federal payment rate—or standard rate—for certain patients discharged from the LTCH, and a generally lower rate—known as a “site-neutral” rate—for all other discharges. Under the temporary exception, Craig Hospital and Shepherd Center receive the standard rate for all discharges during fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Assuming their types of discharges remain the same as in fiscal years 2013 and 2016, GAO's simulations of Medicare payments in the baseline years indicate: Most of the discharges we examined would not qualify for the standard rate, if the exception did not apply. Medicare payments would generally decrease under fiscal year 2020 payment policy, once the exception expires. However, the actual effects of Medicare's payment policies on these two hospitals could vary based on factors, including the severity of patient conditions (e.g., Medicare payment is typically higher for more severe injuries), and whether hospitals' discharges meet criteria for the standard rate. Similarities and differences may exist between the two qualifying hospitals and other facilities that treat Medicare patients with spinal cord and brain injuries. Patients with spinal cord and brain injuries may receive care in other LTCHs, but GAO found that most Medicare beneficiaries at these other LTCHs are treated for conditions other than spinal cord and brain injuries. Certain inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRF) also provide post-acute rehabilitation services to patients with spinal cord and brain injuries. While data limitations make a direct comparison between these facilities and the two qualifying hospitals difficult, GAO identified some similarities and differences. For example, officials from some IRFs we interviewed reported providing several of the same programs and services as the two qualifying hospitals to medically complex patients, but the availability of services and complexity of patients varied. Among other reasons, the different Medicare payment requirements that apply to LTCHs and IRFs affect the types of services they provide and the patients they treat."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8494}

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report starts by explaining that Congress has been awarding medals since the late 1700s to show gratitude for contributions. The first medals were issued by the Continental Congress in 1776 for George Washington. It mentions that these medals are meant to honor patriotism, commemorate events, and recognize achievements. The tradition of creating individually struck gold medals is rich in history. However, there are no permanent statutory provisions for these medals. Instead, Congress has created them through special legislative actions when deemed appropriate. The first medals were for military leaders, and over time, the scope expanded to include nonmilitary achievements and various fields. \n\nIn the 19th century, the medals were given for military achievements, but in the 1850s, the scope broadened to include heroic activities and work in specific fields. Examples include Cornelius Vanderbilt, Cyrus Field, and George F. Robinson. Then, in the 20th and 21st centuries, the medals were given for excellence in arts, athletics, aviation, diplomacy, entertainment, exploration, medicine, politics, religion, and science. Notable firsts include George M. Cohan as an entertainer, the Wright brothers for aviation, Lincoln Ellsworth for exploration, and Major Walter Reed for science. \n\nThe process for creating these medals involves legislation, which is typically referred to the House Committee on Financial Services or the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. However, there are no set rules for considering these bills in either chamber. The House has no rules, while the Senate has a rule requiring 67 sponsors for a bill to be considered by the committee. However, the bill can still be brought to the floor without committee consideration. \n\nThe report also discusses the design process, mentioning the Citizens Coinage Advisory Commission (CCAC) and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) as advisory bodies. The legislation typically includes findings, design specifications, and provisions for duplicates. \n\nThere are no statutory limits on the number of medals that can be issued in a year. However, there have been attempts to introduce such limits, like H.R. 54 in the 109th Congress. However, these proposals were not passed", "answers": ["Senators and Representatives are frequently asked to support or sponsor proposals recognizing historic events and outstanding achievements by individuals or institutions. Among the various forms of recognition that Congress bestows, the Congressional Gold Medal is often considered the most distinguished. Through this venerable tradition—the occasional commissioning of individually struck gold medals in its name—Congress has expressed public gratitude on behalf of the nation for distinguished contributions for more than two centuries. Since 1776, this award, which initially was bestowed on military leaders, has also been given to such diverse individuals as Sir Winston Churchill and Bob Hope, George Washington and Robert Frost, Joe Louis and Mother Teresa of Calcutta. Congressional gold medal legislation generally has a specific format. Once a gold medal is authorized, it follows a specific process for design, minting, and awarding. This process includes consultation and recommendations by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Commission (CCAC) and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (CFA), pursuant to any statutory instructions, before the Secretary of the Treasury makes the final decision on a gold medal's design. Once the medal has been struck, a ceremony will often be scheduled to formally award the medal to the recipient. In recent years, the number of gold medals awarded has increased, and some have expressed interest in examining the gold medal awarding process. Should Congress want to make such changes, several individual and institutional options might be available. The individual options include decisions made by Members of Congress as to what individual or groups might be honored; potential specification of gold medal design elements; and where gold medals for groups might be housed once the award is made. The institutional options could include House, Senate, or committee rules for the consideration of gold medal legislation and whether statutory standards on the number of gold medals issued per year or per Congress might be established for gold medals."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3411}

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report talks about Cobra Dane and other radar systems contributing to various missions like ballistic missile defense, space surveillance, and intelligence gathering. These radars track incoming missiles, classify threats, and determine if intercepts were successful. Some radars can distinguish warheads from decoys. They also help in space surveillance by tracking objects in orbit. Also, they can support intelligence missions. The capabilities depend on the radar's inherent features and location.\n\nThen there's a part about the Air Force and MDA managing Cobra Dane. Since 2013, Air Force Space Command has been in charge, and the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center handles sustainment. MDA collaborates with the Air Force and combatant commands for missile defense assets. The Air Force and MDA share funding for Cobra Dane. U.S. Northern Command and U.S. Strategic Command set the priorities for radar infrastructure and missions. Cobra Dane is the end user for Northern Command. Strategic Command uses Cobra Dane for ballistic missile defense and space surveillance. The report also mentions the Air Force's January 2018 report to Congress about Cobra Dane and LRDR's capabilities and their locations' effects. \n\nThere's a correction about Cobra Dane not having the capability to determine if a threat was intercepted, which is a future possibility. The LRDR is expected to have unique capabilities, like discrimination of decoys. The report also discusses the locations of the radars and how they affect their ability to contribute to the missions. For example, Cobra Dane's location allows it to track missile threats from North Korea earlier than LRDR. \n\nThe report also mentions the Pacific Radar and Space Fence as potential replacements for Cobra Dane in future missions. The Space Fence is expected to be operational in 2019, which would reduce the need for Cobra Dane in space surveillance. However, the Air Force still wants to use Cobra Dane for space surveillance when the Space Fence is operational, as long as it's available for ballistic missile defense. \n\nThere's a part about the operational availability of Cobra Dane, which was 91% over two years but dropped to 88% in the next two years. The Air Force mentioned that the downtime was scheduled, and they can mitigate the impact by using other radars like the Sea", "answers": ["First fielded in 1976 on Shemya Island in Alaska, the Cobra Dane radar faces growing sustainment challenges that DOD plans to address through modernization projects. Anticipating future needs, DOD began investing in new radar systems that share capabilities with Cobra Dane to support ballistic missile defense and space surveillance, including the LRDR (Alaska), the Space Fence (Marshall Islands), and the Pacific Radar (location to be determined). The conference report accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision that GAO review the Air Force's report to Congress on the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane. This report identifies information included in the Air Force's report and describes additional information that GAO reviewed on (1) the capabilities of the Cobra Dane radar and other planned radars to meet DOD's mission requirements, (2) Cobra Dane's operational availability and the plan to mitigate the effect on those missions when Cobra Dane is not available, and (3) DOD's funding plan and project cost estimates for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane and its site at Shemya Island. GAO reviewed the Air Force report and related documentation, and interviewed relevant officials. In its January 2018 report to Congress, the Air Force reported how the Cobra Dane radar and the Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) have shared and unique capabilities to support ballistic missile defense and space surveillance missions. The report noted that the respective locations of both radar systems affect their ability to provide those capabilities. The Department of Defense (DOD) also has other radar investments—the Pacific Radar and the Space Fence, which, according to DOD officials, may reduce DOD's reliance on Cobra Dane to provide ballistic missile defense and space surveillance capabilities. The Air Force's report to Congress noted that Cobra Dane met its requirement for operational availability, which refers to the percentage of time that the radar is able to meet its missions. GAO found that the Air Force has developed procedures to mitigate risks when Cobra Dane is not available. For example, U.S. Northern Command and Missile Defense Agency (MDA) officials stated that they can mitigate risks when Cobra Dane is not available by using the Sea-Based X-band radar to provide support for ballistic missile defense. The Air Force would face some limitations in its ability to conduct space surveillance if Cobra Dane were not available, as Cobra Dane tracks objects no other radar can track. However, MDA officials noted there are no plans to take Cobra Dane offline long enough to compromise space surveillance. The Air Force and MDA plan to contribute total funding of $278.6 million for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane, according to their fiscal year 2019 budget plans. Specifically, the Air Force and MDA plan to share funding for the operation and maintenance of the Cobra Dane radar and for three modernization projects that make up their sustainment plan for the radar. Further, the Air Force report noted that the Air Force also plans to provide $140 million in funding for the sustainment and maintenance of operational access to Cobra Dane's site at Shemya Island. In addition, GAO found that the Air Force developed a total cost estimate for one project—known as the transmitter group replacement—but not for its other two projects.

{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this DEA report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. The report is about the DEA's role in managing controlled substances, specifically focusing on the Disposal Act and the implementation of prescription drug disposal bins. \n\nFirst, the DEA is responsible for ensuring the availability of controlled substances for legitimate uses while preventing their diversion. They enforce the Controlled Substances Act, which requires registration for entities manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing these substances. The Disposal Act, enacted in 2010, allows the public to dispose of unused controlled substances through authorized collectors. DEA is responsible for creating the regulations, which must balance preventing diversion with public health and safety, ease of implementation, and community participation. \n\nThe Disposal Act provides three methods for disposal: disposal bins, mail-back programs, and take-back events. Law enforcement can use all three without DEA approval. The regulations can't require entities to participate in or establish any of the disposal options. \n\nTo become an authorized collector, eligible entities (retail pharmacies, hospitals/clinics with on-site pharmacies, etc.) must modify their DEA registration. This is free and simple. Once registered, they can install bins in long-term care facilities and their own locations. \n\nThe DEA regulations specify detailed requirements for the bins: secure, locked, with a permanent outer container and removable inner liner, small opening, prominent signage, users must add themselves, bin must be in area with employee, inaccessible when no employee, inner liner must be waterproof, tamper-evident, tear-resistant, opaque, labeled with size and ID number, installation and removal of inner liner must be done under supervision of two employees. \n\nThe inner liner must be destroyed in compliance with laws, and rendered non-retrievable. \n\nAuthorized collectors can destroy the inner liner on their premises if they have the capacity. If not, they can transport the inner liner to a separate location for destruction. \n\nThe DEA provides guidance through their website, FAQs, and training sessions. However, stakeholders have expressed concerns about the clarity and consistency of DEA's communication. \n\nThe report also discusses the participation rates of eligible entities. As of April 2017, about 2.49% of eligible entities had registered as authorized collectors. Most were pharmacies, followed by hospitals/clinics. \n\nParticipation varied by state, with some states having very low rates. North Dakota had the highest participation rate. \n\nThe DEA does not", "answers": ["In 2015, 3.8 million Americans reported misusing prescription drugs within the last month, and deaths from prescription opioids have more than quadrupled since 1999. About half of the people who reported misusing prescription drugs in 2015 received them from a friend or relative. One way to help prevent this kind of diversion and potential misuse is by providing secure and convenient ways to dispose of unused, unneeded, or expired prescription medications. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 authorizes pharmacies and other entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances to also collect unused prescription drugs for disposal. In 2014, DEA finalized regulations for the implementation of the Act, establishing a voluntary process for eligible entities to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs using disposal bins. GAO was asked to review participation among authorized collectors that maintain disposal bins. In this report GAO describes (1) participation rates among entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs and (2) factors that affect participation. GAO analyzed the most currently available DEA data from April 2017 on entities eligible to participate and those participating as authorized collectors. GAO also conducted interviews with DEA officials and a nongeneralizable sample of 11 stakeholder organizations selected to illustrate different types of authorized collectors and long-term care facilities. GAO is not making any recommendations. DEA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. GAO found that about 3 percent of pharmacies and other entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs for disposal have volunteered to do so. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) authorizes these entities to dispose of unused drugs to help reduce their potential misuse. Analysis of DEA data shows that as of April 2017, 2,233 of the 89,550 (2.49 percent) eligible entities—that is, certain entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances—had registered with DEA to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. Most—about 81 percent—of the authorized collectors were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics. GAO also found that participation rates varied by state, though in 44 states less than 5 percent of the state's pharmacies and other eligible entities had registered to become authorized collectors. Stakeholders cited several factors that may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have registered with DEA as authorized collectors of unused drugs. Most notably, stakeholders representing authorized collectors told GAO that because participation is voluntary, the cost associated with maintaining a disposal bin—which includes purchasing and installing the bin according to DEA requirements and paying for the destruction of its contents—is an important factor to weigh against potential benefits. DEA noted that availability of disposal by law enforcement agencies also contributes to low participation."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2930}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about the House of Representatives' suspension of the rules procedure. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report explains how the House can temporarily set aside its rules to expedite legislation. There are two main ways: special rules (special order of business) or motions to suspend the rules. The suspension procedure is used for non-privileged measures, allowing them to be considered without a special rule. It's usually for bills that are broadly supported, so they can pass without amendments or lengthy debate. Most bills in the House are considered under suspension of the rules. The process requires a two-thirds vote, so it's usually for bills that have wide support. The report also provides data from the 114th Congress (2015-2016) on the use of suspension, including the number of measures, sponsors, committee consideration, debate length, voting, and resolution of differences between chambers. There are figures and tables mentioned, like Figure 1 showing that 62% of measures received floor action under suspension. Most suspension measures are bills, with House bills making up the majority. Majority-party members sponsored most suspension measures. Suspension is also used for minority-sponsored measures, but not as much as majority-sponsored ones. Suspension measures are often referred to committees before being considered on the floor. The report also discusses the process of how a motion to suspend the rules is made, the debate time, the role of floor managers, and the voting process. It mentions that suspension measures are not subject to floor amendments, but the motion can include amendments made by the committee or through informal negotiations. The suspension procedure is defined in clause 1 of House Rule XV. The report includes statistical data on the prevalence and form of suspension measures, sponsors, committee consideration, debate length, voting, and resolution of differences between chambers. Table 1 summarizes the final legislative status of measures initially considered in the House under suspension. Figure A-1 shows the use of the suspension procedure from the 110th through the 114th Congresses (2007-2016). \n\nSo the summary needs to capture the main points: the suspension procedure allows non-privileged measures to be considered without a special rule. It's used for bills that are broadly supported, so they can pass without amendments or long debate. The process requires a two-thirds vote, so it's usually for bills that", "answers": ["Suspension of the rules is the most commonly used procedure to call up measures on the floor of the House of Representatives. As the name suggests, the procedure allows the House to suspend its standing and statutory rules in order to consider broadly supported legislation in an expedited manner. More specifically, the House temporarily sets aside its rules that govern the raising and consideration of measures and assumes a new set of constraints particular to the suspension procedure. The suspension of the rules procedure has several parliamentary advantages: (1) it allows nonprivileged measures to be raised on the House floor without the need for a special rule, (2) it enables the consideration of measures that would otherwise be subject to a point of order, and (3) it streamlines floor action by limiting debate and prohibiting floor amendments. Given these features, as well as the required two-thirds supermajority vote for passage, suspension motions are generally used to process less controversial legislation. In the 114th Congress (2015-2016), measures considered under suspension made up 62% of the bills and resolutions that received floor action in the House (743 out of 1,200 measures). The majority of suspension measures were House bills (83%), followed by Senate bills (11%) and House resolutions (4%). The measures covered a variety of policy areas but most often addressed government operations, such as the designation of federal facilities or amending administrative policies. Most measures that are considered in the House under the suspension procedure are sponsored by a House or Senate majority party member. However, suspension is the most common House procedure used to consider minority-party-sponsored legislation regardless of whether the legislation originated in the House or Senate. In 2015 and 2016, minority-party members sponsored 31% of suspension measures, compared to 9% of legislation subject to different procedures, including privileged business (17 measures), unanimous consent (21 measures), and under the terms of a special rule (one Senate bill). Most suspension measures are referred to at least one House committee before their consideration on the floor. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform (now called the Committee on Oversight and Reform) was the committee of primary jurisdiction for the plurality of suspension measures considered in the 114th Congress. Additional committees—such as Energy and Commerce, Homeland Security, Natural Resources, Foreign Affairs, and Veterans' Affairs—also served as the primary committee for a large number of suspension measures. Suspension motions are debatable for up to 40 minutes. In most cases, only a fraction of that debate time is actually used. In the 114th Congress, the average amount of time spent considering a motion to suspend the rules was 13 minutes and 10 seconds. The House adopted nearly every suspension motion considered in 2015 and 2016. Approval by the House, however, did not guarantee final approval in the 114th Congress. The Senate passed or agreed to 40% of the bills, joint resolutions, and concurrent resolutions initially considered in the House under suspension of the rules, and 276 measures were signed into law.

{"pred": " The National Cemeteries Act of 1973 established the modern veterans’ cemetery system in the United States, managed by the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The NCA is responsible for maintaining existing national cemeteries and constructing new ones to serve veterans and their families. Since 1978, the VA has provided funding through the Veterans Cemetery Grants Program to help states and tribes establish, expand, or improve their veterans’ cemeteries. The NCA has revised its policy to lower the threshold for establishing new national cemeteries from 170,000 to 80,000 unserved veterans, based on data from an independent review in 2008. This change allowed VA to build new cemeteries in areas where states might not have been willing to place them due to the size and cost of operating a larger state veterans’ cemetery. The NCA has a variety of facilities to meet the burial needs of veterans, including various cemetery configurations that provide burial options or improve access. NCA uses county-level population data to determine if veterans have reasonable access to burial options and uses county-level population projections to support decisions about future cemetery locations. NCA's plan includes establishing 18 new national cemeteries, comprising five traditional national cemeteries and 13 urban and rural initiative national cemeteries. However, the progress has been limited, as the opening of new cemeteries is years behind the original schedule. The three main challenges faced by NCA are: (1) acquiring suitable land for new national cemeteries, (2) estimating the costs of establishing new national cemeteries, and (3) utilizing all available data to inform the Grants Program targeting unserved veteran populations. The primary reason for the delayed timelines is the difficulty in acquiring suitable land. This includes challenges like finding viable land for development, legal issues related to the acquisition process, and resistance from the local community. For example, in Chicago, NCA has attempted to acquire land for the urban initiative site five times, with the fifth attempt still ongoing. The environmental assessment for the Chicago site is also in progress, and a site viability decision is not expected until late 2019. According to NCA documentation, the Chicago site was initially planned for completion by July 2018, but the fifth attempt to acquire land may result in further delays.

The House Appropriations Committee has expressed concerns that there are geographic pockets where veterans remain unserved by burial options. House Report 115-188 accompanying a bill for the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018, includes a provision for GAO to examine veterans' access to burial options. This report (1) describes VA's plan for increasing reasonable access to burial options for veterans and (2) assesses VA's progress in implementing its plan and any challenges experienced. GAO reviewed applicable VA and NCA documents, compared NCA's cost-estimating practices with GAO's cost-estimating 12 steps, and met with cognizant officials regarding NCA's efforts to provide reasonable access to burial options. Within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) has a plan to establish 18 new national cemeteries to increase reasonable access to burial options for veterans. NCA defines reasonable access as a national or state veterans' cemetery being located within 75 miles of veterans' homes. Key parts of NCA's plan include establishing 13 urban and rural initiative national cemeteries and awarding grant funds to state applicants for establishing new state veterans' cemeteries. NCA has made limited progress in implementing its plan to increase burial access and is years behind its original schedule for opening new cemeteries. For example, NCA has opened only two of its planned urban and rural initiative sites and is behind its original schedule for the other 11 (see fig. below). The primary factor delaying NCA's completion of these cemeteries has been challenges in acquiring suitable land. NCA has also been challenged in producing accurate estimates of construction costs for most of its rural initiative sites. Cost estimates have increased more than 200 percent (from about $7 million to $24 million) for these sites, and NCA's guidance for developing cost estimates for the cemeteries does not fully incorporate the 12 steps identified in cost-estimating leading practices—such as conducting a risk and uncertainty analysis or a sensitivity analysis. As a result, NCA is not well positioned to provide reliable and valid cost estimates to better inform decisions to enhance veterans' cemetery access.

It highlights historical issues, such as the 2000 presidential election, where administrative problems led to delayed results, and similar issues in 2016 and 2018. The Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) is mentioned as a key federal law that requires states to establish uniform standards for what counts as a vote. The report explains that while federal laws exist, their implementation is largely handled by localities, which are often counties, though some states have different structures.\n\nThe report outlines the three main components of the election process: voter registration, vote casting, and vote counting. It describes how these duties are distributed among state and local governments, noting that states generally play the primary decision-making role in election administration. State legislatures, with input from governors, can make state laws about the administration of elections and make or initiate election administration amendments to their state constitutions. State laws and constitutions can also delegate or defer responsibility for decisions about the administration of elections to other state or local officials and to voters.\n\nThe report also discusses the funding aspects of election administration, noting that the federal government does not provide ongoing funding to states and localities for conducting elections. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) is the only major federal funding program for election administration, and it has been used to help replace or update voting technology in many states. However, the day-to-day implementation of election administration policy is still mostly handled by localities, with counties being the primary level of responsibility in most states.\n\nThe report provides an overview of the structures and leadership of state and local election systems, noting that these can vary significantly between and within states. It also highlights the importance of understanding these structures for Congress, as they can influence the effectiveness of federal actions on election administration.\n\nThe report concludes with considerations for future congressional actions, such as how proposed changes might interact with state and local systems, the best policy tools for achieving goals, and potential unintended consequences of changes.\n\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report. Let me start by reading through the original report again to make sure I understand the key points. The report is about election administration in the U.S., focusing on how it's decentralized, managed by state and local governments. It mentions historical issues like the 2000 election where vote counting problems delayed results,", "answers": ["The administration of elections in the United States is highly decentralized. Elections are primarily administered by thousands of state and local systems rather than a single, unified national system. States and localities share responsibility for most election administration duties. Exactly how responsibilities are assigned at the state and local levels varies both between and within states, but there are some general patterns in the distribution of duties. States typically have primary responsibility for making decisions about the rules of elections (policymaking). Localities typically have primary responsibility for conducting elections in accordance with those rules (implementation). Localities, with varying contributions from states, typically also have primary responsibility for paying for the activities and resources required to conduct elections (funding). The structures of the state and local systems that conduct elections also vary between and within states. Common variations include differences related to the leadership of the system, the relationship between local election officials and the state, and the population size and density of the jurisdiction the system serves. The leadership of a state or local election system may be elected or appointed, and both the leaders and the methods used to select them may be partisan, bipartisan, or nonpartisan. State officials may have more or less direct influence over local election officials, and the extent of their influence may be affected by other structural features of the state's election systems, such as the methods used to select local officials. Finally, larger election jurisdictions have different administrative advantages and challenges than smaller ones, and more urban jurisdictions have different advantages and challenges than more rural ones. These differences between jurisdictions may be reflected in structural features of the election systems that serve them, such as how the systems allocate resources and where they find specialized expertise. Understanding the duties and structures of state and local election systems may be relevant to Congress for at least two reasons. First, the way state and local election systems work can affect how well federal action on election administration serves its intended purposes. The effectiveness of federal action depends in part on how it is implemented. How it is implemented can depend, in turn, on how the state and local election systems that implement it work. Second, Congress can make or incentivize changes to the way state and local election systems work. Congress has a number of policy tools it can use to affect the administration of federal elections. The use of these tools can—either intentionally or unintentionally—affect the state and local election systems that administer federal elections."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3965}
{"pred": " The report discusses the progress and challenges in improving safety at public grade crossings in the United States. Since 1975, there has been a significant reduction in grade-crossing crashes and fatalities, with the number of crashes dropping from 13,126 in 1975 to 2,117 in 2017, and fatalities decreasing from 917 to 273. However, since 2009, the number of crashes and fatalities has plateaued, with around 2,100 crashes and 250 fatalities annually. These fatalities account for less than one percent of all highway-related fatalities. The decrease in crashes and fatalities occurred despite an increase in train and highway traffic volumes. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is concerned that with the continued increase in traffic, crashes and fatalities may also rise. The Section 130 Program, a set-aside portion of the Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP), provides federal funds to state Departments of Transportation (DOTs) for grade-crossing safety improvements. States determine the necessary improvements, and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) oversees the use of federal funds. The program requires that at least 50% of funds be used for protective devices, such as gates and lights. States can use remaining funds for other safety measures. The program has been effective in reducing the risk of crashes, but recent trends suggest that the program may not be sufficient to address the growing risk factors. The report highlights that the most significant reductions in crashes and fatalities were achieved from 1975 to 1985, when states closed or improved the most dangerous crossings. Grade-crossing safety continued to improve until the mid-2000s, though at a slower rate. The Section 130 Program has been instrumental in reducing the risk of crashes, but the program's structure may not be adequate to address the evolving nature of risk. The report also discusses the research efforts by FRA to understand the causes of grade-crossing crashes and identify potential improvements. The research has found that the volumes of train and vehicle traffic at a crossing are the biggest predictors of grade-crossing crashes. Changes in vehicle and train traffic therefore affect the annual number of grade-crossing crashes. For example, as highway traffic decreased in 2008, so too did the number of grade-crossing crashes. The report also outlines the challenges states face in implementing and evaluating grade-crossing safety projects, including", "answers": ["Crashes at highway-rail grade crossings are one of the leading causes of railroad-related deaths. According to FRA data, in 2017, there were more than 2,100 crashes resulting in 273 fatalities. Since 2009 crashes have occurred at a fairly constant rate. The federal government provides states funding to improve grade-crossing safety through FHWA's Section 130 Program. The persistence of crashes and deaths raises questions about the effectiveness of the federal grade-crossing-safety program. GAO was asked to review federal efforts to improve grade-crossing safety. This report examines: (1) the focus of FRA's grade-crossing-safety research, (2) how states select and implement grade-crossing projects and what data are available from FRA to inform their decisions, and (3) the challenges states reported in implementing and assessing projects and the extent to which FHWA assesses the program's effectiveness. GAO analyzed FRA data; reviewed FRA's, FHWA's, and states' documents; reviewed a study of states' selection of projects; and interviewed FRA and FHWA headquarters and field staff, and officials from a non-generalizable sample of eight states, selected to include a mix in the number of grade crossings and crashes, and geographic diversity. Research sponsored by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has identified driver behavior as the main cause of highway-rail grade crossing crashes and that factors such as train and traffic volume can contribute to the risk of a crash. (See figure.) Over 70 percent of fatal crashes in 2017 occurred at grade crossings with gates. To meet the requirements of the federal grade-crossing program, states are responsible for selecting and ensuring the implementation of grade-crossing improvement projects. Most state DOT officials and other relevant transportation officials use local knowledge of grade crossings to supplement the results of models that rank grade crossings based on the risk of an accident. These states generally consider the same primary risk factors, such as vehicle and train traffic. FRA is taking steps to improve the data used in its model to help states assess risk factors at grade crossings. For example, FRA's grade-crossing inspectors will review and identify issues with railroad- and state-reported inventory data. FRA is currently developing guidelines, which it plans to finalize by the end of 2018, to implement these inspections as it has for other types of FRA inspections. Officials we spoke with in eight states reported challenges in pursuing certain types of projects that could further enhance safety, in part because of federal requirements. While safety has improved, many crashes occur at grade crossings with gates, and officials said there could be additional ways to focus program requirements to continue improving safety. States' and the Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) reporting focuses on the program's funding and activity, such as the number and types of projects, yet the low number of crashes makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of projects in reducing crashes and fatalities. FHWA reports the program has been effective in reducing fatalities by about 74 percent since 1975. However, since 2009, annually there have been about 250 fatalities—almost one percent of total highway fatalities. FRA expects future crashes to grow, in part, due to the anticipated increase in rail and highway traffic. An evaluation of the program should consider whether its funding and other requirements allow states to adequately address ongoing safety issues. FHWA officials said they are not required to perform such evaluations. GAO has previously reported on the importance of program evaluations to determine the extent to which a program is meeting its objectives. An evaluation of the program could lead FHWA to identify changes that could allow states to more strategically address problem areas. GAO recommends that FHWA evaluate the program's requirements to determine if they allow states the flexibility to address ongoing safety issues. The Department of Transportation concurred with GAO's recommendation."], "all_classes": null, "length": 7675}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about the Purple Heart. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report talks about how the criteria for the Purple Heart have changed over time. It mentions that new events and changes in military, political, or social conditions can lead to debates about who is eligible. Veterans groups are often involved in these debates. Congress has considered several bills to change eligibility for the Purple Heart, especially regarding the Purple Heart and conditions under which it is awarded. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have increased the number of Purple Hearts awarded, as well as the conditions. Conditions like TBI and PTSD, as well as accidents while deployed, bring up new questions about when a servicemember deserves the Purple Heart. \n\nThere was a shooting in Chattanooga, TN, which again raised questions about applying the Purple Heart to terrorist attacks versus criminal acts. Veterans groups argue that a servicemember with PTSD may not always deserve the same recognition as a servicemember killed or wounded in direct combat. Others argue that these conditions can debilitate servicemembers just as much as physical injuries and can have lasting effects on servicemembers' lives. \n\nThe debate is about what actions and events qualify a servicemember for receiving a Purple Heart, and whether expanding eligibility does a disservice to those who have already earned the award. The Constitution allows Congress to act in this area, and events have prompted changes regarding eligibility for the Purple Heart. \n\nThe NDAA for FY2015 expanded eligibility by redefining what should be considered an attack by a foreign terrorist organization. As a result, servicemembers wounded and killed in the 2009 shootings in Little Rock, AR, and at Fort Hood, TX, were awarded Purple Hearts in 2015. \n\nThe report also covers the history of the Purple Heart, starting with George Washington's Badge of Military Merit in 1782. It was later revived by MacArthur in 1932. \n\nThere's a lot of legislative changes, like the Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2015. \n\nThe current eligibility criteria are detailed, including various conditions. \n\nThere are ongoing debates about expanding eligibility, especially for invisible wounds like PTSD and TBI. \n\nThe report also mentions legislation to protect the Purple Heart from being sold, like the Private", "answers": ["The Purple Heart is one of the oldest and most recognized American military medals, awarded to servicemembers who were killed or wounded by enemy action. The conflicts 2001 to the present have greatly increased the number of Purple Hearts awarded to servicemembers. Events over the past few years have spurred debate on the eligibility criteria for the Purple Heart. Shootings on U.S. soil and medical conditions such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have prompted changes to the eligibility requirements for the Purple Heart. Some critics believe that these changes may lessen the value of the medal and the sacrifices of past recipients on the battlefield. In the past, efforts to modify the Purple Heart's eligibility requirements were contentious, and veterans groups were vocal concerning eligibility changes. While medal requirements are often left to the military and executive branch to decide, Congress is involved in Purple Heart eligibility, utilizing its constitutional power \"To Make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces\" (U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8, clause 14). The Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (P.L. 113-291) included language that expands eligibility for the Purple Heart. Previous debates have raised several questions about the Purple Heart. In some respects, how an event is defined can determine eligibility: Is a servicemember the victim of a crime or a terrorist attack? Conversely, arguing that killed or wounded servicemembers \"should\" be eligible for the Purple Heart can redefine an event: Is the servicemember an advisor to a foreign military or a combatant? Are PTSD and other mental health conditions adequate injuries to warrant the Purple Heart? These are questions that Congress might consider if it chooses to act on this issue."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4754}
{"pred": " The USDA's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) oversees the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), managing regulations, ensuring state compliance, and authorizing retailers. States handle eligibility, benefit calculations, EBT card issuance, and fraud investigations. SNAP recipients, particularly those aged 16-59, must meet work requirements, including job search, accepting suitable work, and participating in work programs. Exemptions include being a student, caring for a dependent, or working 30+ hours. ABAWDs, a group of working-age adults without dependents, have stricter requirements, such as working 20 hours per week or participating in workfare. These individuals are limited to 3 months of benefits in 36-month period unless a waiver is in place. Work requirements can lead to disqualification if not met. SNAP E&T programs offer flexibility in services, with states choosing between voluntary or mandatory participation. The report highlights the work requirements, the SNAP E&T programs, and the federal funding available for these programs. It also discusses the issue of improper payments in the SNAP program, which is a significant concern for the USDA. The report also addresses the issue of fraud and trafficking by SNAP recipients and retailers.

USDA and the states jointly administer SNAP and partner to address issues that affect program integrity, including improper payments and fraud. GAO has previously reported on various aspects of SNAP, including state SNAP E&T programs, improper payment rates, recipient fraud, and retailer trafficking. This testimony discusses GAO's prior and ongoing work on (1) SNAP E&T programs, including program participants, design, and USDA oversight, and (2) USDA's efforts to address SNAP program integrity, including improper payments, as well as recipient and retailer fraud. As part of its ongoing work on SNAP E&T programs, GAO analyzed E&T expenditures and participation data from fiscal years 2007 through 2016, the most recent data available; reviewed relevant research from USDA; and interviewed USDA and selected state and local officials. The prior work discussed in this testimony is based on four GAO products on E&T programs (GAO-03-388), improper payments (GAO-16-708T), recipient fraud (GAO-14-641), and retailer trafficking (GAO-07-53). Information on the scope and methodology of our prior work is available in each product. Overseen by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and administered by states, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Employment and Training (E&T) programs served about 0.5 percent of the approximately 43.5 million SNAP recipients in an average month of fiscal year 2016, according to the most recent USDA data available. These programs are generally designed to help SNAP recipients increase their ability to obtain regular employment through services such as job search and training. Some recipients may be required to participate. According to USDA, about 14 percent of SNAP recipients were subject to work requirements in an average month of fiscal year 2016, while others, such as children and the elderly, were generally exempt from these requirements. States have flexibility in how they design their E&T programs. Over the last several years, states have 1) increasingly moved away from programs that mandate participation, 2) focused on serving able-bodied adults without dependents whose benefits are generally time-limited unless they comply with work requirements, and 3) partnered with state and local organizations to deliver services. USDA has taken steps to increase support and oversight of SNAP E&T since 2014, including collecting new data on participant outcomes from states. GAO has ongoing work reviewing SNAP E&T programs, including USDA oversight. USDA and the states partner to address issues that affect program integrity, including improper payments and fraud, and USDA has taken some steps to address challenges in these areas, but issues remain. Improper Payments. In 2016, GAO reviewed SNAP improper payment rates and found that states' adoption of program flexibilities and changes in federal SNAP policy in the previous decade, as well as improper payment rate calculation methods, likely affected these rates. Although USDA reported improper payment estimates for SNAP in previous years, USDA did not report an estimate for benefits paid in fiscal years 2015 or 2016 due to data quality issues in some states. USDA has since been working with the states to improve improper payment estimates for the fiscal year 2017 review. Recipient Fraud. In 2014, GAO made recommendations to USDA to address challenges states faced in combatting recipient fraud. For example, GAO found that USDA's guidance on the use of transaction data to uncover potential trafficking lacked specificity and recommended USDA develop additional guidance. Since then, USDA has provided technical assistance to some states, including on the use of data analytics. GAO has ongoing work reviewing states' use of data analytics to identify SNAP recipient fraud. Retailer Trafficking. In 2006, GAO identified several ways in which SNAP was vulnerable to retailer trafficking—a practice involving the exchange of benefits for cash or non-food items. For example, USDA had not conducted analyses to identify high-risk retailers and target its resources. Since then, USDA has established risk levels for retailers based on various factors. GAO has ongoing work assessing how USDA prevents, detects, and responds to retailer trafficking and reviewing the usefulness of USDA's estimates of the extent of SNAP retailer trafficking.

{"pred": " The report discusses the growing interest in liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a maritime fuel due to the combination of increased LNG supply and new regulations requiring less polluting fuels in the international shipping industry. It highlights that while LNG has been used as a secondary fuel in LNG tankers for years, using it as a primary fuel is a newer development, with the first LNG-powered vessel, a Norwegian ferry, starting service in 2000. The report outlines several key points of interest to Congress, including the potential for LNG to reduce harmful air emissions, create a new market for domestic natural gas, and generate economic opportunities in domestic shipbuilding. However, it also notes that U.S. ports would need specialized vessels and land-based infrastructure for LNG bunkering, as well as appropriate regulatory oversight of the associated shipping and fueling operations. The storage, delivery, and use of LNG in shipping also present safety concerns. The report also mentions a bill in the 115th Congress, the Waterway LNG Parity Act of 2017 (S. 505), which would have imposed excise taxes on LNG used by marine vessels on inland waterways. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set standards to limit sulfur emissions from ships, which have led vessel operators to consider alternatives to petroleum-based fuels. The IMO's MARPOL Convention, specifically Annex VI, has established limits on nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and set a 4.5% limit on the allowable sulfur content in vessel fuels. The IMO has announced a timeline to reduce the maximum sulfur content in vessel fuels from 4.5% to 0.5% by January 1, 2020. This has led to the development of LNG bunkering infrastructure. The report also discusses the market conditions in which LNG may compete to become a common bunker fuel for vessel operators, and the current status of LNG bunkering globally and in the United States. The IMO's 2020 standards apply to vessels of 400 gross tons and over, which is estimated to cover about 110,000 vessels worldwide. However, analysts indicate that many of the smaller vessels in this group already burn low-sulfur fuel. Accounting for these smaller vessels, one estimate is that about 55,000 vessels currently burn high-sulfur fuel. Ship owners have two main options for meeting the emission requirements with existing engines: burn low-sulfur conventional fuel (or biofuels)", "answers": ["The combination of growing liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies and new requirements for less polluting fuels in the maritime shipping industry has heightened interest in LNG as a maritime fuel. The use of LNG as an engine (\"bunker\") fuel in shipping is also drawing attention from federal agencies and is beginning to emerge as an issue of interest in Congress. In 2008, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) announced a timeline to reduce the maximum sulfur content in vessel fuels to 0.5% by January 1, 2020. Annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships requires vessels to either use fuels containing less than 0.5% sulfur or install exhaust-cleaning systems (\"scrubbers\") to limit a vessel's airborne emissions of sulfur oxides to an equivalent level. An option for vessel operators to meet the IMO 2020 standards is to install LNG-fueled engines, which emit only trace amounts of sulfur. Adopting LNG engines requires more investment than installing scrubbers, but LNG-fueled engines may offset their capital costs with operating cost advantages over conventional fuels. Savings would depend on the price spread between LNG and fuel oil. Recent trends suggest that LNG may be cheaper in the long run than conventional fuels. LNG bunkering requires specialized infrastructure for supply, storage, and delivery to vessels. To date, the number of ports worldwide that have developed such infrastructure is limited, although growth in this area has accelerated. Early adoption of LNG bunkering is occurring in Europe where the European Union requires a core network of ports to provide LNG bunkering by 2030. LNG bunkering is also advancing in Asia, led by Singapore, the world's largest bunkering port. Asian countries, together with Australia and the United Arab Emirates, have about 10 coastal ports offering LNG bunkering, with another 15 projects in development. LNG bunkering in the United States currently takes place in Jacksonville, FL, and Port Fourchon, LA—with a third facility under development in Tacoma, WA. Bunkering of LNG-fueled cruise ships using barges also is planned for Port Canaveral, FL. The relative locations of other U.S. ports and operating LNG terminals suggest that LNG bunkering could be within reach of every port along the Eastern Seaboard and in the Gulf of Mexico. On the West Coast, the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, CA, are near the Costa Azul LNG terminal in Ensenada, MX. Seattle and Tacoma are adjacent to the proposed Tacoma LNG project. Since 2015, Jones Act coastal ship operators have taken steps to transition their fleets to use cleaner burning fuels, including LNG. Shippers of dry goods to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico have taken delivery or have ordered LNG-fueled and LNG-capable vessels from U.S. shipyards in Philadelphia, PA, and Brownsville, TX. Another company operates five LNG-powered offshore supply vessels built in Gulfport, MS. Depending upon LNG conversions, the global LNG bunker fuel market could grow to several billion dollars by 2030. If U.S. LNG producers were to supply a significant share of this market—on the strength of comparatively low LNG production costs—LNG bunkering could increase demand for U.S. natural gas production, transportation, and liquefaction. Opportunities in LNG-related shipbuilding might be more limited, as most shipbuilding occurs overseas, although domestically-constructed LNG bunkering barges could be one area of economic growth. Finally, engineering and construction firms could benefit from new opportunities to develop port infrastructure for LNG storage and transfer. However, while vessel conversion to LNG fuel may increase demand for U.S.-produced natural gas, it partially could be offset by reduced demand for U.S.-produced crude oil or refined products. Furthermore, while LNG can reduce direct emissions from vessels, fugitive emissions and environmental impacts from natural gas production and transportation could reduce overall emissions benefits. While the LNG industry has experienced few accidents, the Coast Guard has been developing new standards to address unique safety and security risks associated with LNG in vessel operations. The overarching consideration about LNG bunkering in the United States is uncertainty about how the global shipping fleet will adapt to the IMO sulfur standards over time. This uncertainty complicates decisions related to both private investment and public policy. Although Congress has limited ability to influence global shipping, it could influence the growth of LNG bunkering through the tax code and regulation, or through policies affecting the LNG industry or domestic shipping industry as a whole. Evaluating the potential implications of LNG bunkering within the context of broader energy and environmental policies may become an additional consideration for Congress. If LNG bunkering expands significantly, Congress also may examine the adequacy of existing measures to ensure the safety and security of LNG vessels, storage, and related facilities."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8129}
{"pred": " The report provides an overview of the U.S. education system and the issue of lead in school drinking water. It begins by highlighting the scale of the U.S. education system, noting that in the 2014-2015 school year, there were 50.3 million students enrolled in over 98,000 public elementary and secondary schools. These schools are overseen by approximately 16,000 local educational agencies (school districts), which are, in turn, overseen and supported by state educational agencies. The report then delves into the issue of lead in school drinking water, discussing the health risks associated with lead exposure, the regulatory framework, and the current state of testing and remediation efforts by school districts. It outlines the presence of lead in drinking water due to interactions with lead-containing plumbing materials and fixtures within the school buildings. The report highlights that lead is a neurotoxin that can accumulate in the body over time, with long-lasting effects, particularly for children. It notes that lead in drinking water can cause health effects if it enters the bloodstream and causes an elevated blood lead level. Lead in a child's body can slow down growth and development, damage hearing and speech, and lead to learning disabilities. For adults, lead can have detrimental effects on cardiovascular, renal, and reproductive systems and can prompt memory loss. In pregnant women, lead stored in bones can be released as maternal calcium used to form the bones of the fetus, reduce fetal growth, and increase risk of miscarriage and stillbirth. The report also discusses the federal laws and regulations, such as the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR), and the Lead Contamination Control Act (LCCA), which set the standards for drinking water contaminants. It explains that the EPA has the authority to set standards for drinking water contaminants under the SDWA. The report also discusses the EPA's guidance, including the 3Ts guidance, which provides information on training school officials, testing drinking water in schools, and communicating with stakeholders. The report highlights that there is no federal law requiring testing for lead in school drinking water. However, some states have implemented requirements for testing and remediation. The report also discusses the findings of a survey of school districts, which found that about 43 percent of school districts tested for lead in school drinking water, while 41 percent did not test, and 16 percent did not know. The report also discusses the costs and the remediation efforts", "answers": ["No federal law requires testing of drinking water for lead in schools that receive water from public water systems, although these systems are regulated by the EPA. Lead can leach into water from plumbing materials inside a school. The discovery of toxic levels of lead in water in Flint, Michigan, in 2015 has renewed awareness about the danger lead exposure poses to public health, especially for children. GAO was asked to review school practices for lead testing and remediation. This report examines the extent to which (1) school districts are testing for, finding, and remediating lead in drinking water; (2) states are supporting these efforts; and (3) federal agencies are supporting state and school district efforts. GAO administered a web-based survey to a stratified, random sample of 549 school districts, the results of which are generalizable to all school districts. GAO visited or interviewed officials with 17 school districts with experience in lead testing, spread among 5 states, selected for geographic variation. GAO also interviewed federal and state officials and reviewed relevant laws and documents. An estimated 43 percent of school districts, serving 35 million students, tested for lead in school drinking water in 2016 or 2017, according to GAO's nationwide survey of school districts. An estimated 41 percent of school districts, serving 12 million students, had not tested for lead. GAO's survey showed that, among school districts that did test, an estimated 37 percent found elevated lead (lead at levels above their selected threshold for taking remedial action.) (See figure.) All school districts that found elevated lead in drinking water reported taking steps to reduce or eliminate exposure to lead, including replacing water fountains, installing filters or new fixtures, or providing bottled water. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), at least 8 states have requirements that schools test for lead in drinking water as of 2017, and at least 13 additional states supported school districts' voluntary efforts with funding or in-kind support for testing and remediation. In addition, the five states GAO visited provided examples of technical assistance to support testing in schools. EPA provides guidance and other resources to states and school districts regarding testing and remediating lead in drinking water, and the Department of Education (Education) provides some of this information on its websites. School district officials that used EPA's written guidance said they generally found it helpful. Although EPA guidance emphasizes the importance of addressing elevated lead levels, GAO found that some aspects of the guidance, such as the threshold for taking remedial action, were potentially misleading and unclear, which can put school districts at risk of making uninformed decisions. In addition, many school districts reported a lack of familiarity with EPA's guidance, and their familiarity varied by region of the country. Education and EPA do not regularly collaborate to support state and school district efforts on lead in drinking water, despite agreeing to do so in a 2005 memorandum of understanding. Such collaboration could encourage testing and ensure that more school districts will have the necessary information to limit student and staff exposure to lead. GAO is making seven recommendations, including that EPA update its guidance on how schools should determine lead levels requiring action and for EPA and Education to collaborate to further disseminate guidance and encourage testing for lead.

The report outlines the legal framework for OTs, including the statutory provisions in 10 U.S.C. 2371, 2371b, and 2373. It also discusses the various applications of OTs, such as conducting research, developing prototypes, and contracting for follow-on production.\n\nOTs are legally binding contracts that are generally exempt from federal procurement laws and regulations such as the Competition in Contracting Act, the Truth in Negotiations Act, the Cost Accounting Standards, the Contract Disputes Act, and the Bayh-Dole Act. However, the lack of authoritative data makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of OTs. The report also highlights the potential for OTs to promote innovation and strengthen the defense industrial base. \n\nThe report discusses the potential for OTs to promote innovation and strengthen the defense industrial base. It also raises concerns about the potential for OTs to be used to circumvent the statutory and regulatory framework and to avoid the competition and to circumvent the oversight and to promote the accountability and to prevent the waste, fraud, and abuse. The report concludes that the use of OTs is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and that Congress should consider the potential for further reporting and for the data collection and for the data analysis.\n\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report. Let me read through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report is about the Department of Defense's use of Other Transactions (OTs) to acquire", "answers": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) obligates more than $300 billion annually to buy goods and services, and to support research and development. Most of these acquisitions are governed by procurement statutes and regulations found in Title 10 (and parts of other select titles) of the United States Code, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement. Under certain circumstances, DOD can enter into an other transaction (OT) agreement instead of a traditional contract. OT agreements are generally exempt from federal procurement laws and regulations. These exemptions grant government officials the flexibility to include, amend, or exclude contract clauses and requirements that are mandatory in traditional procurements (e.g., termination clauses, cost accounting standards, payments, audit requirements, intellectual property, and contract disputes). OT authorities also grant more flexibility to structure agreements in numerous ways, including joint ventures; partnerships; consortia; or multiple agencies joining together to fund an agreement encompassing multiple providers. Other transaction agreements are legally binding contracts; they are referred to as agreements to distinguish them from the traditional procurement contracts governed by the FAR and procurements laws. Other transaction authorities are set forth in two sections of law: 10 U.S.C. 2371—granting authority to use OTs for basic, applied, and advanced research projects. 10 U.S.C. 2371b—granting authority to use OTs for prototype projects and follow-on production. Under this authority, a prototype project can only be conducted if at least one nontraditional defense contractor significantly participates in the project; all significant participants are small businesses or nontraditional defense contractors; at least one-third of the total cost of the prototype project is provided by nongovernment participants; or the senior procurement acquisition official provides a written justification for using an OT. Follow-on production can only be conducted when the underlying prototype OT was competitively awarded, and the prototype project was successfully completed. OTs have the potential to provide significant benefits to DOD, including attracting nontraditional contractors with promising technological capabilities to work with DOD, establishing a mechanism to pool resources with other entities to facilitate development of, and obtain, state-of-the-art dual-use technologies, and offering a unique mechanism for DOD to invest in, and influence the direction of, technology development. A number of analysts warn that along with the potential benefits come significant risks, including potentially diminished oversight and exemption from laws and regulations designed to protect government and taxpayer interests. In FY2017, DOD obligated $2.1 billion on prototype OT agreements, representing less than 1% of contract obligations for the year. However, the use of OTs is expected to grow at a rapid pace, due in part to recent statutory changes expanding other transaction authorities. A number of analysts and officials have raised concerns that if DOD uses OTs in ways not intended by Congress—or is perceived to abuse the authority—Congress could clamp down on the authority. Generally, DOD lacks authoritative data that can be used to measure and evaluate the use of other transaction authorities."], "all_classes": null, "length": 14640}
{"pred": " The report addresses the growing concerns over data privacy and protection in the United States, highlighting the inadequacies of current federal laws and the need for a more comprehensive data protection framework. It begins by discussing the increasing frequency and variety of internet connectivity, which has led to the transmission of personal data at an exponential rate. This has resulted in the collection, maintenance, and use of personal information by both consumer-facing entities (such as websites) and behind-the-scenes actors (such as data brokers and advertising companies). The report notes that while some data protection laws exist, they are often sector-specific and do not provide a uniform standard. The legal framework is complex and technical, and lacks uniformity at the federal level. The Supreme Court has recognized that the Constitution provides various rights protecting individual privacy, but these rights generally guard only against government intrusions and do little to prevent private actors from abusing personal data online. At the federal level, while there are a number of data protection statutes, they primarily regulate certain industries and subcategories of data. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) fills in some of the statutory gaps by enforcing the federal prohibition against unfair and deceptive data protection practices. However, no single federal law comprehensively regulates the collection and use of personal data. In contrast, the EU and some other countries have enacted more comprehensive data protection legislation, such as the GDPR. The report also discusses the current legal landscape, including the common law and constitutional rights, and the various federal statutes. It explains that the common law and constitutional rights focus on government intrusions rather than on protecting private individuals from private actors. The report highlights the need for a more comprehensive federal data protection policy, but there is no consensus on the role of the federal government in data protection. The report also examines the potential legal considerations for the 116th Congress should it consider creating a more comprehensive federal data protection legislation. The report concludes that the current U.S. legal framework is complex and highly technical, but so too are the legal issues implicated by proposals to create a unified federal data protection policy. The report also discusses the need for a more comprehensive federal data protection policy, but some have criticized the EU's and California's approach to data protection. The report suggests that Congress should consider creating a more comprehensive federal data protection legislation, but there is no consensus on the role of the federal government in data protection.

Intentional intrusions into government and private computer networks and inadequate corporate privacy and cybersecurity practices have exposed the personal information of millions of Americans to unwanted recipients. At the same time, internet connectivity has increased and varied in form in recent years. Americans now transmit their personal data on the internet at an exponentially higher rate than in the past, and their data are collected, cultivated, and maintained by a growing number of both \"consumer facing\" and \"behind the scenes\" actors such as data brokers. As a consequence, the privacy, cybersecurity and protection of personal data have emerged as a major issue for congressional consideration. Despite the rise in interest in data protection, the legislative paradigms governing cybersecurity and data privacy are complex and technical, and lack uniformity at the federal level. The constitutional \"right to privacy\" developed over the course of the 20th century, but this right generally guards only against government intrusions and does little to shield the average internet user from private actors. At the federal statutory level, there are a number of statutes that protect individuals' personal data or concern cybersecurity, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, and others. And a number of different agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), enforce these laws. But these statutes primarily regulate certain industries and subcategories of data. The FTC fills in some of the statutory gaps by enforcing a broad prohibition against unfair and deceptive data protection practices. But no single federal law comprehensively regulates the collection and use of consumers' personal data. Seeking a more fulsome data protection system, some governments—such as California and the European Union (EU)—have recently enacted privacy laws regulating nearly all forms of personal data within their jurisdictional reach. Some argue that Congress should consider creating similar protections in federal law, but others have criticized the EU and California approaches as being overly prescriptive and burdensome. Should the 116th Congress consider a comprehensive federal data protection law, its legislative proposals may involve numerous decision points and legal considerations. Points of consideration may include the conceptual framework of the law (i.e., whether it is prescriptive or outcome-based), the scope of the law and its definition of protected information, and the role of the FTC or other federal enforcement agency. Further, if Congress wants to allow individuals to enforce data protection laws and seek remedies for the violations of such laws in court, it must account for standing requirements in Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution. Federal preemption also raises complex legal questions—not only of whether to preempt state law, but what form of preemption Congress should employ. Finally, from a First Amendment perspective, Supreme Court jurisprudence suggests that while some privacy, cybersecurity, or data security regulations are permissible, any federal law that restricts protected speech, particularly if it targets specific speakers or content, may be subject to more stringent review by a reviewing court."], "all_classes": null, "length": 18048}
{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report about the 2020 Census cost estimate. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report is from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and discusses the reliability of the Census Bureau's life-cycle cost estimate for the 2020 Census. The main points seem to be that the Bureau has struggled to produce reliable cost estimates in the past, leading to issues like cost overruns and being designated a high-risk area. They mention that reliable cost estimates are crucial for budgeting, planning, and managing federal programs. The report outlines four characteristics that a reliable cost estimate must meet: comprehensive, well-documented, accurate, and credible. \n\nIn 2015, the Bureau estimated the cost at $12.3 billion, but by 2017, that had increased to $15.6 billion. The 2017 estimate was found to partially meet some of the criteria, but not fully. The main issue was with the \"well-documented\" characteristic. The Bureau has made some improvements, like establishing a standardized WBS, but still needs to address the documentation issues. \n\nThe report also talks about the Bureau's efforts to improve their cost estimation processes, including the development of guidance, policies, and procedures. They conducted sensitivity analysis, and performed risk and uncertainty analysis. They also compared their estimate with two independent cost estimates. The Bureau also mentioned that they have used tools to generate the cost estimate. \n\nWait, the report mentions that the 2010 Census cost estimate was not reliable, leading to a high-risk designation. Then in 2016, the 2015 estimate was not reliable, leading to another high-risk designation. The 2017 estimate was found to partially meet some of the characteristics, but not all. The Bureau has agreed to take steps to improve the reliability of the cost estimate, but the report says that the 2017 estimate is not reliable because it only partially met the well-documented criteria. \n\nSo the key points are: the Bureau has had issues with their cost estimates, leading to high-risk status. They've made progress, but the documentation is still lacking. The report also discusses the reasons for the cost increases, like lower self-response rates and higher IT costs. \n\nThe Bureau", "answers": ["In October 2017, the Department of Commerce (Commerce) announced that the projected life-cycle cost of the 2020 Census had climbed to $15.6 billion, a more than $3 billion (27 percent) increase over its 2015 estimate. A high-quality, reliable cost estimate is a key tool for budgeting, planning, and managing the 2020 Census. Without this capability, the Bureau is at risk of experiencing program cost overruns, missed deadlines, and performance shortfalls. GAO was asked to evaluate the reliability of the Bureau's life-cycle cost estimate. This report evaluates the reliability of the Bureau's revised life-cycle cost estimate for the 2020 Census and the extent to which the Bureau is using it as a management tool, and compares the 2015 and 2017 cost estimates to describe key drivers of cost growth. GAO reviewed documentary and testimonial evidence from Bureau officials responsible for developing the 2020 Census cost estimate and used its cost assessment guide ( GAO-09-3SP ) as criteria. Since 2015, the Census Bureau (Bureau) has made significant progress in improving its ability to develop a reliable cost estimate. While improvements have been made, the Bureau's October 2017 cost estimate for the 2020 Census does not fully reflect all the characteristics of a reliable estimate. (See figure.) Specifically, for the characteristic of being well-documented, GAO found that some of the source data either did not support the information described in the cost estimate or was not in the files provided for two of its largest field operations. In GAO's assessment of the 2015 version of the 2020 Census cost estimate, GAO recommended that the Bureau take steps to ensure that each of the characteristics of a reliable cost estimate is met. The Bureau agreed and has taken steps, but has not fully implemented this recommendation. A reliable cost estimate serves as a tool for program development and oversight, helping management make informed decisions. During this review, GAO found the Bureau used the cost estimate to inform decision making. Factors that contributed to cost fluctuations between the 2015 and 2017 cost estimates include: Changes in assumptions. Among other changes, a decrease in the assumed rate for self-response from 63.5 percent in 2015 to 60.5 percent in 2017 increased the cost of collecting responses from nonresponding housing units. Improved ability to anticipate and quantify risk. In general, contingency allocations designed to address the effects of potential risks increased overall from $1.3 billion in 2015 to $2.6 billion in 2017. An overall increase in information technology (IT) costs. IT cost increases, totaling $1.59 billion, represented almost 50 percent of the total cost increase from 2015 to 2017. GAO is not making any new recommendations but maintains its earlier recommendation—that the Secretary of Commerce direct the Bureau to take specific steps to ensure its cost estimate meets the characteristics of a high-quality estimate. In its response to this report, Commerce generally agreed with the findings related to cost estimation improvements, but disagreed that the cost estimate was not reliable. However, until GAO's recommendation is fully implemented the cost estimate cannot be considered reliable."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6712}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report about congressional salaries. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report starts by mentioning the Constitution's Article I, Section 6, which states that Congress members' salaries are determined by law and paid from the U.S. Treasury. Then there's the Twenty-Seventh Amendment, which prevents salary changes from taking effect until after an election of Representatives. This amendment was proposed in 1789 but wasn't ratified until 1992. \n\nSince FY1983, salaries have been in a permanent appropriations account. The last pay raise was in 2009, with most members earning $174,000. Exceptions are the Speaker, President pro tempore, and leaders. The report includes historical data on salaries since 1789, details on legislation that prohibits automatic annual pay adjustments, comparisons between projected and actual adjustments, and member pay in constant and current dollars since 1992. \n\nThere are three methods to adjust member pay. First, specific legislation. Second, recommendations from the President based on quadrennial salary commission. Third, annual adjustments based on the ECI. The Ethics Reform Act of 1989 changed the method of annual adjustment. The annual adjustment is automatic unless Congress enacts a law to prohibit it, or the GS base pay adjustment is lower than the scheduled adjustment. \n\nThe report also discusses how pay adjustments are sometimes included in appropriations bills, but not always. There have been several attempts to pass legislation that would freeze or reduce pay for members of Congress. \n\nThe report provides tables and figures showing salary changes over time, including the impact of the Twenty-Seventh Amendment. It also mentions that since 2009, salaries have been frozen, leading to a decrease in real terms when adjusted for inflation. \n\nI need to condense all this into a one-page summary. Let me structure it with an introduction, key points about the amendment, salary adjustments, historical data, and the impact of inflation. Also, mention the methods of adjusting pay and the legislative attempts to freeze or reduce pay. \n\nWait, the user wants a one-page summary, so I need to be concise. Let me start with the main points: the Constitution's provision on pay, the Twenty-Seventh Amendment's ratification, salary adjustments over time, the role of the Ethics Reform Act, and the effect of inflation", "answers": ["Congress is required by Article I, Section 6, of the Constitution to determine its own pay. In the past, Congress periodically enacted specific legislation to alter its pay; the last time this occurred affected pay in 1991. More recently, pay has been determined pursuant to laws establishing formulas for automatic adjustments. The Ethics Reform Act of 1989 established the current automatic annual adjustment formula, which is based on changes in private sector wages as measured by the Employment Cost Index (ECI). The adjustment is automatic unless denied statutorily, although the percentage may not exceed the percentage base pay increase for General Schedule (GS) employees. Member pay has since been frozen in two ways: (1) directly, through legislation that freezes salaries for Members but not for other federal employees, and (2) indirectly, through broader pay freeze legislation that covers Members and other specified categories of federal employees. Members of Congress last received a pay adjustment in January 2009. At that time, their salary was increased 2.8%, to $174,000. A provision in P.L. 111-8 prohibited any pay adjustment for 2010. Under the pay adjustment formula, Members were originally scheduled to receive an adjustment in January 2010 of 2.1%, although this would have been revised downward automatically to 1.5% to match the GS base pay adjustment. Members next were scheduled to receive a 0.9% pay adjustment in 2011. The pay adjustment was prohibited by P.L. 111-165. Additionally, P.L. 111-322 prevented any adjustment in GS base pay before December 31, 2012. Since the percentage adjustment in Member pay may not exceed the percentage adjustment in the base pay of GS employees, Member pay was also frozen during this period. If not limited by GS pay, Member pay could have been adjusted by 1.3% in 2012. The ECI formula established a maximum potential pay adjustment in January 2013 of 1.1%. P.L. 112-175 extended the freeze on GS pay rates for the duration of this continuing resolution, which also extended the Member freeze since the percentage adjustment in Member pay may not exceed the percentage adjustment in GS base pay. Subsequently, Member pay for 2013 was further frozen in P.L. 112-240. The maximum potential 2014 pay adjustment of 1.2%, or $2,100, was denied by P.L. 113-46. The maximum potential January 2015 Member pay adjustment was 1.6%, or $2,800. President Obama proposed a 1.0% increase in the base pay of GS employees, which would automatically have limited any Member pay adjustment to 1.0%. P.L. 113-235 contained a provision prohibiting any Member pay adjustment. The maximum potential January 2016 pay adjustment of 1.7%, or $3,000, would have been limited to 1.0%, or $1,700, due to the GS base pay increase. Member pay for 2016 was frozen by P.L. 114-113. The maximum potential January 2017 pay adjustment of 1.6%, or $2,800, would have been limited to 1.0%, or $1,700, due to the GS base pay increase. Member pay for 2017 was frozen by P.L. 114-254. The maximum potential January 2018 pay adjustment of 1.8%, or $3,100, was automatically limited to 1.4%, or $2,400, before being frozen by P.L. 115-141. The maximum potential January 2019 pay adjustment of 2.3%, or $4,000, was automatically limited to 1.4%, or $2,400, before being frozen at the 2009 level by P.L. 115-244. The maximum potential January 2020 pay adjustment is 2.6%, or $4,500. If Members of Congress had received every adjustment prescribed by the ECI formula since 1992, and the 2 U.S.C. §4501 limitation regarding the percentage base pay increase for GS employees remained unchanged, the 2019 salary would be $210,900. When adjusted for inflation, Member salaries have decreased 15% since the last pay adjustment in 2009. Both the automatic annual adjustments and funding for Members' salaries are provided pursuant to other laws (2 U.S.C. §4501)—not the annual appropriations bills—and a provision prohibiting a scheduled adjustment could be included in any bill, or introduced as a separate bill."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5069}
{"pred": " The Department of Defense (DOD) has established policies to address unwanted sexual behaviors, including sexual assault, sexual harassment, and domestic violence. Sexual assault is defined as intentional sexual contact using force, threats, intimidation, abuse of authority, or when the victim does not or cannot consent. Sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, when submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of a person’s job, pay, or career; submission to or rejection of such conduct by a person is used as a basis for career or employment decisions affecting that person; or such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment. However, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY 2017 changed the definition of sexual harassment for the military for purposes of investigations by commanding officers so that it is no longer defined solely as a form of sex discrimination but is recognized also as an adverse behavior on the spectrum of behavior that can contribute to an increase in the incidence of sexual assault. Domestic violence is defined as an offense under the United States Code, the Uniform Code of Military Justice, or state law involving the use, attempted use, or threatened use of force or violence against a person, or a violation of a lawful order issued for the protection of a person who is a current or former spouse, a person with whom the abuser shares a child in common, or a current or former intimate partner with whom the abuser shares or has shared a common domicile. Sexual assault of spouses and intimate partners is a subset of domestic violence. The DOD has various offices and organizations that play a role in addressing unwanted sexual behaviors in the military. The Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness is responsible for developing the overall policy and guidance for the department’s efforts to prevent and respond to instances of sexual assault, except for criminal investigative policy matters assigned to the DOD Inspector General and legal processes in the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness oversees the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO), which serves as the department’s single point of authority, accountability, and oversight for its sexual assault prevention and response program. The responsibilities of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness and SAPRO with regard to sexual assault prevention and response include providing guidance and technical support to the military services, facilitating the identification", "answers": ["Unwanted sexual behaviors in the military—including sexual harassment, sexual assault, and domestic violence involving sexual assault—undermine core values, unit cohesion, combat readiness, and public goodwill. Recent studies suggest that these behaviors are part of a “continuum of harm,” which DOD defines as a range of interconnected, inappropriate behaviors that are connected to the occurrence of sexual assault and that support an environment that tolerates these behaviors. Senate Report 114-255 included a provision for GAO to review efforts by DOD to prevent unwanted sexual behaviors in the military. GAO assessed the extent to which DOD has (1) policies on sexual harassment that include CDC principles and relevant legislative elements; (2) processes for maintaining and reporting consistent data on incidents of unwanted sexual behaviors; and (3) overarching efforts, including a prevention strategy, to address unwanted sexual behaviors across the continuum of harm. GAO reviewed DOD policies and pertinent databases, and interviewed agency officials. The Department of Defense's (DOD) policies on sexual harassment include some but not all of the Centers for Disease Control's (CDC) principles for preventing sexual violence and include most relevant legislative elements. GAO identified six principles from CDC's framework for preventing sexual violence, which CDC defines as including sexual harassment. GAO found that Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and military service policies generally include CDC's principles regarding prevention strategies, but none address risk and protective factors, which identify conditions or behaviors that might heighten or lower the risk of sexual harassment victimization or perpetration, respectively. Additionally, a statutory provision in fiscal year 2013 mandated that DOD, among other things, develop a comprehensive sexual harassment policy that includes prevention training, mechanisms for anonymous reporting, and mechanisms for resolving incidents of sexual harassment. OSD and service policies are generally consistent with those required elements except for the inclusion of anonymous reporting. DOD is developing a new department-wide policy that will address sexual harassment, but it is too early to determine how the policy will address these issues. Without policies that include CDC's principles and mechanisms for anonymous reporting, DOD may miss opportunities to address and potentially reduce incidents of unwanted sexual behaviors. Finally, a statutory change in fiscal year 2017 redefined sexual harassment for certain purposes so it is no longer defined solely as a form of sex discrimination but is recognized also as an adverse behavior on the spectrum of behavior that can contribute to an increase in the incidence of sexual assault. While officials indicated a need to update policies, they were unclear on the full implications, if any, of this change. DOD has processes for maintaining and reporting consistent data on incidents of unwanted sexual behaviors including sexual assault and incidents of domestic violence that involve sexual assault, but does not have similar processes for maintaining and reporting data on incidents of sexual harassment. Specifically, DOD uses centralized databases to maintain and report data on incidents of sexual assault and domestic violence that involve sexual assault, but relies on military service-specific databases for information on incidents of sexual harassment. DOD has not established standard data elements and definitions to guide the services in maintaining and reporting data on sexual harassment. Inconsistencies in data elements and definitions generally mean that one service may be maintaining data that is more or less detailed than, or that differs from, the data maintained by other services. Such inconsistencies may create difficulties in reporting department-wide sexual harassment data, since the individual service data must be adapted to fit reporting requirements. DOD has several overarching efforts to address unwanted sexual behaviors across the continuum of harm, including developing an overarching prevention strategy. However, it is unclear whether the strategy under development will contain key elements for long-term and results-oriented strategic planning such as long-term goals, strategies to achieve goals, and metrics to gauge progress. Without incorporating these elements into its overarching prevention strategy, DOD may not be in a position to effectively coordinate and integrate prevention activities and reduce instances of unwanted sexual behaviors. GAO recommends that DOD fully include in its new policy on sexual harassment CDC's principles for sexual violence prevention and mechanisms for anonymous reporting, develop standard data elements and definitions for reporting sexual harassment incidents, and incorporate in its overarching prevention strategy elements key for a long-term, results-oriented strategy.

In addition, the component is responsible for safeguarding the nation's currency and financial payment systems. The Secret Service has a workforce of approximately 7,100 employees, including the Uniformed Division, special agents, and administrative, professional, and technical staff. These employees are assigned to the component’s headquarters in Washington, D.C., and 133 field offices located throughout the world (including 115 domestic offices and 18 international offices). The Secret Service's IT infrastructure and communications systems are heavily relied upon to perform their daily duties. According to data reported on the Office of Management and Budget’s IT Dashboard, the component planned to spend about $104.8 million on IT in fiscal year 2018, which included approximately $34.6 million for the development and modernization of its IT infrastructure and services, and about $70.2 million for the operations and maintenance of this infrastructure (including 21 existing IT systems). The Secret Service has faced long-standing challenges in managing its IT infrastructure. For example, a National Security Agency audit of the Secret Service's IT environment in 2008 identified network and system vulnerabilities that needed immediate remediation to protect the component’s systems and electronic information. The Secret Service has implemented the Information Integration and Technology Transformation (IITT) investment, which is intended to modernize and enhance the component’s infrastructure, communications systems, applications, and processes.

To accomplish its mission, the Secret Service relies heavily on the use of IT infrastructure and systems. In 2009, the component initiated the IITT investment—a portfolio of programs and projects that are intended to, among other things, improve systems availability and security in support of the component's business operations. GAO was asked to review the Secret Service's oversight of its IT portfolio and workforce. This report discusses the extent to which the (1) CIO implemented selected IT oversight responsibilities, (2) Secret Service implemented leading IT workforce planning and management practices, and (3) Secret Service and DHS implemented selected performance monitoring practices for IITT. GAO assessed agency documentation against 14 selected component CIO responsibilities established in DHS policy; 15 selected leading workforce planning and management practices within 5 topic areas; and two selected leading industry project monitoring practices that, among other things, were, in GAO's professional judgment, of most significance to managing IITT. The U.S. Secret Service (Secret Service) Chief Information Officer (CIO) fully implemented 11 of 14 selected information technology (IT) oversight responsibilities, and partially implemented the remaining 3. The CIO partially implemented the responsibilities to establish a process that ensures the Secret Service reviews IT contracts; ensure that the component's IT policies align with the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) policies; and set incremental targets to monitor program progress. Additional efforts to fully implement these 3 responsibilities will further position the CIO to effectively manage the IT portfolio. Of the 15 selected practices within the 5 workforce planning and management areas, the Secret Service fully implemented 3 practices, partly implemented 8, and did not implement 4 (see table). Within the strategic planning area, the component partly implemented the practice to, among other things, develop IT competency needs. While the Secret Service had defined general core competencies for its workforce, the Office of the CIO (OCIO) did not identify all of the technical competencies needed to support its functions. As a result, the office was limited in its ability to address any IT competency gaps that may exist. Also, while work remains to improve morale across the component, the Secret Service substantially implemented the employee morale practices for its IT staff. Secret Service officials said the gaps in implementing the workforce practices were due to, among other things, their focus on reorganizing the IT workforce within OCIO. Until the Secret Service fully implements these practices for its IT workforce, it may be limited in its ability to ensure the timely and effective acquisition and maintenance of the component's IT infrastructure and services. Of the two selected IT project monitoring practices, DHS and the Secret Service fully implemented the first practice to monitor the performance of the Information Integration and Technology Transformation (IITT) investment. In addition, for the second practice—to monitor projects on incremental development metrics—the Secret Service fully implemented the practice on one of IITT's projects and partially implemented it on another.

{"pred": " The report examines patterns in school discipline, challenges faced by school districts, and actions taken by the Department of Education (Education) and the Department of Justice (Justice) to address disparities and discrimination in student discipline. Key findings include disproportionate disciplinary actions against Black students, boys, and students with disabilities, regardless of school poverty level or type of school. Implicit bias among educators, such as stereotypes or unconscious associations, may lead to differential treatment of students based on race and gender. Studies indicate that teachers and staff sometimes have discretion in deciding whether to discipline and the form of discipline, which can result in certain groups being disciplined more harshly. For example, Black girls are disproportionately disciplined for subjective interpretations of behaviors, such as disobedience and disruption. Eye-tracking technology has shown that teachers gaze longer at Black boys than other children when asked to look for challenging behavior based on video clips. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) reported that this implicit bias is a contributing factor in school discipline disparities, even though the study did not find that teacher gazes were indicative of how they would discipline students. Children's behavior in school may be affected by health and social challenges outside the classroom that tend to be more acute for poor children, including minority children who experience higher rates of poverty. Research shows that experiencing trauma in childhood may lead to educational challenges, such as lower grades and more suspensions and expulsions; increased use of mental health services; and increased involvement with the child welfare and juvenile justice systems, according to HHS’s Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Additionally, there has been an increase in certain mental health issues among school-age populations. For example, from 2005 to 2014, the suicide rate of youth ages 15 to 19 rose slightly, with older youth having a much higher rate of suicide than younger youth, and since 2007, the percentage of youth ages 12-17 experiencing a major depressive episode increased. In the 2013-14 school year, about 50 million students were enrolled in K-12 public schools, with nearly 90 percent attending traditional public schools. The number of boys and girls was almost evenly split. Nearly half of all public school students had disabilities. About half of all public school students went to schools where 50 percent or more of the students were low-income, and about a quarter went to schools where 75 percent or more of the students were low-income.", "answers": ["Research has shown that students who experience discipline that removes them from the classroom are more likely to repeat a grade, drop out of school, and become involved in the juvenile justice system. Studies have shown this can result in decreased earning potential and added costs to society, such as incarceration and lost tax revenue. Education and Justice are responsible for enforcing federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination in the administration of discipline in public schools. GAO was asked to review the use of discipline in schools. To provide insight into these issues, this report examines (1) patterns in disciplinary actions among public schools, (2) challenges selected school districts reported with student behavior and how they are approaching school discipline, and (3) actions Education and Justice have taken to identify and address disparities or discrimination in school discipline. GAO analyzed discipline data from nearly all public schools for school year 2013-14 from Education's Civil Rights Data Collection; interviewed federal and state officials, as well as officials from a total of 5 districts and 19 schools in California, Georgia, Massachusetts, North Dakota, and Texas. We selected these districts based on disparities in suspensions for Black students, boys, or students with disabilities, and diversity in size and location. We also reviewed federal laws and a non-generalizable sample of seven recently resolved federal school discipline investigations (selected in part based on the type of alleged discrimination). We incorporated technical comments from the agencies as appropriate. Black students, boys, and students with disabilities were disproportionately disciplined (e.g., suspensions and expulsions) in K-12 public schools, according to GAO's analysis of Department of Education (Education) national civil rights data for school year 2013-14, the most recent available. These disparities were widespread and persisted regardless of the type of disciplinary action, level of school poverty, or type of public school attended. For example, Black students accounted for 15.5 percent of all public school students, but represented about 39 percent of students suspended from school—an overrepresentation of about 23 percentage points (see figure). Officials GAO interviewed in all five school districts in the five states GAO visited reported various challenges with addressing student behavior, and said they were considering new approaches to school discipline. They described a range of issues, some complex—such as the effects of poverty and mental health issues. For example, officials in four school districts described a growing trend of behavioral challenges related to mental health and trauma. While there is no one-size-fits-all solution for the issues that influence student behavior, officials from all five school districts GAO visited were implementing alternatives to disciplinary actions that remove children from the classroom, such as initiatives that promote positive behavioral expectations for students. Education and the Department of Justice (Justice) documented several actions taken to identify and address school discipline issues. For example, both agencies investigated cases alleging discrimination. Further, to help identify persistent disparities among the nation's schools, Education collects comprehensive data on school discipline every other year through its Civil Rights Data Collection effort."], "all_classes": null, "length": 11834}
{"pred": " (One page, double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report. Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. \n\nThe report talks about federal land ownership in the U.S., right? It mentions that the federal government owns about 640 million acres, which is more than a quarter of the country's total land. That's a lot. The lands are mostly in the western states, like Alaska, and the federal government owns about half of the land in those areas. \n\nThen there are four agencies: NPS, FWS, BLM, and FS. They manage about 95% of those federal lands. The report explains that no single law gives these agencies the authority to acquire or dispose of lands. Instead, Congress has provided various authorities over time. Each agency has different levels of authority. \n\nThe BLM has broad authority for both acquisitions and disposals. NPS has no general authority to acquire new park units or dispose of park lands. The FS has limited authority to acquire lands, mostly within or contiguous to national forest boundaries. They have some disposal authorities, but they are constrained. The FWS has various authorities to acquire lands but no general authority to dispose of its lands. \n\nThe report goes into detail about the different authorities for each agency. For example, the NPS can only acquire lands if Congress authorizes it. The FS can acquire lands within or contiguous to national forest boundaries. The FWS can acquire lands but not dispose. \n\nThe report also discusses recent legislative proposals, such as those in the 115th Congress, which aim to modify or eliminate certain authorities. There are also provisions for specific land acquisitions or disposals. \n\nThe funding sources for land acquisition are mentioned, like the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). The LWCF's funding expired in 2018, and Congress has to decide the annual appropriation. \n\nThe summary needs to be concise, one page, double-spaced. I need to highlight the key points: federal land ownership, the agencies involved, their authorities, the legislative considerations, and funding sources. \n\nI should start by stating the total federal land ownership, mention the concentration in western states, list the agencies, their acquisition and disposal authorities, and the legislative and funding aspects. Also, note the controversies around federal land management and the recent legislative proposals. \n\nI need to make sure the summary is clear", "answers": ["The federal government owns roughly 640 million acres, heavily concentrated in 12 western states. Four agencies—the National Park Service (NPS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the Department of the Interior, and the U.S. Forest Service (FS) in the Department of Agriculture—administer about 95% of those lands. The extent to which each of these four federal agencies have authority to acquire and dispose of land varies considerably. The BLM has relatively broad authority for both acquisitions and disposals under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA). The agency also has other authorities for disposing of land, including two laws that allow the agency to retain the proceeds for subsequent land acquisition, among other purposes, and a law that allows transfers to governmental units and other entities for public purposes. By contrast, the NPS has no general authority to acquire land to create new park units or to dispose of park lands. The FS authority to acquire lands is mostly limited to lands within or contiguous to the boundaries of a national forest. The agency has various authorities to dispose of land, but they are relatively constrained and infrequently used. The FWS has various authorities to acquire lands but no general authority to dispose of its lands. The agency frequently uses acquisition authority under the Migratory Bird Conservation Act of 1929 because of the availability of funding through the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund. The nature of the acquisition and disposal authorities of the four federal agencies also varies. In general, the acquisition authorities are designed to allow the four agencies to bring into federal ownership lands that many contend could benefit from federal management. Disposal authorities generally are designed to allow agencies to convey land that is no longer needed for a federal purpose or that might be chiefly valuable for another purpose. Some of the authorities specify particular circumstances where they can be used, such as the conveyance of FS land for educational purposes and the disposal of BLM land for recreation and public purposes. Congress often faces questions on the adequacy of existing acquisition and disposal authorities; the nature, extent, and location of their use; and the extent of federal land ownership overall. The current acquisition and disposal authorities form the backdrop for consideration of measures to establish, modify, or eliminate authorities, or to provide for the acquisition or disposal of particular lands. In some cases, Congress enacts bills to provide authority to acquire or dispose of particular parcels where no standing authority exists and, in other cases, to direct or facilitate land transactions. Congress also addresses acquisition and disposal policy in the context of debates on the role and goals of the federal government in owning and managing land generally, and it has considered broader measures to dispose of lands or to promote acquisition. Other issues for Congress pertain to the sources and levels of funds for land acquisition. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is the primary source of funding for land acquisition. Congress has considered diverse measures related to the LWCF, such as legislation to make LWCF funding permanent and bills to direct LWCF monies to additional, nonacquisition purposes. Additionally, the FWS has the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund, an account with mandatory spending authority supported by revenue from three sources. The BLM also has mandatory spending authorities that allow the proceeds from land sales to be used for land acquisition, among other purposes."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4882}

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report is pretty lengthy, so I need to identify the main ideas. The first part talks about the complexity of House rules, but there are two reasons why understanding them isn't as hard as it seems. The first reason is predictability in procedures, even though some rules are complex. The second reason is the principle that a majority can prevail, so minority can't filibuster or delay. Then there's the constitutional basis, Article I, which allows the House to set its own rules. The House can amend rules unilaterally, and suspend or ignore them. The Speaker doesn't enforce rules unless Members make points of order. \n\nThen there are debate limitations, like the one-hour rule, but in practice, the majority manager controls the time, and the minority manager gets part of the time. Also, the House uses different modes of consideration for bills, like suspension of the rules, which has specific time limits and requires a two-thirds vote. \n\nThe Committee of the Whole is a key part where most major bills are debated and amended. The rules for this committee are more flexible. There's a special role for the majority and minority managers. Also, there's mention of special rules reported by the Rules Committee that set procedural ground rules for considering a bill. These can be open, modified open, or closed rules. \n\nThen there's the part about conference committees and resolving differences between the House and Senate. Also, the report includes references to various CRS reports and other resources for further reading.\n\nSo, the summary needs to capture the structure of the report, the key points about the rules, the predictability, the majority principle, the constitutional basis, the different modes of consideration, the role of the Committee of the Whole, and the process for resolving differences between the two chambers. Also, the report mentions the size of the rulebook, the precedents, and the special rules. \n\nI should structure the summary into sections: introduction, the two reasons for understanding the procedures, the constitutional basis, the modes of consideration, the role of the Committee of the Whole, and the process for resolving differences. Also, mention the resources like the House manual, precedents, and the House Practice guide. \n\nI need to keep it concise, one", "answers": ["The daily order of business on the floor of the House of Representatives is governed by standing rules that make certain matters and actions privileged for consideration. On a day-to-day basis, however, the House can also decide to grant individual bills privileged access to the floor, using one of several parliamentary mechanisms. The standing rules of the House include several different parliamentary mechanisms that the body may use to act on bills and resolutions. Which of these will be employed in a given instance usually depends on the extent to which Members want to debate and amend the legislation. In general, all of the procedures of the House permit a majority of Members to work their will without excessive delay. The House considers most legislation by motions to suspend the rules, with limited debate and no floor amendments, with the support of at least two-thirds of the Members voting. Occasionally, the House will choose to consider a measure on the floor by the unanimous consent of Members. The Rules Committee is instrumental in recommending procedures for considering major bills and may propose restrictions on the floor amendments that Members can offer or bar them altogether. Many major bills are first considered in Committee of the Whole before being passed by a simple majority vote of the House. The Committee of the Whole is governed by more flexible procedures than the basic rules of the House, under which a majority can vote to pass a bill after only one hour of debate and with no floor amendments. Although a quorum is supposed to be present on the floor when the House is conducting business, the House assumes a quorum is present unless a quorum call or electronically recorded vote demonstrates that it is not. However, the standing rules preclude quorum calls at most times other than when the House is voting. Questions are first decided by voice vote, although any Member may then demand a division vote. Before the final result of a voice or division vote is announced, Members can secure an electronically recorded vote instead if enough Members desire it or if a quorum is not present in the House. The constitutional requirements for making law mean that each chamber must pass the same measure with the identical text before transmitting it to the President for his consideration. When the second chamber of Congress amends a measure sent to it by the first chamber, the two chambers must resolve legislative differences to meet this requirement. This can be accomplished by shuttling the bill back and forth between the House and Senate, with each chamber proposing amendments to the position of the other, or by establishing a conference committee to try to negotiate a compromise version of the legislation."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6694}
{"pred": " (One page)\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report about the FLSA overtime exemptions for EAP employees. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report is about frequently asked questions regarding the overtime provisions in the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) for executive, administrative, and professional employees (EAP exemptions). It mentions previous reports from CRS, like R45007 and R42713, which I should probably reference in the summary. The report is divided into three sections: overview of the FLSA and EAP exemptions, applicability of the exemptions, and the 2019 proposed rule and 2016 final rule.\n\nFirst, the FLSA was enacted in 1938 and sets minimum wage and overtime pay requirements for most, but not all, private and public sector employees. Section 7(a) says that unless an employee is specifically exempted, they are nonexempt and must be paid time and a half. The EAP exemption was added to the FLSA, allowing certain employees to be exempt from overtime. The Secretary of Labor can define these terms through regulations. The rationale was that EAP work is harder to standardize and they have other forms of compensation.\n\nThe three criteria for exemption: salary basis, duties, salary level. For executive, administrative, and professional employees, specific duties tests. For executive, they must manage the enterprise or department, direct two or more employees, have authority to hire/fire or recommendations carry weight. For administrative, duties directly related to management or business operations, exercise discretion and independent judgment. For professional, work requiring advanced knowledge or originality in art or science.\n\nAlso, the salary level has been raised multiple times since 1938. The 2016 final rule was invalidated, so current regulations are based on 2004 rules. The 2019 proposed rule would increase the salary level, but the 2016 rule is still not in effect. \n\nThe report also discusses coverage for nonprofits, institutions of higher education, state and local governments, and U.S. territories. It mentions that there's no blanket exemption for nonprofits, and that coverage depends on enterprise and individual tests. For IHEs, many are exempt due to other provisions, but some like postdocs and non-academic staff may be affected. State and local governments are covered, but some employees are not", "answers": ["The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), enacted in 1938, is the main federal law that establishes general wage and hour standards for most, but not all, private and public sector employees. Among other protections, the FLSA establishes that covered nonexempt employees must be compensated at one-and-a-half times their regular rate of pay for each hour worked over 40 hours in a workweek. The FLSA also establishes certain exemptions from its general labor market standards. One of the major exemptions to the overtime provisions in the FLSA is for bona fide \"executive, administrative, and professional\" employees (the \"EAP\" or \"white collar\" exemptions). The FLSA grants authority to the Secretary of Labor to define and delimit the EAP exemption \"from time to time.\" To qualify for this exemption from the FLSA's overtime pay requirement, an employee must be salaried (the \"salary basis\" test); perform specified executive, administrative, or professional duties (the \"duties\" test); and earn above an established salary level threshold (the \"salary level\" test). In March 2019, the Secretary of Labor published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to make changes to the EAP exemptions. The 2019 proposed rule would become effective around January 2020. The major changes in the 2019 proposed rule include increasing the standard salary level threshold from the previous level of $455 per week to $679 per week and committing the Department of Labor (DOL) to updating the EAP exemptions every four years through the rulemaking process. The 2019 proposed rule does not change the duties and responsibilities that employees must perform to be exempt. Thus, the 2019 proposed rule would affect EAP employees at salary levels between $455 and $679 per week in 2020. DOL estimates that about 4.9 million workers would be affected in the first year, including about 1.3 million EAP employees who would become newly entitled to overtime pay and an additional 3.6 million workers who would have overtime protection clarified and thereby strengthened.

According to a joint strategic plan with USAID for fiscal years 2018-2022, State's goals include protecting national security, promoting economic growth, and ensuring effective operations. State employs Foreign Service officers in two categories: generalists and specialists. Generalists are assigned to one of five career tracks, including political, economic, and public diplomacy, and they collect information and engage with foreign governments and citizens, reporting back to State. Specialists support the functioning of overseas posts in 25 different skill groups, such as security officers or information management. State may direct employees to any post or headquarters, but generally uses other methods to fill high-priority positions. The process for assigning officers involves bidding on vacancies, with incentives for difficult posts. State groups countries into six geographic regions, with overseas posts reporting to their respective regional bureaus. As of March 31, 2018, 13% of State's overseas Foreign Service positions were vacant, a rate similar to that reported in 2012 and 2008. The number of staffed positions increased by over 20% from 2008 to 2018, but vacancies remained high. Specialist positions, such as security officers and information management, are particularly affected, with 14.2% of specialist positions vacant. Vacancies in critical roles like political and economic officers affect diplomatic readiness and the ability to engage with host governments on critical issues. The highest vacancy rates were in the South and Central Asian Affairs Bureau (SCA) and Near Eastern Affairs Bureau (NEA), which are regions with heightened security risks. Vacancies increase workloads and stress, leading to burnout and early termination of assignments, exacerbating vacancies. State's efforts to address vacancies are not guided by an integrated action plan to reduce persistent vacancies. The report recommends that the Secretary of State develop an integrated action plan to define the root causes of the vacancies and provide suggested corrective measures to reduce such vacancies, including steps necessary to implement solutions.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this government report.

In 2009 and 2012, GAO identified ongoing Foreign Service staffing gaps. GAO was asked to review State's Foreign Service staffing. This report examines (1) vacancies in State's Foreign Service staffing at overseas posts, (2) reported effects of Foreign Service vacancies on diplomatic readiness, and (3) State's efforts to address Foreign Service vacancies. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed State's Global Employment Management System data as of March 2018. The system includes information on Foreign Service and Civil Service positions, including the total number of authorized Foreign Service positions and whether each position is filled or vacant. GAO also reviewed its relevant prior reports and State workforce planning documents. In addition, GAO interviewed State staff at 10 overseas posts, selected on the basis of large numbers of Foreign Service vacancies and diversity in the types of Foreign Service positions that were vacant at these posts, among other factors. The Department of State's (State) data show persistent Foreign Service vacancies at overseas posts since 2008. According to the data, 13 percent of overseas Foreign Service positions were vacant as of March 2018. This percentage is similar to the percentages GAO reported for 2008 and 2012, when 14 percent of these positions were vacant. In addition, State's data show persistent vacancies at overseas posts in generalist positions that help formulate and implement U.S. foreign policy and in specialist positions that support and maintain the functioning of overseas posts. State's data also show persistent Foreign Service vacancies at overseas posts with State's highest foreign policy priorities and in regions with security risks that could threaten U.S. foreign policy interests. According to staff at overseas posts, Foreign Service vacancies adversely affect State's ability to carry out U.S. foreign policy. Staff at overseas posts told us that vacancies increase workloads, contributing to low morale and higher stress for Foreign Service staff and that vacancies in Political and Economic positions—20 percent and 16 percent, respectively—limit the reporting on political and economic issues that posts are able to provide to State headquarters. Notably, officials also stated that vacancies in specialist positions may heighten security risks at overseas posts and disrupt post operations. For instance, some overseas post staff said that vacancies in Information Management positions had increased the vulnerability of posts' computer networks to potential cybersecurity attacks and other malicious threats. State described various efforts—implemented by multiple offices in the department —to help address overseas Foreign Service vacancies, but these efforts are not guided by an integrated action plan to reduce persistent vacancies. An example of State's efforts is the “Hard-to-Fill” program, which allows Civil Service staff an opportunity to fill a Foreign Service vacancy on a single overseas tour. According to GAO's 2017 High-Risk Series report, an agency should design and implement an action plan—integrated across its relevant offices—that defines the root causes of all skills gaps and suggests corrective measures. However, State has not developed such an action plan for reducing persistent overseas Foreign Service vacancies. Without developing an integrated action plan, overseas Foreign Service vacancies may persist. As a result, State's ability to achieve U.S. foreign policy goals and help ensure secure and efficient operations could be adversely impacted.

Key points include the significant increase in domestic crude oil production, driven by technological advancements in shale formations, leading to a decline in net imports. Projections indicate the U.S. will become a net exporter by the late 2020s, eliminating the 90-day reserve obligation. The SPR, managed by the Department of Energy (DOE), stores crude oil in underground salt caverns along the Gulf Coast. While the SPR meets the 90-day reserve requirement through a combination of public and private reserves, the U.S. is projected to become a net exporter by the late 2020s, which would eliminate the 90-day reserve obligation. However, the SPR would still need to respond to supply disruptions. The SPR is currently at 695 million barrels, with a design capacity of 713.5 million barrels. However, the infrastructure is aging, leading to increased maintenance costs and decreased system reliability. The SPR has experienced several major equipment failures since 2013, including the Big Hill site pipe failure. The SPR has been used in response to domestic supply disturbances, such as hurricanes. The report also highlights the SPR's role in the International Energy Program (IEA) and its obligation to release reserves in the event of a supply disruption. The SPR is used to meet the U.S. obligation to release reserves in the event of a supply disruption. The SPR is primarily composed of crude oil, which may not be effective in responding to disruptions that affect the refining sector.

The SPR is used to meet the U.S. obligation to hold the equivalent of 90 days of net imports. The SPR is also used to meet the IEA's 90-day reserve obligation. The report concludes with recommendations for the Secretary of Energy to supplement the 2016 SPR review with additional analysis, and to conduct periodic reviews", "answers": ["More than 4 decades ago, Congress authorized the creation of the SPR to reduce the impact of disruptions in supplies of petroleum products. DOE manages the SPR. As a member of the International Energy Agency, the United States is obligated to maintain reserves equivalent to at least 90 days of the previous year's net imports (imports minus exports). The SPR's storage and related infrastructure is aging, and DOE has plans to modernize these facilities. Since 2015, Congress has mandated crude oil sales. As of March 2018, the SPR held about 665 million barrels of crude oil. GAO was asked to examine the SPR's ability to meet U.S. energy security needs. This report examines, among other things, the extent to which (1) DOE has identified the optimal size of the SPR, and (2) DOE's plans for modernizing the SPR take into account the effects of congressionally mandated crude oil sales. GAO reviewed DOE's plans and studies, and interviewed agency officials and nine experts selected based on prior work, referrals, and a literature review. The Department of Energy (DOE) has not identified the optimal size of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). In 2016, DOE completed a long-term strategic review of the SPR after its last comprehensive examination conducted in 2005. The 2016 review examined the benefits of several SPR sizes, but it did not identify an optimal size and its review was limited in several ways. In particular, DOE did not fully consider recent and expected future changes in market conditions, such as the implications of falling net imports, or the role that increased levels of private reserves (reserves held by private companies for their own purposes) may play in responding to supply disruptions. These changes have contributed to SPR and private reserves reaching historically high levels on a net imports basis (see figure). These changes are expected to continue to evolve—according to government projections, the United States will become a net exporter in the late 2020s before again becoming a net importer between 2040 and 2050. GAO has found that agencies should reexamine their programs if conditions change. Without addressing the limitations of its 2016 review and periodically performing reexaminations in the future, DOE cannot be assured that the SPR will be sized appropriately into the future. DOE has taken steps to take into account congressionally mandated sales of SPR crude oil in its $1.4 billion modernization plans for SPR's infrastructure and facilities. The SPR is projected to hold 405 million barrels of oil by the end of fiscal year 2027. However, DOE's current plans are based on information analyzed prior to recently mandated sales. According to DOE officials, the agency began a study in March 2018 to assess the effects of these sales on the SPR's modernization. However, this study is not examining all options for handling any excess SPR assets that may be created by currently mandated sales or any additional sales that may be mandated in the future, inconsistent with an agency order on real property asset management that calls for identifying excess assets. For example, DOE does not plan to examine the potential to lease unused SPR storage capacity to the private sector because DOE is not currently authorized to enter into such leases, according to agency officials. If authorized, leasing capacity could generate revenues that could help offset the costs of modernization. By not examining a full range of options, DOE risks missing beneficial ways to modernize the SPR while saving taxpayer resources. GAO is making four recommendations, including that DOE (1) supplement the 2016 review by conducting an additional analysis, (2) ensure that the agency periodically reexamines the size of the SPR, and (3) consider a full range of options for handling potentially excess assets as it conducts its study, among other things. DOE agreed with two, partially agreed with one, and disagreed with another recommendation on refined product reserve studies. GAO maintains that the recommendations are valid."], "all_classes": null, "length": 7913}

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report is about the VA's transition from the legacy MSPV program to the new MSPV-NG program. The main issue is that the old program didn't allow for standardization of medical supplies, which made it hard for the VA to get cost savings by buying in bulk. The VA wanted to standardize supplies to improve buying power, simplify supply chain management, and ensure clinical consistency. They started the transition in 2016, but there were problems with the implementation. \n\nThe MSPV-NG program was supposed to have a narrow formulary, with standardization of items, and the VA's goals included cost avoidance, improved efficiency, and clinician involvement. However, the VA didn't have a clear strategy, leadership was unstable, and there were staffing issues. The initial formulary was based on past purchases, not clinician input, leading to a list of 6,000 items. This caused issues with contracting, as companies found the requirements too specific and not competitive. The VA had to use non-competitive agreements to keep supplies available, but this didn't help with cost savings. \n\nThe VA faced challenges in achieving utilization rates and cost avoidance. They had a target of 40% utilization, but it was only around 24% as of May 2017. The program office had four directors, two acting, and two with other duties. \n\nThe report mentions that the VA's implementation of MSPV-NG had issues like lack of a documented strategy, leadership instability, and workforce capacity. These factors contributed to the program not meeting its goals. \n\nThe VA made some changes in the second phase, like involving clinicians more. However, the program still has challenges, such as the lack of a clear strategy, leadership issues, and staffing problems. \n\nThe VA's transition to MSPV-NG was a major effort involving multiple stakeholders. However, the initial requirements development and tight time frames led to ineffective contracting processes. \n\nThe VA's initial formulary didn't meet the needs of the medical centers, and the utilization and cost avoidance goals haven't been achieved yet. \n\nThe VA's goals for MSPV-NG include standardization, cost avoidance, efficiency in ordering and supply chain management, and clinician involvement. \n\n", "answers": ["VA spends hundreds of millions of dollars annually on medical supplies to meet the health care needs of about 7 million veterans. To provide a more efficient, cost-effective way for its medical centers to order supplies, the VA established the MSPV-NG program. The program's goals include involving clinicians in requirements development, leveraging buying power when making competitive awards, and consolidating supplies used across medical centers. VA began developing requirements in early 2015 and launched the program in December 2016. This testimony summarizes key information contained in GAO's November 2017 report, GAO-18-34 . Specifically, it addresses the extent to which VA's implementation of MSPV-NG has been effective in meeting program goals. GAO analyzed VA's requirements development and contracting processes, and identified key supply chain practices cited by four leading hospital networks. GAO also met with contracting and clinical officials at six medical centers, selected based on high dollar contract obligations in fiscal years 2014-2016 and geographic representation. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) established the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor-Next Generation (MSPV-NG) program to provide an efficient, cost-effective way for its facilities to order supplies, but its initial implementation did not have an overarching strategy, stable leadership, and workforce capacity that could have facilitated medical center buy-in for the change. VA also developed requirements for a broad range of MSPV-NG items with limited clinical input. Further, starting in June 2015, VA planned to award competitive contracts, but instead, 79 percent of the items available for purchase under MSPV-NG were added through non-competitive agreements. (See figure). As a result, the program did not meet the needs of medical centers, and usage remained below VA's 40 percent target. (See figure.) VA has taken steps to address some deficiencies and is developing a new approach to the program. However, VA will likely continue to face challenges in meeting its goals until it fully addresses these existing shortcomings. GAO made 10 recommendations in its November 2017 report, including that VA develop an overarching strategy, expand clinician input in requirements development, and establish a plan for awarding future competitive contracts.

{"pred": " The report outlines the process and traditions behind naming U.S. Navy ships. Historically, the Secretary of the Navy was responsible for selecting ship names, a role that has evolved over time. While there is no explicit law dictating the naming process, the Secretary retains implicit authority, guided by historical practices and traditions. The process involves compiling name recommendations from the Naval History and Heritage Command, which considers a variety of sources, including historical data, public suggestions, and recommendations from service members and officials. These recommendations are then reviewed by the Chief of Naval Operations and sent to the Secretary of the Navy for final selection. The Secretary considers all suggestions, including those from the public, and selects names for specific ships, usually before the christening. The ship's sponsor, often a descendant of the named individual, is also chosen by the Secretary. The report also discusses the evolution of naming conventions, noting that while certain types of ships have traditional naming rules, exceptions are made for individuals or events. For example, the Virginia-class submarines have been named for states, but exceptions have been made for people like John Warner. The report highlights that while the naming process is not strictly regulated, it is deeply rooted in the Navy's history and values. It also touches on the naming of ships for living people, which is a rare but recognized practice. The report also mentions the naming of ships for Confederate officers, which has sparked debate over historical memory and national identity. Additionally, the report notes that the Navy sometimes announces ship names before they are procured, which can lead to potential issues with congressional approval and the actual procurement of the ship. The report was submitted in response to a provision in the FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act, which expressed the Congress's sense about the naming of future ships. The report concludes that the current naming practices are consistent with historical traditions and that establishing fixed policies would be inadvisable.\n\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report about how the U.S. Navy names its ships. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report starts by explaining that traditionally, the Secretary of the Navy has been responsible for naming new ships. This was explicitly stated in U.S. law until 1925, when the reference to the Secretary's role was removed from the U.S. Code. Now, the current law (10 U.S.C. §8662) doesn't specify who names ships, but the Secretary is believed to have", "answers": ["Names for Navy ships traditionally have been chosen and announced by the Secretary of the Navy, under the direction of the President and in accordance with rules prescribed by Congress. Rules for giving certain types of names to certain types of Navy ships have evolved over time. There have been exceptions to the Navy's ship-naming rules, particularly for the purpose of naming a ship for a person when the rule for that type of ship would have called for it to be named for something else. Some observers have perceived a breakdown in, or corruption of, the rules for naming Navy ships. On July 13, 2012, the Navy submitted to Congress a 73-page report on the Navy's policies and practices for naming ships. For ship types now being procured for the Navy, or recently procured for the Navy, naming rules can be summarized as follows: The first Ohio replacement ballistic missile submarine (SSBN-826) has been named Columbia in honor of the District of Columbia, but the Navy has not stated what the naming rule for these ships will be. Virginia (SSN-774) class attack submarines are being named for states. Aircraft carriers are generally named for past U.S. Presidents. Of the past 14, 10 were named for past U.S. Presidents, and 2 for Members of Congress. Destroyers are being named for deceased members of the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, including Secretaries of the Navy. The Navy has not yet announced a naming rule for its planned new class of FFG(X) frigates, the first of which the Navy wants to procure in FY2021. Previous classes of U.S. Navy frigates, like Navy destroyers, were generally named for naval leaders and heroes. Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) are being named for regionally important U.S. cities and communities. Amphibious assault ships are being named for important battles in which U.S. Marines played a prominent part, and for famous earlier U.S. Navy ships that were not named for battles. San Antonio (LPD-17) class amphibious ships are being named for major U.S. cities and communities, and cities and communities attacked on September 11, 2001. John Lewis (TAO-205) class oilers are being named for people who fought for civil rights and human rights. Expeditionary Fast Transports (EPFs) are being named for small U.S. cities. Expeditionary Transport Docks (ESDs) and Expeditionary Sea Bases (ESBs) are being named for famous names or places of historical significance to U.S. Marines. Navajo (TATS-6) class towing, salvage, and rescue ships are being named for prominent Native Americans or Native American tribes. Since 1974, at least 21 U.S. military ships have been named for persons who were living at the time the name was announced. The most recent instance occurred on May 6, 2019, when the Navy announced that it was naming the destroyer DDG-51 for former Senator Sam Nunn. Members of the public are sometimes interested in having Navy ships named for their own states or cities, for older U.S. Navy ships (particularly those on which they or their relatives served), for battles in which they or their relatives participated, or for people they admire. Congress has long maintained an interest in how Navy ships are named, and has influenced the naming of certain Navy ships. The Navy suggests that congressional offices wishing to express support for proposals to name a Navy ship for a specific person, place, or thing contact the office of the Secretary of the Navy to make their support known. Congress may also pass legislation relating to ship names. Measures passed by Congress in recent years regarding Navy ship names have all been sense-of-the-Congress provisions."], "all_classes": null, "length": 9736}
{"pred": " The U.S. Fourth National Climate Assessment (2018) highlights that climate change is already affecting the United States and will worsen without significant action to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. While various efforts to cut emissions are underway internationally and sub-nationally, there is ongoing debate among federal policymakers and stakeholders about the appropriate response to climate change. Some view it as an existential threat requiring immediate and substantial emission reductions, citing authoritative reports like the IPCC's \"Global Warming of 1.5°C\" and the U.S. Global Change Research Program's assessment. Others question the risks and argue that unilateral U.S. action could harm domestic industries with minimal global impact.\n\nThe report explores the potential of a carbon tax or emissions fee as a policy tool to reduce GHG emissions. A carbon tax could be applied to emissions or to the materials that generate them, such as fossil fuels. This would increase the relative cost of carbon-intensive energy sources like coal, encouraging innovation in cleaner technologies and energy efficiency. However, the tax could also lead to higher prices for energy and goods, with negative effects on certain industries and demographic groups.\n\nKey considerations include the point of taxation, tax rate, and border adjustments. The point of taxation determines which entities are responsible for paying the tax, monitoring emissions, and maintaining records. A broader scope of emissions could increase administrative costs. Tax rates could be set to meet specific emission targets, such as the 2015 Paris Agreement goals, or based on the social cost of carbon. However, these estimates are subject to methodological and value judgments, and the choice of discount rate can significantly affect the value of the social cost of carbon.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n", "answers": ["The U.S. Fourth National Climate Assessment, released in 2018, concluded that \"the impacts of global climate change are already being felt in the United States and are projected to intensify in the future—but the severity of future impacts will depend largely on actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas [GHG] emissions and to adapt to the changes that will occur.\" Members of Congress and stakeholders articulate a wide range of perspectives over what to do, if anything, about GHG emissions, future climate change, and related impacts. If Congress were to consider establishing a program to reduce GHG emissions, one option would be to attach a price to GHG emissions with a carbon tax or GHG emissions fee. In the 115th Congress, Members introduced nine bills to establish a carbon tax or emissions fee program. However, many Members have expressed their opposition to such an approach. In particular, in the 115th Congress, the House passed a resolution \"expressing the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the United States economy.\" Multiple economic studies have estimated the emission reductions that particular carbon tax would achieve. For example, a 2018 study analyzed various impacts of four carbon tax rate scenarios: a $25/metric ton of CO2 and $50/metric ton of CO2 carbon tax, increasing annually by 1% and 5%. The study concluded that each of the scenarios would likely achieve the U.S. GHG emission reduction target pledged under the international Paris Agreement (at least in terms of CO2 emissions). A carbon tax system would generate a new revenue stream, the magnitude of which would depend on the scope and rate of the tax, among other factors. In 2018, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that a $25/metric ton carbon tax would yield approximately $100 billion in its first year. CBO projected that federal revenue would total $3.5 trillion in FY2019. Policymakers would face challenging decisions regarding the distribution of the new carbon tax revenues. Congress could apply revenues to support a range of policy objectives but would encounter trade-offs among the objectives. The central trade-offs involve minimizing economy-wide costs, lessening the costs borne by specific groups—particularly low-income households and displaced workers in certain industries (e.g., coal mining)—and supporting other policy objectives. A primary argument against a carbon tax regards it potential economy-wide impacts, often measured as impacts to the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). Some may argue that projected impacts should be compared with the climate benefits achieved from the program as well as the estimated costs of taking no action. The potential impacts would depend on a number of factors, including the program's magnitude and design and, most importantly, the use of carbon tax revenues. In general, economic literature finds that some of the revenue applications would reduce the economy-wide costs from a carbon tax but may not eliminate them entirely. In addition, some studies cite particular economic modeling scenarios in which certain carbon tax revenue applications produce a net increase in GDP compared to a baseline scenario. These scenarios involve using carbon tax revenues to offset reductions in other tax rates (e.g., corporate income or payroll taxes). Although economic models generally indicate that these particular revenue applications would yield the greatest benefit to the economy overall, the models also find that lower-income households would likely face a disproportionate impact under such an approach. As lower-income households spend a greater proportion of their income on energy needs (electricity, gasoline), these households are expected to experience disproportionate impacts from a carbon tax if revenues were not recycled back to them in some fashion (e.g., lump-sum distribution). A price on GHG emissions could create a competitive disadvantage for some industries, particularly \"emission-intensive, trade-exposed industries.\" Policymakers have several options to address this concern, including establishing a \"border carbon adjustment\" program, which would levy a fee on imports from countries without comparable GHG reduction programs. Alternatively, policymakers could allocate (indefinitely or for a period of time) some of the carbon tax revenues to selected industry sectors or businesses. Relatedly, a carbon tax system is projected to disproportionately impact fossil fuel industries, particularly coal, and the communities that rely on their employment. To alleviate these impacts, policymakers may consider using some of the revenue to provide transition assistance to employees or affected communities."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8507}

To do so, USPS is required to make payments into the RHB Fund, which is administered by OPM. However, USPS has not made any payments to the fund since fiscal year 2010. At the end of fiscal year 2017, USPS had missed $38.2 billion in payments, leaving the fund 44 percent funded. Pursuant to law, beginning in fiscal year 2017, OPM started drawing from the fund to cover USPS's share of postal retirees' health benefits premiums. GAO was asked to review issues related to the sustainability of the RHB Fund. This report examines (1) the financial outlook for the RHB Fund and (2) policy approaches for postal retiree health benefits, among other topics. GAO evaluated financial projections for the RHB Fund from OPM. GAO reviewed laws and regulations and identified policy approaches primarily by identifying legislative proposals, and literature on actions of companies and state governments to address retiree health benefits. These approaches are not exhaustive or mutually exclusive. GAO also interviewed experts in retiree health benefits and postal stakeholders, chosen on the basis of relevant publications and prior GAO work, and interviewed and obtained written responses from OPM and USPS officials. The financial outlook of the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund (RHB Fund) is poor. At the end of fiscal year 2017, the fund's assets declined to $49.8 billion and unfunded liabilities rose to $62.2 billion. Based on Office of Personnel Management (OPM) projections requested by GAO, the fund is on track to be depleted in fiscal year 2030 if the United States Postal Service (USPS) continues to make no payments into the fund. Annual payments of $1 billion or $2 billion into the fund would extend the projected depletion date by 2 to 5 years (see figure). USPS has said that its required payments to the fund are unaffordable relative to its current financial situation and outlook. For the past 11 years USPS has incurred large operating losses that it expects will continue. Additionally, USPS has stated that its opportunities for revenue generation and cost-cutting are limited. USPS reported that it did not make required fund payments in 2017 in order to preserve liquidity and cover operational costs. If the fund becomes depleted, USPS would be required by law to make the payments necessary to cover its share of health benefits premiums for current postal retirees. Current law does not address what would happen if the fund becomes depleted and USPS does not make payments to cover those premiums. Depletion of the fund could affect postal retirees as well as USPS, customers, and other stakeholders, including the federal government. About 500,000 postal retirees receive health benefits and OPM expects that number to remain about the same through 2035. GAO identified three categories of policy approaches for postal retiree health benefits, based on legislative proposals and pertinent literature. First, some approaches, such as generally requiring eligible postal retirees to participate in Medicare, would shift costs to the federal government. Second, some approaches would reduce benefits or increase costs to postal retirees and/or employees. Third, some approaches would change how benefits are financed (see table). All of these approaches have different potential effects and would require congressional action. Thus, it is up to Congress to consider the merits of different approaches and determine the most appropriate action to take. It would be preferable to take action when careful consideration is possible, rather than wait until lack of adequate funding could disrupt postal retiree health benefits. Congress should consider passing legislation to put postal retiree health benefits on a more sustainable financial footing.

NAS is caused by prenatal opioid exposure, which can occur through prescription medications, medication-assisted treatment, prescription drug misuse, or illicit opioid use. The report highlights that NAS is a growing public health concern, with over 80% of NAS cases being paid for by Medicaid. The report outlines the treatment approaches for NAS, including non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic methods. Non-pharmacologic treatment, such as rooming-in, swaddling, and breastfeeding, is recommended as the first line of treatment. These methods can help reduce the severity of NAS symptoms and the length of hospital stays. Pharmacologic treatment, such as methadone or morphine, is used for moderate to severe symptoms. The report also discusses the challenges in treating NAS, such as maternal polysubstance use, stigma, limited hospital capacity, and lack of research. The report also highlights the federal government's efforts to address NAS, including the Protecting Our Infants Act: Final Strategy, which outlines 39 recommendations for preventing and treating NAS. However, the report notes that the HHS lacks a comprehensive plan for implementing these recommendations, which raises concerns about the timely implementation and effectiveness of these measures. The report concludes that the Secretary of HHS should expedite the development of a plan that includes priorities, timelines, clear roles and responsibilities, and methods for assessing progress to effectively address NAS.\n\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this lengthy report. Let me start by reading through the report again to get the main points. The report is about neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), which occurs when infants are exposed to opioids in the womb. The causes include prescription medications, medication-assisted treatment, prescription drug misuse, and illicit opioid use. The report mentions that a significant percentage of pregnant Medicaid beneficiaries used opioids during pregnancy, with a 2014 study showing 22% of them. \n\nThe treatment approaches are divided into non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic. Non-pharmacologic includes rooming-in, swaddling, breastfeeding. These methods are recommended first. If symptoms are severe, pharmacologic treatment is used. The report also talks about the challenges, like maternal polysubstance use, stigma, limited hospital capacity, and lack of research. There's a mention of the Protecting Our Infants Act, which includes 39 recommendations. However, the HHS hasn't developed a detailed implementation plan,", "answers": ["As the opioid crisis has increased in recent years, so has the number of pregnant women who use opioids, which can result in NAS. A recent peer-reviewed study found that cases of NAS have grown nearly five-fold between 2000 and 2012 and that most infants with NAS are covered under Medicaid. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 includes a provision for GAO to examine NAS in the United States and related treatment services covered under Medicaid. This report 1) describes the hospital and non-hospital settings for treating infants with NAS and how Medicaid pays for services, 2) describes recommended practices and challenges for addressing NAS, and 3) examines HHS's strategy for addressing NAS. GAO reviewed HHS documentation and interviewed HHS officials. GAO also conducted site visits to four states—Kentucky, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin—selected based on several factors, including incidence rates of NAS and geographic variation. GAO interviewed stakeholders from 32 organizations, including health care providers and state officials in the selected states. The prenatal use of opioids or other drugs can produce a withdrawal condition in newborns known as neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Health care providers, state officials, and other stakeholders told GAO that most infants with NAS are treated in the hospital—such as in a neonatal intensive care unit—though some may be referred to a non-hospital setting—such as a neonatal withdrawal center with nursery rooms—to complete their treatment. The table below provides more information on settings for treating infants with NAS and on how Medicaid pays for services in these settings. According to stakeholders GAO interviewed and literature reviewed, there are several recommended practices and challenges associated with addressing NAS. The most frequently recommended practices included prioritizing non-pharmacologic treatment to infants—treatment that does not involve medications—such as allowing the mother to reside with the infant during treatment; educating mothers and health care providers on treatment of NAS, among other things; and using a protocol in the hospital or non-hospital setting for screening and treating infants with NAS. The most frequently cited challenges included the maternal use of multiple drugs—or polysubstance use—as it can exacerbate NAS symptoms; stigma faced by pregnant women who use opioids; hospital staff burden and limited physical capacity to care for infants with NAS; limited coordination of care for mothers and infants with NAS; and gaps in research and data on NAS, such as research on the long-term effects of the condition. In May 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a strategy document that makes key recommendations to address NAS. The Strategy recommends, for example, that health care providers receive continuing education on managing and treating infants with NAS and promote non-pharmacologic treatment. According to HHS officials, these recommendations will inform planning and policy across the department. However, HHS has yet to determine how and when the recommendations will be implemented, including establishing priorities; the roles and responsibilities of other federal, state, and public stakeholders; implementation timeframes; and methods for assessing progress. HHS officials told GAO that they expect to develop an implementation plan sometime in 2017 but had no timeline for doing so. Without a plan that clearly specifies how HHS will implement the Strategy and assess its progress, the department increases the risk that its recommendations for addressing NAS will not be implemented. HHS should expeditiously develop a plan for implementing the recommendations included in its strategy related to addressing NAS. HHS concurred that it should expeditiously address NAS, but noted implementation of the strategy is contingent on funding."], "all_classes": null, "length": 9838}
{"pred": " The report provides an overview of the current state of Internet privacy in the United States, highlighting the lack of a comprehensive federal privacy law. It explains that while companies collect and use consumer data for various purposes, including advertising and service provision, they are often required to disclose this through privacy policies. However, the current federal framework is composed of sector-specific laws, such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. These laws protect personal information in specific contexts, but they do not fully address the complexities of modern technology and market changes. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the primary federal agency overseeing Internet privacy, using its authority under section 5 of the FTC Act to combat unfair and deceptive practices. The FTC has taken numerous enforcement actions against companies that violated privacy policies, often leading to settlements where companies had to change their practices. The report also discusses the challenges in enforcing Internet privacy regulations, including the lack of clear standards and the potential for legal loopholes. It notes that while the FTC has the flexibility to address changing market conditions. The report highlights the concerns of consumers regarding their data privacy, including identity theft, credit card fraud, and loss of control over personal information. It also mentions the public's lack of understanding of how their data are collected and used. The report concludes that there is a need for comprehensive federal privacy legislation to address the evolving landscape of Internet privacy and to enhance consumer protections.\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of this report. Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe report is quite lengthy, but the main points are: there's no comprehensive federal privacy law in the US, companies collect and use data for various purposes, including advertising, and they often have privacy policies that consumers may need to consent to use the service. The current federal framework includes laws that apply to specific sectors or situations, such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. These laws protect personal information in certain contexts, but they do not fully address the changes in technology and marketplace. The FTC is the main federal agency responsible for Internet privacy, using its authority under section 5 of the FTC Act to address unfair and deceptive practices.

This disclosure followed other recent incidents involving the misuse of consumers' personal information from the Internet, which is used by about three-quarters of Americans. GAO was asked to review federal oversight of Internet privacy. This report addresses, among other objectives: (1) how FTC and FCC have overseen consumers' Internet privacy and (2) selected stakeholders' views on the strengths and limitations of how Internet privacy currently is overseen and how, if it all, this approach could be enhanced. GAO evaluated FTC and FCC Internet privacy enforcement actions and authorities and interviewed representatives from industry, consumer advocacy groups, and academia; FTC and FCC staff; former FTC and FCC commissioners; and officials from other federal oversight agencies. Industry stakeholders were selected to represent different sectors, and academics were selected because of their expertise in privacy, consumer protection, and regulatory issues. The United States does not have a comprehensive Internet privacy law governing the collection, use, and sale or other disclosure of consumers' personal information. At the federal level, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) currently has the lead in overseeing Internet privacy, using its statutory authority under the FTC Act to protect consumers from unfair and deceptive trade practices. However, to date FTC has not issued regulations for Internet privacy other than those protecting financial privacy and the Internet privacy of children, which were required by law. For FTC Act violations, FTC may promulgate regulations but is required to use procedures that differ from traditional notice-and-comment processes and that FTC staff said add time and complexity. In the last decade, FTC has filed 101 enforcement actions regarding Internet privacy; nearly all actions resulted in settlement agreements requiring action by the companies. In most of these cases, FTC did not levy civil penalties because it lacked such authority for those particular violations. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has had a limited role in overseeing Internet privacy. From 2015 to 2017, FCC asserted jurisdiction over the privacy practices of Internet service providers. In 2016, FCC promulgated privacy rules for Internet service providers that Congress later repealed. FTC resumed privacy oversight of Internet service providers in June 2018. Stakeholders GAO interviewed had varied views on the current Internet privacy enforcement approach and how it could be enhanced. Most Internet industry stakeholders said they favored FTC's current approach—direct enforcement of its unfair and deceptive practices statutory authority, rather than promulgating and enforcing regulations implementing that authority. These stakeholders said that the current approach allows for flexibility and that regulations could hinder innovation. Other stakeholders, including consumer advocates and most former FTC and FCC commissioners GAO interviewed, favored having FTC issue and enforce regulations. Some stakeholders said a new data-protection agency was needed to oversee consumer privacy. Stakeholders identified three main areas in which Internet privacy oversight could be enhanced: Statute . Some stakeholders told GAO that an overarching Internet privacy statute could enhance consumer protection by clearly articulating to consumers, industry, and agencies what behaviors are prohibited. Rulemaking . Some stakeholders said that regulations can provide clarity, enforcement fairness, and flexibility. Officials from two other consumer protection agencies said their rulemaking authority assists in their oversight efforts and works together with enforcement actions. Civil penalty authority. Some stakeholders said FTC's Internet privacy enforcement could be more effective with authority to levy civil penalties for first-time violations of the FTC Act. Comprehensive Internet privacy legislation that establishes specific standards and includes traditional notice-and-comment rulemaking and broader civil penalty authority could enhance the federal government's ability to protect consumer privacy. Congress should consider developing comprehensive legislation on Internet privacy that would enhance consumer protections and provide flexibility to address a rapidly evolving Internet environment.

Let me start by reading through the report again to understand the main points. \n\nThe report is from the FBI and GSA about the Hoover Building and their headquarters facilities. The key issues are security, space, and building condition. The FBI has outgrown the Hoover Building since 9/11, leading to annexes in various locations. The security concerns are mentioned, especially with annexes in multitenant buildings. Also, the FBI leases space from foreign owners, which could pose security risks. \n\nIn terms of space, the Hoover Building has a lot of unusable space, and the remaining space isn't designed for current FBI needs. The building's original design is inefficient, making it hard to reconfigure for collaboration. The GSA has been assessing the needs and the building's condition. \n\nThe building's condition is deteriorating, and GSA has limited investments to maintain safety and functionality. The FBI is still in the building, so they need to address these issues. \n\nIn 2011, the report found that the Hoover Building didn't meet the FBI's long-term needs. Since then, there hasn't been a major change. The FBI's security officials have concerns about the building and annexes. The dispersion of staff in annexes creates security challenges. \n\nIn 2017, the FBI was found to occupy space leased from foreign owners in six locations. Officials said that leasing space in foreign-owned buildings could present security risks like espionage and unauthorized access. \n\nRegarding space, the FBI's current facilities are inadequate. The Hoover Building's design is outdated, making it hard to reconfigure for modern operations. The FBI has faced operational and logistical challenges. \n\nThe building's condition is poor, with significant recapitalization needs. GSA's strategy was to limit investments to protect health and safety. But this could lead to system failures and operational disruptions. \n\nIn 2014, the report mentioned that swap exchanges could be a useful tool for GSA to address challenges in disposing of unneeded property and modernizing or replacing federal buildings. However, GSA has limited experience and has canceled several proposed swap exchanges. \n\nThe report also discusses alternative funding mechanisms for real property projects, such as retained fees, land swaps, and enhanced use leases. These mechanisms can help agencies meet their real property needs without full upfront funding. \n\nThe main", "answers": ["GSA, which manages federal real property on behalf of other federal agencies, faces challenges in funding new construction projects due to budget constraints—including obtaining upfront funding—among other reasons. One type of transaction, called a swap exchange, enables GSA to apply the value of federal property to finance construction without relying on appropriated funds. Under such an exchange, GSA transfers the title of the unneeded property to a private investor after receiving the agreed upon construction services at another location. GSA proposed a swap exchange procurement for construction of a new FBI headquarters building in exchange for the Hoover Building and appropriations to compensate for the difference in value between the Hoover Building and the new building. GSA cancelled this procurement in July 2017 due to lack of funding. This statement addresses (1) GSA's and FBI's assessments of the Hoover Building, (2) GSA efforts to implement swap exchanges, and (3) alternative approaches to funding real property projects. It is based on GAO's body of reports on real property from 2011 to 2017, and selected updates from GSA. In November 2011, GAO reported that, according to General Services Administration (GSA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) assessments, the FBI's headquarters building (Hoover Building) and its accompanying facilities in Washington, D.C., did not fully support the FBI's long-term security, space, and building condition requirements. Since GAO's report, the assessments have not materially changed, for example: Security: GAO's prior work noted that the dispersion of staff in annexes creates security challenges, including where some space was leased by the FBI and other space was leased by nonfederal tenants. Earlier this year, GAO reported the FBI is leasing space in D.C. from foreign owners. Space : In 2011, GAO reported that FBI and GSA studies showed that much of the Hoover Building is unusable. GSA noted in its fiscal year 2017 project prospectus for the FBI headquarters consolidation that the Hoover Building cannot be redeveloped to meet the FBI's current needs. Building Condition: In GAO's 2011 report, GAO noted that the condition of the Hoover Building was deteriorating, and GSA assessments identified significant recapitalization needs. Since GAO's report and in response to GAO's recommendation, GSA has evaluated its approach to maintaining the building and completed some repairs to ensure safety. GSA has limited experience in successfully completing swap exchange transactions and chose not to pursue several proposed swap exchanges, most recently the planned swap exchange for the Hoover Building. GSA has developed criteria for determining when to solicit market interest in a swap exchange, in response to recommendations in GAO's 2014 report. In addition, GSA officials told GAO that they planned to improve the swap exchange process, including the property appraisal process, outreach to stakeholders to identify potential risks associated with future projects, and to the extent possible, mitigate such risks. Nevertheless, several factors may continue to limit use of swap exchanges, including market factors, such as the availability of alternative properties and an investor's approach for valuing properties. For example, in reviewing a proposed swap exchange in Washington, D.C., GAO found in a 2016 report that the proposals from two firms valued the two federal buildings involved in the proposed swap substantially less than GSA's appraised property value. In a 2014 report, GAO identified a number of alternative approaches to funding real property projects. Congress has provided some agencies with specific authorities to use alternative funding mechanisms—including the use of private sector funds or land swaps—for the acquisition, renovation, or disposal of federal real property without full, upfront funding, though GAO has previously reported that upfront funding is the best way to ensure recognition of commitments made in budgeting decisions and maintain fiscal controls. GAO has reported that projects with alternative funding mechanisms present multiple forms of risk that are shared between the agency and any partner or stakeholder. In addition, alternative budgetary structures could be established, such as changing existing or introducing new account structures to fund real property projects. GAO has made recommendations in the past to GSA on various real property issues, including to develop additional guidance for swap exchanges and to evaluate its approach to maintaining the Hoover Building. GSA agreed with these two recommendations and addressed them."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2284}

The report also talks about the funding sources, like FUTA and SUTA taxes. Each state has its own rules, leading to 53 different programs. \n\nEligibility is based on wages and employment in the base period, and states have different methods. Benefits are usually half of average weekly wage up to a maximum. Also, workers must have lost jobs through no fault of their own, be available for work, and actively seeking work. \n\nThe program is funded by FUTA and SUTA. The FUTA tax is 0.6% on first $7,000 of earnings. The sequester order from 2011 affected some UI expenditures, but not UC, UCX, or UCFE. EB and administrative funding are subject to sequester reductions. \n\nThere's a mention of the government shutdown in 2018-2019, which caused furloughs for federal employees.

The lapse in federal appropriations that occurred from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019, created a partial government shutdown. As a result, agencies without funding furloughed many federal employees, and many federal employees excepted from furlough were working without pay during the lapse in appropriations. Furloughed federal employees may be eligible for UCFE benefits. Private-sector workers who are furloughed or laid off due to the partial government shutdown because they were employed by government contractors may be eligible for regular UC benefits. But, according to guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), excepted federal employees who are performing services (without pay) would generally be ineligible for UCFE benefits based on states' definitions of \"unemployment.\" In this climate, there has been congressional interest in assisting furloughed and excepted federal employees through the UI system. UI legislative issues currently facing the 116th Congress include the following: the effects of the FY2019 sequester order on UI programs and benefits, the role of UI in providing temporary income replacement during a government shutdown, state fiscal concerns related to financing UC benefits, reemployment services and eligibility assessments (RESEA), potential consideration of the UI proposals included in the President's FY2020 budget, and congressional oversight related to a proposed UC drug testing rule reissued by DOL after previously being disapproved using the Congressional Review Act.

The BOP, under the oversight of the DOJ's Justice Management Division (JMD), manages human resources, including retention incentives, to address staffing challenges. Retention incentives are authorized under the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 and the Federal Workforce Flexibility Act of 2004, allowing agencies to offer incentives up to 50% of an employee's basic pay for critical needs. BOP funds these incentives primarily from its Salaries and Expenses appropriation, with Central Office allocating funds to regional offices and institutions. Retention incentives are typically awarded to employees with a performance rating of at least \"successful\" or its equivalent, and the incentive is disbursed in installments. The report found that BOP's retention incentive expenditures increased from $10.7 million in fiscal year 2012 to $14.0 million in fiscal year 2016. Additionally, the number of employees who received retention incentives increased each year from 2,024 employees in fiscal year 2012 to 2,460 employees in fiscal year 2016.

BOP has faced challenges retaining staff at correctional facilities, although it has used retention incentives, along with other human capital flexibilities. GAO was asked to review BOP's use of retention incentives. This report addresses: (1) how BOP used its authority to pay retention incentives; (2) internal controls BOP has in place for the use of retention incentives; and (3) the extent to which BOP plans for and evaluates the use of retention incentives. GAO obtained employee-level retention incentive expenditure data from DOJ's Justice Management Division for fiscal years 2012 through 2016. GAO also reviewed agency documentation, such as policy statements and 40 randomly selected retention incentive application packet case files from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. GAO also interviewed officials from BOP's Central Office and four correctional facilities that use retention incentives, selected to reflect variation in the number and types of employees receiving retention incentives, BOP regions, and BOP institution security levels. From fiscal years 2012 to 2016, the Department of Justice's (DOJ) Federal Bureau of Prisons' (BOP) total retention incentive expenditures generally increased from $10.7 to $14.0 million and the number of employees receiving retention incentives increased from 2,024 to 2,460. During those five years, BOP spent more than 97 percent of its total retention incentive expenditures on employees at four BOP institutions in California and for medical professionals nationwide. Further, total retention incentive expenditures for medical professionals increased by an average of 21 percent per year (see figure). According to BOP officials, BOP uses retention incentives, for example, to supplement BOP's medical professionals' salaries which are generally lower than private sector salaries. BOP has a variety of internal controls in place throughout the retention incentive process that help ensure retention incentive applications and approvals meet requirements. For example, each application goes through multiple levels of review to verify its accuracy and completeness. BOP takes steps to determine workforce needs and how to fill those needs, but has not strategically planned for and evaluated its use of retention incentives. According to BOP, planning for human capital needs is conducted at institutions during quarterly meetings, but discussions about these incentives respond to short-term staffing situations rather than proactively addressing future staffing needs. Including human capital goals and strategies in BOP's human capital plan would create a roadmap so the agency could move from being reactive to its current workforce needs to being strategic in trying to achieve its long-term workforce goals. Additionally BOP has not evaluated the effectiveness of its use of retention incentives in retaining staff. As a result, BOP does not know whether retention incentives have contributed to employees' retention in relation to other incentives used by BOP. Consistent with key principles for strategic human capital planning, planning for and evaluating the use of retention incentives could help BOP better determine if these incentives are an efficient and effective means by which to retain staff.

{"pred": " \n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) oversees the process of safety defect vehicle recalls, which are initiated when a vehicle or its equipment poses an unreasonable safety risk. Manufacturers are required to notify vehicle owners via First-Class Mail within 60 days of initiating a recall, and dealers perform the necessary repairs. NHTSA reviews draft recall letters to ensure they contain necessary information about the safety defect, including a clear description of the defect, an evaluation of the risk to vehicle safety, and a statement that the manufacturer will remedy the defect without charge. The number of vehicles affected by safety defect recalls has increased significantly since 2011, with large-scale recalls such as General Motors' ignition switch issue and the Takata air bag inflator recalls, which have impacted over 34 million vehicles. The Takata recall involved a Coordinated Remedy Program with an Independent Monitor. Despite these efforts, recall completion rates have remained relatively flat, ranging from 63 to 67 percent between 2011 and 2014. NHTSA has been working to improve communication and consumer engagement to enhance recall completion rates. The agency has implemented various strategies, such as providing auto recall information on its website, offering VIN look-up tools, and promoting awareness through social media and other channels. The report highlights that consumers primarily rely on mail for recall notifications, but many prefer additional electronic methods such as email, phone calls, and text messages. However, the current practices do not align with these preferences, creating a gap that needs to be addressed. NHTSA has been working with industry stakeholders to identify ways to encourage consumers to complete repairs. For instance, one manufacturer introduced a pilot program allowing third-party service providers to repair vehicles at the owner's home or workplace, while another manufacturer collaborates with dealers to hold special events for recall repairs after regular business hours. The report also discusses the challenges consumers face in completing repairs, such as the inconvenience of scheduling and the time required for repairs. It emphasizes that safety risk and convenience are the two most significant factors influencing consumers' decisions to complete repairs. The report found that while the safety risk information is required in recall letters, consumers often find it unclear or vague. As a result, some consumers may not take the necessary steps to repair their vehicles. The report also discusses the use of publicly available auto recall information by industry stakeholders, such as auto manufacturers, franchised dealers, and independent dealers.

Once a defect is identified, auto manufacturers are required to send written notification to vehicle owners by mail. NHTSA also aims to enhance awareness of auto recalls by providing information on its website, NHTSA.gov . The Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act includes a provision requiring GAO to study the use of publicly available safety recall information. This report addresses: (1) how consumers and industry stakeholders use such information and (2) how easy to use do consumers find the auto recall areas of NHTSA.gov, among other objectives. To understand consumers' use of auto recall information and to test website usability, GAO conducted 12 focus groups with 94 consumers who had a recall. Focus groups were held in six locations selected for population and geographic variation. GAO identified key website usability practices and requested an evaluation by website usability professionals. GAO reviewed statutes, regulations, and NHTSA documents, and interviewed industry stakeholders—including 10 manufacturers selected based on sales market share and other factors. Consumers, manufacturers, and auto dealers use publicly available auto recall information differently. For example, the 94 consumers in 12 focus groups that GAO conducted used this information to decide whether to repair their vehicles. These consumers overwhelmingly cited safety risk and convenience as the two most influential factors they considered. Most consumers reported a preference for receiving recall notification by at least one electronic means, such as by e-mail or text message, in addition to mail. However, only 7 of 94 consumers reported receiving electronic notifications, suggesting a gap between the industry's auto recall notification practices and consumers' preferences. (See fig.). In response to a mandate in law, in September 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a proposed rule that, if finalized, would require manufacturers to notify consumers about auto recalls by electronic means in addition to mail. Most consumers in GAO's focus group website usability tests found the auto recall areas of NHTSA's website—NHTSA.gov—easy to use; however, some consumers experienced difficulties when asked to complete auto recall related tasks. For example, when consumers attempted to search for recalls affecting their specific vehicles, some found the search results confusing, leading them to question the accuracy of the results. Similarly, some consumers were hampered in searching for recalls by their vehicles' year, make, and model because the website did not always display model options using plain language. GAO found that the auto recall areas of NHTSA.gov do not always reflect federal and industry key website usability practices, and that an independent evaluation conducted by website usability professionals at GAO's request identified similar issues. NHTSA is in the process of consolidating its websites and plans to conduct a website usability study of NHTSA.gov with consumers after the consolidation is complete. However, the agency has not determined a completion date for the consolidation effort—an essential step for organizations to effectively guide their information technology efforts. Without establishing a completion date and taking interim steps to improve the usability of NHTSA.gov, consumers will likely continue to experience difficulties, which may limit the effectiveness of the website's primary means of providing consumers with information about recalls affecting their vehicles.

Let me start by reading through the report again to make sure I understand the key points. \n\nFirst, the report explains what cluster munitions are. They are weapons that open in mid-air and release submunitions, which can range from dozens to hundreds. They can be delivered by aircraft or ground systems like artillery, rockets, missiles. The military value is that one munition can attack many targets, so fewer weapons systems are needed. It's considered an \"economy of force\" weapon. \n\nThen there's a part about the history. Cluster bombs were first used in WWII, and have been used in 21 states by 13 countries. The US used them extensively in Southeast Asia in the 60s and 70s, leading to a lot of unexploded submunitions in Laos. The ICRC estimates 9-27 million there, causing over 10k casualties. Then the Soviets in Afghanistan, the British in Falklands, the Coalition in the Gulf War, and the warring factions in Yugoslavia. In 1999, NATO dropped 1,765 cluster bombs with 295,000 submunitions. In 2001-2002, US dropped 1,228 with 248,056. In 2003, US and UK used 13,000 with 1.8-2 million. The US stopped using them after 2003. The report mentions the incident where cluster submunitions were the same color and size as food packets, leading to confusion and casualties. \n\nThen there's the part about the technical aspects. The submunitions use mechanical fuzes that arm based on spin, explode on impact or delay. Newer sensor-fuzed submunitions are being developed to improve accuracy and reduce unexploded ordnance. These are designed to target vehicles without creating a large hazard area. \n\nThe report also discusses the criticisms of cluster munitions.

Cluster munitions were developed in World War II and are part of many nations' weapons stockpiles. Cluster munitions have been used frequently in combat, including the early phases of the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Cluster munitions have been highly criticized internationally for causing a significant number of civilian deaths, and efforts have been undertaken to ban and regulate their use. The Department of Defense (DOD) continues to view cluster munitions as a military necessity but in 2008 instituted a policy to reduce the failure rate of cluster munitions to 1% or less after 2018. In November 2017, a new DOD policy was issued that essentially reversed the 2008 policy. Under the new policy, combatant commanders can use cluster munitions that do not meet the 1% or less unexploded submunitions standard in extreme situations to meet immediate warfighting demands. In addition, the new policy does not establish a deadline to replace cluster munitions exceeding the 1% rate and states that DOD \"will retain cluster munitions currently in active inventories until the capabilities they provide are replaced with enhanced and more reliable munitions.\" Potential issues for Congress include cluster munitions in an era of precision weapons, other weapons in lieu of cluster munitions, and the potential impact of DOD's 2017 revised cluster munitions policy."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3162}
{"pred": " The report provides an in-depth analysis of FEMA's Public Assistance (PA) program, which is a critical component of the federal response to major disasters. The PA program provides funding to states, local governments, tribal organizations, and certain private nonprofit entities to repair damaged public infrastructure such as roads, schools, and bridges. The program is managed by FEMA's Office of Response and Recovery, and it operates under two authorities: the Stafford Act and Title 5. The PA workforce is composed of a mix of temporary, reservist, and permanent employees, with reservists making up the largest share. The program's new delivery model aims to streamline the grant application process, enhance information sharing, and promote hazard mitigation in recovery efforts. The report highlights several challenges that FEMA has faced in managing the PA program, including workforce management issues, information sharing difficulties, and the integration of hazard mitigation into PA projects. Past issues included a shortage of experienced staff, reliance on temporary rotating staff, and limited training, which led to delays in recovery efforts after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. These problems were exacerbated by staff turnover and information sharing challenges. In response to these challenges, FEMA implemented the PA Consistency Initiative, which included hiring new managers for FEMA regional offices, stakeholder training on PA program administration, and the use of an internal website to share information. Despite these efforts, the report found that some challenges, such as workforce levels and training, still persist. For example, during the test implementation of the new model in Georgia following Hurricane Matthew, there were not enough site inspectors or program delivery managers to manage the workload. The report also discusses FEMA's efforts to improve the PA program through the new delivery model, which includes changes to workforce management, training, and the development of a new information system called FAC-Trax. The new model also incorporates hazard mitigation into the PA grant application process earlier than previously done. The report evaluates the effectiveness of the new model and identifies areas for improvement. The report also assesses the development of FAC-Trax against four key IT management controls: project planning, risk management, requirements development, and systems testing and integration. The report found that FEMA's development of FAC-Trax fully satisfied best practices for project planning and risk management, but additional steps are needed to fully satisfy the areas of requirements development and systems testing and integration. The report concludes with five recommendations to FEMA's Assistant Administrator for Recovery to address the identified challenges and improve the PA program's effectiveness. The recommendations include completing a workforce staffing assessment, establishing controls for tracking FAC-Trax capabilities to system requirements,", "answers": ["FEMA, an agency of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has obligated more than $36 billion in PA grants to state, local, and tribal governments to help communities recover and rebuild after major disasters since 2009. Further, costs are rising with disasters, such as Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in 2017. FEMA recently redesigned how the PA program delivers assistance to state and local grantees to improve operations and address past challenges identified by GAO and others. FEMA tested the new delivery model in selected disasters and announced implementation in September 2017. GAO was asked to assess the redesigned PA program. This report examines, among other things, the extent to which FEMA's new delivery model addresses (1) past workforce management challenges and assesses future workforce needs; and (2) past information sharing challenges and key IT management controls. GAO reviewed FEMA policy, strategy, and implementation documents; interviewed FEMA and state officials, PA program applicants, and other stakeholders; and observed implementation of the new model at one test location following Hurricane Matthew in 2016. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) redesigned the Public Assistance (PA) grant program delivery model to address past challenges in workforce management, but has not fully assessed future workforce staffing needs. GAO and others have previously identified challenges related to shortages in experienced and trained FEMA PA staff and high turnover among these staff. These challenges often led to applicants receiving inconsistent guidance and to PA project delays. As part of its new model, FEMA is creating consolidated resource centers to standardize and centralize PA staff responsible for managing grant applications, and new specialized positions, such as hazard mitigation liaisons, program delivery managers, and site inspectors, to ensure more consistent guidance to applicants. However, FEMA has not assessed the workforce needed to fully implement the new model, such as the number of staff needed to fill certain new positions, or to achieve staffing goals for supporting hazard mitigation on PA projects. Fully assessing workforce needs will help to ensure that FEMA has the people and the skills needed to fully implement the new PA model and help to avoid the long-standing workforce challenges the program encountered in the past. FEMA designed a new PA information and case management system—called the FEMA Applicant Case Tracker (FAC-Trax)—to address past information sharing challenges, such as difficulties in sharing grant documentation among FEMA, state, and local officials and tracking the status of PA projects, but additional actions could better ensure effective implementation. Both FEMA and state officials involved in testing of the new model stated that the new information system allows them to better manage and track PA applications and documentation, which could lead to greater transparency and efficiencies in the program. Further, GAO found that this new system fully addresses two of four key information technology (IT) management controls—project planning and risk management—that are necessary to ensure systems work effectively and meet user needs. However, GAO found that FEMA has not fully addressed the other two controls—requirements development and systems testing and integration. By better analyzing progress on high-level user requirements, for example, FEMA will have greater assurance that FAC-Trax will meet user needs and achieve the goals of the new delivery model. GAO is making five recommendations, including that FEMA assess the workforce needed for the new delivery model and improve key IT management controls for its new information sharing and case management system, FAC-Trax.

DOE typically accounts for about 80% of the bill's funding. President Trump submitted his FY2020 detailed budget proposal to Congress on March 18, 2019 (after submitting a general budget overview on March 11). The budget requests for agencies included in the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill total $38.02 billion—$6.64 billion (15%) below the FY2019 appropriation. The largest exception to the overall decrease proposed for energy and water programs is a $1.309 billion increase (12%) for DOE nuclear weapons activities. For FY2019, the conference agreement on H.R. 5895 (H.Rept. 115-929) provided total Energy and Water Development appropriations of $44.66 billion—3% above the FY2018 level, excluding supplemental funding, and 23% above the FY2019 request. It was signed by the President on September 21, 2018 (P.L. 115-244).

Major Energy and Water Development funding issues for FY2020 are listed below. They were selected based on the total funding involved, the percentage of proposed increases or decreases, and potential impact on broader public policy considerations. Water Agency Funding Reductions. The Trump Administration requested reductions of 31% for USACE and 29% for Reclamation for FY2020 from the FY2019 enacted levels. The largest reductions would be from USACE Operation and Maintenance (-48%) and Reclamation's Water and Related Resources account (-31%). Similar reductions proposed by the Administration for FY2019 were not enacted. Power Marketing Administration (PMA) Reforms. DOE's FY2020 budget request includes mandatory proposals to sell PMA electricity transmission lines and other assets, repeal certain PMA borrowing authority, and eliminate cost-based limits on the electricity rates charged by the PMAs. The proposals would need to be enacted in authorizing legislation. Termination of Energy Efficiency Grants. DOE's Weatherization Assistance Program and State Energy Program would be terminated under the FY2020 budget request. The Administration had proposed to eliminate the grants in FY2018 and FY2019, but Congress continued funding. Reductions in Energy Research and Development. Under the FY2020 budget request, DOE research and development appropriations would be reduced for energy efficiency and renewable energy (EERE) by 83%, nuclear energy by 38%, and fossil energy by 24%. Similar reductions proposed by the Administration for FY2019 were not enacted. Nuclear Waste Repository. The Administration's budget request would provide new funding for the first time since FY2010 for a proposed nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, NV. DOE would receive $116 million to seek an NRC license for the repository and develop interim waste storage capacity. NRC would receive $38.5 million to consider DOE's repository license application. Similar Administration funding requests for FY2018 and FY2019 were not enacted. Elimination of Advanced Research Projects Agency—Energy (ARPA-E). The Trump Administration proposes no new appropriations for ARPA-E in FY2020 and to cancel $287 million in unobligated balances from previous appropriations. Similar proposals to terminate ARPA-E in FY2018 and FY2019 were not enacted. Loan Programs Termination. The FY2020 budget request would terminate DOE's Title 17 Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program, the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, and the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program. Administration proposals to eliminate the programs were not included in the enacted appropriations measures for FY2018 and FY2019. Weapons Activities. The FY2020 budget request for DOE Weapons Activities is 12% greater than it was in FY2019 ($12.4 billion vs. $11.1 billion), in contrast to a proposed 10% reduction in DOE's total funding. Notable proposed increases would be used for warhead life extension programs and preparations for increase production of plutonium pits (warhead cores)."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8323}

CDC has a large staff of approximately 20,000 employees and a budget of about $12 billion for fiscal year 2017. The agency has a significant reliance on information technology to fulfill its mission and support administrative needs. The agency has a complex information technology infrastructure that includes network components, critical servers, and data centers. The CDC has a chief information officer (CIO) who is responsible for establishing and enforcing policies and procedures protecting information resources. The CIO is to lead the efforts to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information and systems that support the agency and its operations. The CIO is to report quarterly to the HHS CIO on the overall effectiveness of CDC's information security and privacy program, including the progress of remedial actions. The CIO designated a chief information security officer (CISO), who is to oversee compliance with applicable information security and privacy requirements of the agency. The CISO, among other things, is responsible for providing information security protections commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, and disruption of information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency. To ensure information security compliance, information systems security officers (ISSO) are responsible for managing the information security program within their respective organizations and report on security program matters to the CISO, including computer security-related incidents. ISSO responsibilities include ensuring that vendor-issued security patches are expeditiously installed and that system owners establish processes for timely removal of access privileges when a user’s system access is no longer necessary. Further, security stewards perform operational security analyses supporting the efforts of the ISSO.

The U.S. joined in 2014, but hostilities started in March 2015, leading the Obama administration to provide logistical and intelligence support without direct military action. A joint planning cell was set up. Then there's the UN resolution 2216 in April 2015, which imposed an arms embargo on the Houthi-Saleh forces. \n\nThen it talks about Congress's role in debating and overseeing U.S. policy in Yemen. They considered various legislative proposals to reduce civilian casualties, improve humanitarian conditions, end restrictions on goods and aid, combat Iranian support, preserve maritime security, and support continued efforts against Al Qaeda and Islamic State. The lawmakers also viewed the conflict through the lens of a broader regional rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and the U.S. effort to limit Iran's malign regional influence. The killing of Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018 further deepened concerns about the U.S.-Saudi relationship. \n\nThe report mentions that Congress has considered but not enacted proposals to curtail or condition U.S. defense sales to Saudi Arabia.
