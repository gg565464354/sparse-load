The main objective of the Pdp is to create a portable system that can handle natural language processing. The system must be able, and there must be a way of which user input is taken into consideration. The user's input is essential, and therefore, the system must have a way for which users can input their preferences. The input is necessary, and thus, the user's preference must be included in the system. The task is not to limit the user but to allow them to express themselves freely.

The smart kom team members' task is the development and improvement of the existing system. Therefore, the smartkom team members must be willing to share their ideas and suggestions.

The touch screen should not have any function, and its touchpad should be incorporated into the smart remote.

The L_CDL display would provide access to all functions, and voice recognition would be included.

However, the expert also thinks that the user identification feature should not be too complicated, and the remote must be easy enough to use. The expert suggests that the feature should be added to the user's experience rather than being a separate function. The marketing specialist also thinks it is essential to have user identification features, especially voice recognition, to make remote controls smarter. Finally, the marketing specialist thinks that voice recognition is challenging, and therefore, the remote's voice recognition system should not rely solely on voice recognition. Instead, the system should be speaker-dependent, allowing the remote to recognize voices without requiring the user to repeat themselves. The speaker-independent voice recognition feature would require additional technology, making it more expensive. Therefore, the speaker-independent feature would be more expensive, and it is not necessary to add it to the system. The remote control should be designed to be easy-to-use, and its design should be innovative, and not necessarily practical. The innovation feature should focus on the remote itself, while the practicality feature should concentrate on the user.

The user experience should be the top priority, and this should be considered during the design process. The designer should prioritize the user identity feature, which should not compromise the remote design's feasibility. The designers should prioritize user identity features, which would allow the remote controller to recognize the user, and voice recognition would be a speaker-dependent feature.
