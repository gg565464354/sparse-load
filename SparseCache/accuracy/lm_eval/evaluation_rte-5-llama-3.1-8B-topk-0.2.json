True or False?\nAnswer: True\n\nIndia's steelmaker Tata Steel, of the Tata Group, buys Anglo-Dutch steel giant Corus Group for \u00a36.7 billion ($12 billion), making it the world's fifth largest steel manufacturer. 70-year-old Tata group Chairman Ratan Tata, from one of India's best-known business families, won the race against Benjamin Steinbruch, 52, a famous Brazilian executive who is the chief and main owner of Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN). Tata paid investors 608 pence a share, whereas the Brazilians final offer in an auction by the U.K.'s Takeover Panel was 603 pence. The deal triples Tata Steel's capacity to almost 28 million tons a year. Tata: \"This is the first step in showing that Indian industry can step outside its shores into an international market place as a global player.\" Corus, which was created from the merger of British Steel and Hoogovens, currently employs 47,300 people worldwide.

To many people, Mr Obama seemed to come from nowhere.

            "Contrast the Leitrim story with that of Rita Levi-Montalcini, an Italian Nobel laureate who turned 100 last Wednesday. She still attends for work every day at the European Brain Research Institute in Rome, which she founded. She was appointed a senator for life in 2001, and in 2006, aged 97, she attended the opening assembly of the newly elected senate. She takes part in discussions in the Upper House, and in 2004 defended the teaching of evolution in Italian schools. There is no record of her having claimed a day off because of festival commitments. Apparently she even manages to work right through the Rose of Tralee without lifting her head from her Petri dish.\nQuestion: Rita Levi-Montalcini is a Nobel prize winner. True or False?\nAnswer: True\n\nTwenty-four people, among them seven children, were killed on Sunday after their airplane crashed in a river in Brazil. Four people survived the crash, including a 9-year-old boy. The aircraft, which was a twin-engine Embraer turboprop chartered by Manaus Aerotaxis, was carrying 26 passengers and two crew members when it crashed. The pilots of the plane, which had departed from Coari, had supposedly contacted the air traffic control near their destination of Manaus to announce  that they were turning back. The plane, however, then disappeared from radar. The plane made an emergency landing in the river Manacapuru, a branch the  Amazon river in the Brazilian state of Amazonas, 50 miles (80 kilometers) from Manaus.\nQuestion: 24 people died in an airplane crash. True or False?\nAnswer: True\n\nCanadian MP Belinda Stronach, 40, has reportedly cheated with Canadian hockey star Tie Domi. Domi and his wife were in court today getting divorced and both have now reached a temporary settlement in their divorce proceedings, less than an hour before the case was to be heard before Toronto's Superior Court. Stronach is refusing to comment on the divorce or say if she \"wrecked\" Domi's marriage. \"If it wasn't for my husband's affair with Belinda, we wouldn't be getting a divorce,\" Leanne told the Toronto Star in an interview last night. Domi's wife claimed that the former Toronto Maple Leaf player told her if she did not hire a lawyer he would give her $1 million in cash and a $1.5-million house if she kept quiet about his affair with Stronach. If she contacted a lawyer, however, she \"would get nothing.\"\nQuestion: Leanne was married to Tie Domi. True or False?\nAnswer: True\n\nBilly Werber, third baseman in Major League Baseball, has died at the age of 100. Werber died of natural causes on Thursday, January 22, 2009 at an assisted living center in Charlotte, North Carolina. He was moved there after his health deteriorated a month ago. His son said that when admitted, Werber refused to eat solid foods and would only drink liquids. \"He just refused to eat and that was his plan,\" Bill Werber Jr. told the Associated Press. He added that his father was \"sharp up until four weeks ago\".\nQuestion: Werber died in North Carolina at the age of 100.

On Friday, the official count was seven dead, at least five missing. 4 people in Broward, 3 in Miami. The forecast for Hurricane  Katrina predicts that it will continue on its present northwesterly course and approach the panhandle of Florida and the Mississippi delta region in the next few days.\nQuestion: Hurricane Katrina hit Florida.

The Pope arrived at Okecie airport in Warsaw on May 25. He met with President Lech Kaczynski and prayed in an evangelic-augsburg church together with representatives of seven minor Polish churches. The following day he said mass at Pilsudski Square, mirroring a precedent set by his predecessor 27 years earlier. Benedict XVI talked in Latin and in small parts in Polish.

MOR 1125 was 18 years old when it died, 65 million years ago. Similar tissue of a dinosaur has never been found before, as all remains found until now were fosilized. The tissue still contains microscopic structures resembling bloodvessels and cells. The comparison between the structures found in the T-rex and a modern day Ostrich shows a remarkable similarity. The results have been duplicated with an 80-million-year-old hadrosaur and two other tyrannosaurs. The discovery was reported in today's issue of Science. Results similar to the popular film \"Jurassic park\" are unlikely, as the recovery of DNA from the tissue is improbable. The results remain astounding, however, and tests with antibodies that react to collagen shows the tissue may still contain proteins. \"Ultimately if we could establish chemical composition, we would have insights into all kinds of things: diet, sexual maturity, whether the specimen is the male or female.\", paleontologist Hans-Dieter Sues said.\nQuestion: Paleontologist Hans-Dieter Sues and other scientists discovered a T Rex bone in Montana.

            "Washington - Egyptologists researching a mummy first discovered in 1898 believe it is the mummy of Queen Nefertiti, a legendary beauty and wife of the renegade pharaoh Akhenaten, the Discovery Channel said on Monday. Virtually all traces of Nefertiti and her \"heretic\" husband, who ruled from 1353-1336 BC, were erased after his unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the pantheon of the gods to worship the sun god Aton - among the earliest known practices of monotheism. Nefertiti also was stepmother of the boy-king Tutankhamen, whose tomb was discovered in 1922.\nQuestion: Nefertiti was a queen.

That's about three quarters of the estimated 5.5 million children of illegal immigrants inside the United States, according to the study.

True or False?\nAnswer: False\n\nLast month, the FBI's Washington Field Office began an internal recruitment drive to staff a new anti-obscenity squad. The job of the new squad would be to gather evidence against the \"manufacturers and purveyors\" of pornography, and would require eight agents, a supervisor and assorted support help. The squad would not be concerned with child pornography, but instead focus on pornography that depicts, and is marketed to, consenting adults. The squad would target bestiality, urination, defecation, and sadomasochistic behavior, which have a high rate of conviction in jury trials. The initiative is described as \"one of the top priorities\" of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, as well as FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III.
